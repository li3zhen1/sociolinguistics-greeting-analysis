   ABSTRACT   = {This paper provides an analytical framework for studying the relationship between conventionalised expressions and speech acts. In certain languages, such as Chinese, the relationship between expressions and speech acts tends to be straightforward. In other languages, such as English, this relationship is more casual. Notwithstanding this linguacultural difference, expressions associated with particular speech acts in these two languages can fulfil other pragmatic functions than simply indicating the speech acts that are conventionally associated with them. To capture such alternative uses of these expressions, we propose the superordinate category of ‘altered’ speech act indication which consists of a system of three analytical pairs. We investigate such altered speech act indication from a contrastive pragmatic angle by drawing on English and Chinese corpora. In particular, we study the expressions that are associated with the speech acts Thank and Greet.}

   ABSTRACT   = "{This paper investigates the phenomenon of greeting in English, which can be surprisingly challenging for speakers of other languages, such as Chinese. By ‘greeting’ we mean the seemingly ‘simple’ act of choosing conventionalized expressions at the opening of an encounter. Following pilot interviews with Chinese learners of English who reported puzzlement concerning greeting in English, we pursue a two-fold approach to explore conventions of greeting in English and Chinese. First, we use corpora to investigate pragmatic differences and similarities between conventionalized uses of English and Chinese comparable Greet expressions, examining them separately and then conducting a contrastive analysis. This step helps us capture the contextual spread of Greet expressions in English and Chinese. Second, we elicit production data from speakers of English and Chinese to investigate their behaviour in the broader opening phase of an interaction across various contexts. The results of the study help us understand in a differentiated way the puzzlement that certain groups of learners of English feel when it comes to greeting.}",

   ABSTRACT   = {This study examines response variables to the question “How are you doing?” and also judgments by subjects of “good” used as an adverb. Sociolinguistic literature, grammar books, and dictionaries are reviewed as background for the study. Data include responses of 351 individuals to the question “How are you doing?” and 80 individuals to options on two surveys. Age groups and genders are compared, using the Chi square test to determine significant differences, and the results are presented and discussed. Responses to “How are you doing?” indicate a possible sociolinguistic variable influenced by age and gender. The response “good” appears more acceptable to younger respondents and to males more than females overall. The surveys show that subjects generally do not accept “good” in an adverbial position as correct but that subjects in their twenties use “good” as an adverb in their speech more than subjects in their sixties and over.},

   ABSTRACT   = {The literature on greetings includes several commonly made claims that require an agreed-upon definition of what constitutes a greeting exchange. I propose six criteria for identifying greetings across languages and speech communities. Applying these criteria to a speech community in Western Samoa, I identify four types of greeting exchanges there. These exchanges show, contra claims in the greetings literature, that not all greetings are devoid ofpropositional content and that they need not be 'expressive' acts of the type proposed by speech act theory. In greetings, Samoans accomplish various social acts, including searching for new information and sanctioning social behavior.},

abstract = {In order to trace the evolution of greeting culture from pre-modern China to modern society, this study investigates 483 greetings between new acquaintances (GBNAs) collected from 6 works of the 17th-18th centuries and 9 novels of the mid-20th century. The results show that, in both periods Chinese GBNAs are highly situation-dependent and primarily performed in the mode of “seeking information - confirming”. The changes are first and foremost manifested in three respects. First, the GBNAs in the 20th century exhibit a tendency of “impersonalization” in terms of topic selection and the use of sentence patterns. Second, generally speaking, the GBNAs in the 20th century are semantically more informative. Third, the disappearance of asymmetric addressing and the decrease of honorifics indicate that the traditional politeness maxim of “self-denigration and other-elevation” is gradually discarded in modern China. It is argued that the evolution of GBNAs might be attributed to both the New Culture Movement and the modernization of traditional society.}
