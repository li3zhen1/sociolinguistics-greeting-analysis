00:00:00,220 --> 00:00:04,450


2
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:14,450


3
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:20,450


4
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,440
基於真實故事

5
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:37,380
1953年肯尼亞在基庫尤人組成的茅茅黨帶領下

6
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,010
爆發了反對英國殖民統治的武裝起義

7
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:46,730
在這場鬥爭中  數千人喪生

8
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:51,740
超過一百萬基庫尤人被送入拘留營

9
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:55,750
鬥爭終於贏來了獨立

10
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:00,010
但是對很多人來說  過去難以釋懷

11
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:01,710
片名:  「一年級生」

12
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,450
同胞們，同胞們
My People, my people.

13
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,160
現在，新政府宣佈
Now, the new government has announced

14
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:12,540
全民享受免費教育
free education for all.

15
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:17,080
他們只要你出現帶著出生證明來
All they want is for you to turn up with a birth certificate.

16
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:21,670
一個會信守諾言的政府?  難以置信!
A government that keeps its promise? Unbelievable!

17
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,910
我兒子需要接受教育
My son needs to be educated.

18
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,750
他叫卡莫.切赫，卡莫.切赫 切赫！

00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,560
凱瑟琳老師!

22
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,260
凱瑟琳老師  你能來一下嗎?
Teacher Katherine, can you come?

23
00:04:57,430 --> 00:04:59,930
好的  請給我一點時間
OK, give me a moment, please.

24
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:03,400
這張不是出生證  老媽媽  你不是最先到的
This is not a birth certificate. Mama, you are not the first.

25
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,650
有什麼可以幫到你的? 老人家
May' help you, mzee?

26
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,650
這裡是一所小學
This is a primary school.

27
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:22,440
"新政府承諾全民可免費接受初等教育"
"The new government promises free primary education for all"

28
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:25,970
老人家，他們指的是孩子，不是成年人
Mzee, they meant children, not adults.

29
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:30,460
不  我親耳從收音機裡聽到的
No. I heard on the radio, with my own ears.

30
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,090
他們說每個人都可以
They said everybody.

31
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,300
我們有200個學生卻只有50張桌子  看看這個
We have 200 students and only 50 desks. Look at this.

32
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:40,340
我們不能把它們浪費在一個一隻腳進墳墓的老人身上
We can't waste them on an old man with one foot in the grave.

33
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:43,010
老人家，你的練習本在哪裡？
Mzee, where are your exercise books?

34
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:46,400
你要有兩個練習本  以及一支鋒利的HB鉛筆
You need two, and one HB pencil, sharp,

35
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,930
一頭帶橡皮擦
with a rubber on one end.

36
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:50,150
這些是入學規定
Those are the regulations.

37
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,100
不，老人家，不
Pole, mzee. Pole.

38
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,490
馬魯格  馬魯格

39
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,490
一起來喝酒吧!  人生苦短  啤酒甘美
Let's have a drink! Life is short beer is sweet

40
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:30,490
馬魯格才不屑跟我們一起喝酒呢!
Maruge doesn't care to drink with us!

41
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,660
早上好  孩子們
Good morning, boys and girls.

00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,840
現在，我知道你們有些人可能有點緊張
Now, I know that some of you may be a little nervous,

50
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,750
但是沒什麼好害怕的

51
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,680
學習就是要有樂趣，所以我們都是來這裡找樂趣的

而且每個人都有鉛筆嗎？有!
And has everybody got their pencils? Yes!

56
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:17,230

OK. Good...I heard a few noes. Who said no?

我們不能接收沒穿校服的人

71
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,330
而且這也意味著要穿校鞋
and that means school shoes too.

72
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,210
而且你沒錢買這些東西
And you do not have money for such things.

73
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,540
珍妮? Jane?

74
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:28,310
老人家，為什麼你那麼老了還想上學
Mzee, why does someone as old as you want to go to school?

75
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,390
我想學習閱讀

76
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:33,350

你記得我跟你說過的那個老頭嗎？

這個可憐的老男孩可能老了

你為什麼不堅持你能贏的戰役，嗯？

瑞典公司沒付我咨詢費

政府的工作開始聽起來很有吸引力
The government job is starting to sound very appealing.

92
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,040
除了必須待在奈洛比做全職這一點
Except it had to be full time in Nairobi,

93
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,380
然後我們就再也見不到對方了
and then we'd never see each other at all.

94
00:11:02,540 --> 00:11:04,510
如果你也來奈洛比的話就不會了
Not if you came to Nairobi.

95
00:11:04,670 --> 00:11:09,550
我們將住在一所大房子裡，生孩子

你好女士  我要買些衣服

幫我放到一邊

還有孩子坐地板上
There are children sitting on the floor.

110
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:48,170
他們不能這樣學習，奇普托先生
They can't work like this, Mr Kipruto.

111
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:56,100
你需要為每一個新生的孩子準備一份表格，一式三份？
You need a form for every single new child, in triplicate?

112
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:59,050
不，你不是認真的 我沒時間這麼做，奇普托先生
No, you can't be serious. I don't have time to do that, Mr Kipruto.

113
00:13:59,210 --> 00:14:01,640
你能不能僅僅相信我的話?
Could you not just take my word for it?

114
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,100
是的，我知道，要按規定

115
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,390
我也祝你日安，奇普托先生
Good day to you too, Mr Kipruto.

116
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,570
我該怎麼辦? 阿爾佛雷德
What am I to do, Alfred?

117
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:15,570
我們尊敬的首長已做出了一項行政決定
Our esteemed superintendent has made one of his executive decisions.

118
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,360
你一定要來看看這個
You've got to see this.

119
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,490
什麼? What?

120
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:39,260
你不會輕易放棄的，對吧? 馬魯格
You don't give up easily, do you, Maruge?

121
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,720
你不能上當
You can't fall for this.

122
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,180
當局會找你麻煩的
You'll be asking for trouble with the authorities.

123
00:14:44,340 --> 00:14:46,140
你知道他是對的，馬魯格？

我怎麼向教育委員會交代?
What will I say to the board of education?

125
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,640
嗯? Hm?

126
00:14:50,810 --> 00:14:53,980
我該怎麼跟孩子們的父母交代?
What will I say to the parents?

127
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:56,360
我會當個好學生
I'll be a good pupil.

128
00:14:57,690 --> 00:14:59,160
我會努力學習
I'll work very hard.

129
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:00,690
如果奇浦路托發現...
If Kipruto finds out...

130
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:03,110
奇浦路托不是這裡的頭兒，阿爾弗雷德

131
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:05,580

147
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,340

00:33:01,830 --> 00:33:02,700
自由! 自由!

烏乎魯! 烏乎魯!
Uhuru! Uhuru!

308
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:05,460
烏乎魯! 烏乎魯!
Uhuru! Uhuru!

309
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,920
自由! 自由!
Freedom! Freedom!

310
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,460
烏乎魯! 烏乎魯!
Uhuru! Uhuru!

311
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,590
這是怎麼回事?
What is this?

312
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,130
他會給我們所有人帶來麻煩的
He's going to be a problem, for all of us.

313
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,650
來吧! 到外面來，並開始工作
Come on! Come outside and start working.

314
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:40,890
我跟你說
Let me tell you something

315
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,700
米歇爾·奧巴馬(美國第一夫人)
Michelle Obama (first lady of the United States)

316
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,640
是南非人
is South African

317
00:33:43,850 --> 00:33:45,440
不對  她是肯尼亞人
No, she's Kenyan

318
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:47,440
她曾經跟我女兒一起上學
She went to school with my daughter

319
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:50,440
你們什麼都不知道
You guys know nothing

320
00:33:59,850 --> 00:34:01,440
他跟那些小孩一塊上學很不妥當
It's not proper for him to go to school with those children

321
00:35:25,810 --> 00:35:28,160
聽著，朋友
Listen, my friend.

322
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:31,230
不一定要這樣
It doesn't have to be like this.

323
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:37,490
放棄你的誓言，你就可以回家了
Renounce your oath and you can go home.

324
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:45,870
放棄你的誓言!
Renounce the oath!

325
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:48,620
再來 Again.

326
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,190
同胞們，我的同胞們
People, my people

327
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,730
我聽到有傳聞說
I'm hearing rumblings

328
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:18,000
一位老人實際上已經回到了學校
that an old man has actually gone back to school.

329
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,950
一個老人回學校了！
An old man going back to school!

330
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,190
難以置信 Unbelievable.

331
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:24,500
做得很好
Excellent work.

332
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,530
來，卡卯
Come, Kamau.

333
00:37:28,210 --> 00:37:30,210
我們看看你的作業做的怎樣
Let's see what you have done.

334
00:37:30,370 --> 00:37:31,880
你的很好
Your one's very good.

335
00:37:32,040 --> 00:37:33,540
非常好，非常好
Very good, very good.

336
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,960
卡卯，你的"5"又寫錯了
Your fives again, Kamau.

337
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:38,720
我們沒複習過這個嗎? 我們複習過了的
Did we not go over this? Yes.

338
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,810
那你為什麼又把它們寫錯了呢？
So why have you written them the wrong way again?

339
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,350
嗯? Hm?

340
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:45,120
卡卯，你必須再寫一遍
You have to write them again, Kamau.

341
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:47,530
知道了嗎? 知道了 老師
Sawa? Yes, Miss.

342
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:51,000
馬魯格? Maruge?

343
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,230
非常好 Excellent.

344
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:55,970
你的數字學得很好，馬魯格
You are good with your numbers, Maruge.

345
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:58,410
出色的工作
Excellent work.

346
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:01,450
非常好  我很為你高興
Very good. I'm very happy with you.

347
00:38:01,610 --> 00:38:05,960
來吧，法蘭西斯 讓我們看看你做了什麼
Come, Francis. Let's take a look at what you have done.

348
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:09,320
哦，我喜歡  你的功課總是很整潔
Oh, I like that. Your work is always very neat.

349
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:11,460
你是個很聰明的孩子
You're a very clever boy.

350
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:13,420
好的 非常好
OK. Excellent.

351
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:16,300
因為你做得很好，你會得到一顆星
Because you have done so well, you're going to get a star.

352
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,830
噢! 你弄疼我了!
Ow! You're hurting me!

353
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,330
馬魯格! Maruge!

354
00:38:46,490 --> 00:38:49,460
你不能打他!
You do not hit him!

355
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:54,300
老實說，女人告訴我基庫尤人骨子裡有瘋狂的血液
Honestly, ladies tell me Kikuyus have mad blood,

356
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:56,510
但是他們背後的故事又是另一回事了
but their back story's another one.

357
00:38:56,670 --> 00:38:59,220
基庫尤人像種馬一樣工作 他們非常...
Kikuyus work like stallions. They're very...

358
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,010
馬魯格，住手! 馬魯格!
Maruge, stop it! Maruge!

359
00:39:03,490 --> 00:39:04,920
住手! 嘿!
Stop it! Hey!

360
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:08,720
嘿，嘿，嘿！這是怎麼回事？
Hey, hey, hey! What's going on here?

361
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:13,110
當我接到媒體的電話時，我簡直不敢相信自己的耳朵
I couldn't believe my ears when I got a phone call from the press

362
00:39:13,270 --> 00:39:15,650
告訴我在我的一所小學裡有一位老人！
telling me about an old man in one of my primary schools!

363
00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:18,030
他是誰? 為什麼他穿著校服?
Who is he? Why is he in school uniform?

364
00:39:20,070 --> 00:39:21,940
他叫馬魯格
His name is Maruge.

365
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,750
老人家 M Mzee

366
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,490
誰准許你進來的
Who allowed you in

367
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:34,370
他想上學，所以我就讓他進來了
He wanted to come to school, so I let him.

368
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:36,590
你什麼意思? 這是一所小學
What do you mean? This is a primary school.

369
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:39,340
先生，政府說每個人都有上學的權利
Sir, the government said everybody has the right to go to school.

370
00:39:39,530 --> 00:39:43,750
僅僅因為我們的政客愚蠢並不意味著我們也必須愚蠢！
Just because our politicians are stupid doesn't mean we have to be as well!

371
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,480
他不能待在這裡
He can't stay here.

372
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:48,390
成年人必須去成人學校
Adults must go to the adult school.

373
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,610
現在，確保他現在離開這裡
Now, see to it that he leaves here now.

374
00:39:52,930 --> 00:39:56,480
先生，他與英國人作戰
Sir, he fought the British.

375
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:00,240
他被囚禁在拘留營裡 哦，原來是茅茅黨的，蛤？
He was imprisoned in the camps. Oh, Mau Mau, huh?

376
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,740
典型基庫尤人  我早該知道的
Typical Kikuyu. I should have known.

377
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,870
你說什麼? Excuse me?

378
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:06,750
我以為部落主義已經結束了
I thought tribalism was over.

379
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,950
這跟部落主義沒關係
This has nothing to do with tribalism.

380
00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:10,970
這是為了做對學校有利的事
It's about doing what's right for the school.

381
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:14,470
像他這樣的老人不應該待在滿是孩子的教室裡 
An old man like him does not belong in a classroom full of children.

382
00:40:14,730 --> 00:40:17,650
現在，這件事我們到辦公室再繼續說
Now, we'll continue this conversation in the office.

383
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,260
馬魯格...Maruge...

384
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,850
他們是血腥的卡倫金人
He's a bloody Kalenjin.

385
00:40:33,010 --> 00:40:34,690
你不也是嗎? 馬魯格
You too, Maruge?

386
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:38,150
你知道You were either for them or you were against them,
獨立後，我們都成了肯尼亞人
You know, after independence, we all became Kenyans.

387
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:39,690
卡倫金人是忠誠的！
The Kalenjins were loyalists!

388
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:42,110
我的家人也效忠英國人!
So were my family loyal to the British!

389
00:40:42,270 --> 00:40:44,650
想要活命的每個人都是!
So was everybody if they wanted to stay alive!

390
00:40:44,850 --> 00:40:48,980
別那樣看著我  英國人從來沒有給人們一個選擇
And don't look at me like that. The British never gave people a choice.

391
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:51,160
你要嘛支持他們，或者你要嘛反對他們
You were either for them or you were against them,

392
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:53,250
而如果你反對他們，他們就殺你
and if you were against them, they killed you.

393
00:40:53,450 --> 00:40:56,700
我有過孩子
I had children.

394
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,960
兩個孩子!
Two children!

395
00:41:00,040 --> 00:41:01,960
我有過一個家!
I had a family!

396
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:05,560
英國人把他們都殺了
The British killed them.

397
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,810
我們作出了選擇
We chose.

398
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:11,850
基庫尤人作出了選擇
The Kikuyus chose.

399
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:13,980
而我們也付出了代價
And we paid.

400
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,520
我們付出了代價!
We paid!

401
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:36,160
回去上課，回去上課，回去上課，回去上課
Come to class. Come to class, come to class, come to class.

402
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:39,670
回去上課，回去上課
Go to class, go to class.

403
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,860
他說我必須讓馬魯格退學
He says I've got to get rid of Maruge.

404
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:08,990
他要送他到成人學校
He's sending him off to the adult school.

405
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,870
他的同情心哪去了?
Where is his compassion?

406
00:42:11,030 --> 00:42:12,870
珍妮，珍妮，別說了
Jane, Jane, just stop.

407
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:14,660
他不是那麼說的
That's not what he's saying.

408
00:42:14,830 --> 00:42:17,250
他只是說馬魯格不能上小學
He's just saying Maruge cannot go to children's school.

409
00:42:17,410 --> 00:42:18,830
你為什麼要幫他辯護?
Why are you defending him?

410
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,300
英國人殺了他的家人  我們有責任去幫他
The British killed his family. We have a duty to help him.

411
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:25,390
茅茅黨也殺人，好嗎？
The Mau Mau killed people too, OK?

412
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:28,550
但是這跟老人上小學的事情無關
But that's got nothing to do with an old man going to a children's school.

413
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:29,710
好的 Fine.

414
00:42:29,890 --> 00:42:32,490
沒有人會為馬魯格而戰，所以我會的
No-one's going to fight for Maruge, so I will.

415
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,760
好的，請不要越過奇普托的頭
OK, please do not go over Kipruto's head.

416
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:37,180
我跟這些人一起工作而且我知道他們的情況
I work with these people and I know how they are.

417
00:42:37,350 --> 00:42:39,650
他們對此並不友好
They don't take kindly to this.

418
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:41,480
你知道我總是站在你這邊的
You know I'm always on your side.

419
00:42:41,670 --> 00:42:43,850
愛你 再見
Love you. 'Bye.

420
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,710
我很感激你的關心，但我無能為力
I appreciate your concern, but my hands are tied.

421
00:42:53,860 --> 00:42:56,370
馬魯格很努力學習
Maruge is such a hard worker.

422
00:42:57,410 --> 00:42:59,830
他是孩子們的好榜樣
He's a great role model for the children.

423
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,420
如果我們讓馬魯格入學，那我們怎麼拒絕其他人?
If we let Maruge in, how can we refuse others?

424
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:05,760
我們的學校可能會擠滿了老人
Our schools could be flooded with old people.

425
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,420
這將剝奪
This would be taking away

426
00:43:07,590 --> 00:43:10,260
我們為孩子們所需的寶貴資源
from the precious resources we need for our children.

427
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,770
感謝您抽出時間，秘書長女士
Thank you for your time, Madam Secretary.

428
00:43:14,930 --> 00:43:17,350
不客氣 You're welcome.

429
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:21,640
歐賓舒夫人，有個跟丹麥政府合作的顧問
Mrs Obinchu, one of the consultants working with the Danish Government,

430
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:23,190
叫查爾斯·歐賓舒
Charles Obinchu.

431
00:43:23,350 --> 00:43:25,020
查爾斯是我丈夫
Charles is my husband.

432
00:43:25,190 --> 00:43:27,940
代我想他問好 我會的
Give him my best. I will.

433
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:33,580
歐賓舒夫人，孩子是肯尼亞的未來
Mrs Obinchu, the children are Kenya's future.

434
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,430
對不起，馬魯格
I'm sorry, Maruge.

435
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:36,590
我沒錢，沒錢
I have no money, no money.

436
00:44:36,760 --> 00:44:38,140
天下沒有免費的午餐
There's nothing for free.

437
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,890
你太老了，走不動的
You cannot go, you're too old.

438
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:06,550
"成人學習中心  力求優秀"
"Adult learning centers strive for excellence"

439
00:45:41,740 --> 00:45:44,410
所以今天我們重點討論單數和複數
So today we're focusing on singular and plural.

440
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:46,540
讓我們從"床"開始，好嗎？
Let's start with 'bed', alright?

441
00:45:46,700 --> 00:45:48,960
所以，"bed"，bed的複數形式是beds
So, 'bed', the plural for 'bed' is 'beds'.

442
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,800
那就是B-E-D-S
That's B-E-D-S.

443
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:53,880
好的，所以你只要加一個"S"
Alright, so you just add an 'S'.

444
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,260
好的，現在，"lamp"的複數形式是...
Alright, now, the plural for 'lamp'...

445
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:57,840
請安靜 Please.

446
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:01,390
"lamp"的複數形式是...
The plural for 'lamp'...

447
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,550
好的，那"死亡"呢?
Alright, how about 'death'?

448
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:05,890
"死亡"的複數形式是...
The plural for 'death'...

449
00:46:17,860 --> 00:46:19,360
再見! 謝謝!
Kwa heri! Asante!

450
00:46:19,530 --> 00:46:20,900
待會見，老師
See you later, Teacher.

451
00:46:21,070 --> 00:46:22,740
馬魯格  你在這裡幹什麼?
Maruge, what are you doing here?

452
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:24,870
進來吧! Come inside.

453
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:28,750
我發誓要從英國人手裡奪回土地
I took the oath to get our land back from the British.

454
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:32,880
馬魯格，你不必告訴我這些
Maruge, you don't have to tell me this.

455
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,790
基庫尤人沒有土地意味著什麼?
What is Kikuyu without land?

456
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,180
馬賽人最看重的是牛
The Masai, it's cattle.

457
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,640
但我們最看重的是土地
But for us, it's land.

458
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,180
這就是我們抗爭的原因
That's why we were fighting.

459
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:50,230
但如果我們不識字，我們什麼都不是
But we are nothing if we cannot read.

460
00:46:50,390 --> 00:46:52,770
我們毫無用處
We are useless.

461
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:00,950
當我小時候
When I was a boy,

462
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:03,410
沒有錢用於教育
there was no money for education.

463
00:47:04,910 --> 00:47:07,630
我在一個白人的農場工作
I worked on a white man's farm.

464
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:13,040
然後就為自由而戰
Then came the fight for freedom.

465
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:15,170
馬魯格...Maruge...

466
00:47:15,330 --> 00:47:16,800
我有一封信
I have a letter.

467
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:18,340
你這話是什麼意思?
What do you mean?

468
00:47:18,500 --> 00:47:21,550
這就是我來學校的原因
That's why I came to the school.

469
00:47:21,710 --> 00:47:25,090
我必須親自看
I must read it for myself.

470
00:47:26,850 --> 00:47:29,850
我必須去理解
I have to understand.

471
00:47:30,890 --> 00:47:32,560
求你了 Please.

472
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:37,020
教我認字，歐賓舒夫人
Teach me to read, Mrs Obinchu.

473
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:46,450
噢! 我知道我們以前談過很多次關於馬魯格的事
Well, I know we've had this conversation many times before about Maruge,

474
00:47:46,610 --> 00:47:49,790
但我想知道你是否願意重新考慮一下
but I was wondering if you might be willing to reconsider.

475
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:52,500
奇普托先生，他們只是在成人學校混日子
Mr Kipruto, they just mess around at the adult school.

476
00:47:52,660 --> 00:47:54,210
他什麼也沒學到
He didn't learn a thing.

477
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,010
是的 Yes.

478
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:00,260
是的，我當然很感激
Yes, of course I'm grateful.

479
00:48:01,710 --> 00:48:03,260
再見 Kwa heri.

480
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:08,260
馬魯格，對不起  我已經盡力了...
Maruge, I'm very sorry. I've done everything...

481
00:48:08,430 --> 00:48:10,480
那個該死的奇普托可以下地獄！
That bloody Kipruto can go to hell!

482
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:12,110
成人學校總比沒有強...
The adult school is better than nothing...

483
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:13,690
我不去! I'm not going!

484
00:48:13,850 --> 00:48:17,980
他是卡倫金人 他的人民與英國人同床共枕
He's Kalenjin. His people were in bed with the British.

485
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:19,940
該死的忠誠者！
Bloody loyalist!

486
00:48:20,110 --> 00:48:22,950
我不去 不是我！
I'm not going. Not me!

487
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:25,780
讓他自己上別的學校吧!
Let him go to the other school himself!

504
00:49:18,870 --> 00:49:20,750
我是來說再見的
I came to say goodbye.

505
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:26,880
我告訴他們山羊不識字
I told them a goat cannot read.

506
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:31,770
山羊不會寫自己的名字
A goat cannot write his name.

507
00:49:32,890 --> 00:49:37,770
他們必須努力學習，否則他們會像我一樣
They must study hard, or they'll be like me

508
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:42,250
一個不比那隻山羊好多少的老人
an old man no better than that goat.

509
00:49:49,240 --> 00:49:53,040
你知道，山羊是非常聰明的動物
You know, goats are very clever animals.

510
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:55,290
他們從不放棄
They never give up.

511
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:00,040
我們可以好好向他們學習
We can learn a very good lesson from them.

512
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:09,170
同學們，我有重要的事情宣佈
Class, I have an important announcement.

513
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:14,350
從現在起，馬魯格將成為我的助教
From now on, Maruge is going to be my teaching assistant.

514
00:50:14,510 --> 00:50:17,520
幹得好，幹得好，馬魯格
Well done, well done, Maruge.

515
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:19,100
我印象深刻
I'm impressed.

516
00:50:19,280 --> 00:50:21,500
你是怎麼讓他們表現得這麼好的？
How did you get them all to behave so well?

517
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:27,200
我告訴他們，如果他們不規矩，我就用棍子打他們
I told them if they didn't behave, I'll clobber them with my stick.

518
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:31,160
馬魯格! Maruge!

519
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:20,800
等等，馬魯格先生來了！
Wait a minute, there's Mr Maruge!

520
00:51:20,950 --> 00:51:22,330
馬魯格先生來了
There's Mr Maruge.

521
00:51:22,500 --> 00:51:24,090
馬魯格先生，馬魯格先生
Mr Maruge, Mr Maruge.

522
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,510
好了，好了! Alright, alright!

523
00:51:31,670 --> 00:51:35,600
拜託，拜託，如果我們接受採訪，至少要有秩序地進行
Please, please, if we're going to do this, let us at least do it in an orderly way.

524
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:39,230
如果你想和馬魯格說話，一次問一個問題
If you want to speak to Maruge, one question at a time.

525
00:51:39,390 --> 00:51:40,770
他的聽力不好 拜託
His hearing is poor. Please.

526
00:51:40,930 --> 00:51:42,310
馬魯格先生，我是CNN華盛頓的記者
Mr Maruge, CNN Washington.

527
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,940
馬魯格先生，為什麼你年輕的時候不去上學呢?
Mr Maruge, why didn't you go to school when you were younger?

528
00:51:45,100 --> 00:51:48,030
當馬魯格小時候，黑人沒有免費教育
There was no free education for black people when Maruge was a boy.

529
00:51:48,190 --> 00:51:50,030
那現在上學的動機是什麼
What is the motivation now'?

530
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,750
他說什麼?
What did he say?

531
00:52:03,910 --> 00:52:07,130
他說，"筆中自有力量"
He says, the power is in the pen.

532
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:12,340
讀書是非常重要的
To read is very important.

533
00:52:12,510 --> 00:52:15,980
這是我們脫貧的途徑之一
This is one way of finishing poverty among us.

534
00:52:17,140 --> 00:52:21,020
還有聖經  我不相信教堂的傳教士
And the Bible. I don't trust those preachers in the churches.

535
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:21,920
誰會？Who does?

536
00:52:22,220 --> 00:52:23,600
馬魯格先生，我是BBC倫敦的記者
Mr Maruge, BBC London.

537
00:52:23,770 --> 00:52:26,900
肯尼亞政府在這個國家的教育方面做得夠多了嗎？
Is the Kenyan Government doing enough for education in this country?

538
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:30,320
是的，是的，免費教育！對於所有人
Yes, yes, free education! For all.

539
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,320
馬魯格先生，我是NTV奈洛比的記者
Mr Maruge, NTV Nairobi.

540
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:37,740
你覺得這事對嗎?
Do you think this is right?

541
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:41,030
她只是在引起人們對她自己和學校的注意
She's just drawing attention to herself and the school.

542
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,870
這對誰都不好
It's not right for anybody.

543
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:44,500
阿爾佛雷德 Alfred.

544
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:47,830
嘿? Hey?

545
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:50,800
你是我認識的最消極的人
You are the most negative person I know.

546
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:53,460
這對學校來說是件好事 放輕鬆點
This is a good thing for the school. Just relax.

547
00:52:58,430 --> 00:53:02,060
人們，這個世界已經完全瘋了
People, the world has gone absolutely mad.

548
00:53:02,220 --> 00:53:05,350
並且看看，《紐約時報》《洛杉磯時報》《肯尼亞時報》
And look, 'New York Times', 'L.A. Times', 'Kenya Times',

549
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,640
所有的"時報"
all the 'Times',

550
00:53:06,810 --> 00:53:08,860
BBC，《每日電訊報》
BBC, 'Daily Telegraph'.

551
00:53:09,020 --> 00:53:12,820
整個世界都在說，馬魯格，馬魯格!
The world is finally talking, Maruge, Maruge!

552
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:17,580
還有那個讓84歲的馬魯格入學的老師
And not to forget the teacher who took Maruge to school at 84 years.

553
00:53:17,740 --> 00:53:19,540
全瘋了!
It's absolutely crazy!

554
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:24,500
現在，這個老人曾經是茅茅黨的退伍軍人，戰士
Now, this mzee was once a Mau Mau veteran, war fighter,

555
00:53:24,660 --> 00:53:26,210
他想讓肯尼亞說...
who wanted Kenya to say...

556
00:53:29,290 --> 00:53:30,420
"能" 'Can'.

557
00:53:30,580 --> 00:53:34,010
現在，儘管他已經上了年紀，但他也在要求免費教育
Now, despite his age, he too is demanding free education

558
00:53:34,170 --> 00:53:38,100
而且校長珍妮·歐賓舒把他迎進了學校
and head teacher Jane Obinchu has welcomed him through the doors.

559
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:39,630
許多家長感到憤怒
Many parents are outraged

560
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,600
而且覺得這樣一個寶貴的地方不應該浪費在
and feel that such a valuable place should not be wasted

561
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:44,480
這樣一個老人身上
on such an old man.

562
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:46,690
而且，隨著情緒越來越高漲
And, as feelings run increasingly high,

563
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:50,100
毫無疑問，這場爭論將愈演愈烈
this controversy is no doubt set to grow.

564
00:53:59,150 --> 00:54:00,950
哈巴麗·雅可?
Habari yako?

565
00:54:01,750 --> 00:54:02,950
別跟我打招呼
Don't say hello to me

566
00:54:04,370 --> 00:54:07,790
你並不關心我們的孩子  你只關心你自己
You don't care about our children. You only care about yourself.

567
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:09,330
你想在報紙上露臉
You want your face in the newspapers

568
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:11,220
這樣你就可以把口袋裝滿錢
so that you can fill your pockets with money.

569
00:54:11,370 --> 00:54:13,170
你竟敢對我這麼說！
How dare you say that to me!

570
00:54:13,330 --> 00:54:16,710
每個孩子對我都很重要，包括你兒子
Every single child is important to me, including your son.

571
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,550
叫哈巴麗·雅可·波羅 對吧? 對
Habari yako, Polo? Mzuri.

572
00:54:20,580 --> 00:54:22,250
請讓開
Please get out of the way

573
00:54:23,440 --> 00:54:25,410
讓開 Get out of the way

574
00:54:33,880 --> 00:54:35,350
這事還沒完呢?
It's not over yet?

575
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:41,000
茅茅黨  你看到了嗎? 那個標題？
Mau Mau have you seen? The title?

576
00:54:41,030 --> 00:54:42,780
你看到了嗎？你看到標題了嗎？
Have you seen that? Have you seen the title?

577
00:54:44,490 --> 00:54:47,290
84歲  84歲
84 years. 84! 84 years.

578
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:48,950
返回學校上學
Gone back to school.

579
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:50,350
你幾歲? 55歲
How old are you? 55.

580
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:52,220
55歲  你是個蹣跚學步的孩子
55. You are a toddler.

581
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:56,840
"84歲茅茅黨老兵最終走進學校"
"The 84 year old Mau Mau party veteran finally entered the school"

582
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:08,850
我可不想我兒子跟一個老頭混在一起！
I don't want my son being mixed with old men!

583
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,610
好的，請大家靜一靜
OK, everybody, please.

584
00:55:10,770 --> 00:55:13,690
我知道你們都很難過
I know that you are all upset.

585
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:17,070
拜託，你們聽我說好嗎?
Please, would you listen to me?

586
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:20,280
我認為我們可以從馬魯格身上學到很多東西
I think that we have a lot to learn from Maruge.

587
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,990
他在幫助我們
He's helping us.

588
00:55:23,150 --> 00:55:26,950
好嗎? 孩子們有很多東西可以向老人學習
OK? The children have a lot that they can learn from the old.

589
00:55:27,120 --> 00:55:29,540
我不想讓他教我兒子，蛤？
I don't want him to teach my son, huh?

590
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:31,420
他算老幾? 他算老幾?
Who is he? Who is he'?

591
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:33,580
老師在哪裡？
Where is the teachers'?

592
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:53,440
現在看看這個 肯定不錯
Now look at this. Surely.

593
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:07,120
你以為你在幹什麼？你在開馬戲團！
What do you think you're doing? You're running a circus!

594
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,250
我叫你擺脫那老頭
I told you to get rid of that old man.

595
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:10,400
你知道嗎? 奇普托先生
You know what, Mr Kipruto?

596
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,660
你為什麼不坦白說出來？
Why don't you just come clean?

597
00:56:11,830 --> 00:56:14,550
是因為馬魯格老了還是因為他是基庫尤人
Is it because Maruge is old or is it because he's Kikuyu

598
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:16,300
你不想讓他在這裡？
that you don't want him here?

599
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,930
這與部落無關，歐賓舒夫人!
This is not about tribes, Mrs Obinchu!

600
00:56:19,090 --> 00:56:21,590
你以為你是誰，指揮議程？
Who do you think you are, dictating the agenda?

601
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:24,510
你只是個員工 你照我說的做
You're an employee. You do as I tell you.

602
00:56:24,670 --> 00:56:27,640
現在，我最後一次警告你 他要去成人學校!
Now, I'm warning you one last time. He goes to the adult school!

603
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:32,520
他沒有錢，奇普托先生  他不能在其他地方上學
He's got no money, Mr Kipruto. He can't go to school anywhere else.

604
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:34,650
他很快就有錢了
He will have money soon.

605
00:56:34,810 --> 00:56:38,360
這個基庫尤政府要給茅茅黨人補償金
This Kikuyu government is going to give the Mau Mau compensation money.

606
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,490
補償什麼?  殺了自己的同胞嗎?
Compensation for what? For killing their own people?

607
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:42,400
奇普托先生...
Mr Kipruto...

608
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:47,570
我們不能把過去拋在腦後嗎？
can't we just put the past behind us?

609
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:50,830
過去始終是存在的，歐賓舒夫人
The past is always present, Mrs Obinchu.

610
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,490
永遠不要忘記這一點
Never forget that.

611
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:17,030
馬魯格 Maruge.

612
00:58:17,520 --> 00:58:19,700
我懷孕了
I'm pregnant

613
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:54,490
問她，問問她，這是不是她的丈夫?
Ask her. Ask her, is this her husband?

614
00:58:57,580 --> 00:58:59,700
問她，基庫尤人?
Ask her, Kikuyu?

615
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:15,430
把孩子從她身上抱走
Take the child off her.

616
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,440
把這個孩子從她身上抱走
Take this baby off her.

617
01:00:37,190 --> 01:00:38,290
嘿! 卡卯
Hey, Kamau.

618
01:00:38,290 --> 01:00:41,730
我來教你寫"5"字
Let me teach you to write "5"

619
01:00:41,760 --> 01:00:44,960
老頭你連鉛筆都削不了
Old man, you can't even sharpen a pencil

620
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,400
你怎麼這麼沒禮貌
Why are you so rude

621
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:03,170
看 看看他的成績
Look. Look at his grades.

622
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:04,820
他趕不上其他同學
He can't keep up with the others.

623
01:01:04,840 --> 01:01:06,340
你是說我兒子笨嗎?
Meaning that my son is stupid?

624
01:01:06,370 --> 01:01:08,290
我沒說你兒子笨，切格先生
I'm not saying that your son is stupid, Mr Chege.

625
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:09,930
我想說的是在我們學校
All I'm saying is that in our school

626
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:12,120
他的學習要達到一定的成就水準
there's a certain level of attainment that he needs to achieve

627
01:01:12,280 --> 01:01:13,990
以便進入下一課
in order to move on to the next class.

628
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:16,440
否則，他要留級或者去特殊學校
Otherwise, he repeats the same class or goes to special school.

629
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:24,080
我兒子有權享受免費教育!
My son has a right for free education!

630
01:01:24,250 --> 01:01:25,630
聽清楚了嗎?
Do I make myself clear?

631
01:01:25,790 --> 01:01:27,170
我完全理解，切格先生
I understand perfectly, Mr Chege.

632
01:01:27,340 --> 01:01:28,840
我們盡所能去幫他
We're helping him in every way we can.

633
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:30,380
你們根本沒幫他! 蛤?
You are not helping him! Huh?

634
01:01:30,550 --> 01:01:33,270
你在忙著和那個愚蠢的老頭子浪費時間
You're busy wasting your time with that stupid old man.

635
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:34,800
聽著，我在開一家商店，蛤？
Look, I'm running a shop, huh?

636
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:37,560
而我兒子的數學和科學一定非常好
And my son must be extremely good in mathematics and science.

637
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:46,710
這是不公平的，而且這是不對的！
This is not fair and this is not right!

638
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:48,150
切格先生，我...
Mr Chege, I...

639
01:01:48,890 --> 01:01:51,940
你回家後我們會處理的
We'll deal with this when you get home.

640
01:02:02,870 --> 01:02:06,170
噢，我想我們知道他會跳舞 他在教室媢L得怎麼樣？
Well, I guess we know he can dance. How's he getting on in the classroom?

641
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:09,050
他的數學很好，不過他真正的目的是來識字的
His maths is good, but he really came here to read,

642
01:02:09,210 --> 01:02:10,590
這需要做更多的工作
and it needs a lot more work.

643
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:13,720
這是關於為每個人找時間
It's about finding time for everyone.

644
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:16,300
來，來，來 回到課堂上！

哦，馬魯格，你做得太好了
Oh, Maruge, you have done so well.

662
01:03:05,100 --> 01:03:06,480

"啊"  "巴"  "卡"  "答"...
'Ah', 'buh', 'kuh', 'duh'...

666
01:03:43,390 --> 01:03:45,390
喂? 是珍妮·歐賓舒嗎?
Hello? Jane Obinchu?

667
01:03:45,560 --> 01:03:46,930
是的? Yes?

668
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:49,820
所以現在你給那老頭單獨授課，是嗎？
So now you are giving private lessons to the old man, eh?

669
01:03:51,560 --> 01:03:52,940
這是誰？Who is this?

670
01:03:53,110 --> 01:03:55,280

Walalaa! Hoo, hoo, hoo. Wa wa wa wa!

674
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:20,050
現在，這就是所謂的輪子上的錢移動貨幣
Now, that's called money on wheels mobile money.

675
01:04:20,220 --> 01:04:22,390
政客們現在想要什麼？
Politicians what do they want now?

676
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:25,150
當我長大後，我喜歡開那種車

677
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:26,770

他們正在向教室扔血淋淋的石頭

你在指責我什麼嗎？

01:15:22,460 --> 01:15:25,140
那你願意承受這些多久，珍?
How far are you willing to take this, Jane?

825
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:28,720
你為什麼要為了這個老頭冒一切風險？

826
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:32,430
讓它去吧! Just let it go.

827
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:34,310
讓它去吧! Let it go.

828
01:15:39,270 --> 01:15:41,400
查爾斯，你知道簡單的答案是什麼嗎？
You know what the simple answer is, Charles?

829
01:15:43,610 --> 01:15:46,780
我就是沒法將他拒之門外
I just don't have any way to turn him away.

830
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:53,250
我會去圖爾卡納

圖爾卡納很遠
Turkana is far.

840
01:16:39,960 --> 01:16:41,880
你丈夫打算怎麼辦?
What about your husband?

他會留在奈洛比

842
01:16:45,880 --> 01:16:47,250
他很忙 He's very busy.

我們已經分開很久了，我們已經習慣了，是嗎？

我想我太老了學不了什麼東西

他不是一個受過教育的人
He wasn't an educated man.

他是個漁夫
He was a fisherman.

851
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:16,160

852
01:17:16,320 --> 01:17:21,080
"學習永遠不會結束，直到你踏進棺材"

01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:31,650
"珍妮，你一定熱愛教育"

866
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:34,740
"因為我要你比我更優秀"

Hey, what's that? You're an idiot for going back to school.
