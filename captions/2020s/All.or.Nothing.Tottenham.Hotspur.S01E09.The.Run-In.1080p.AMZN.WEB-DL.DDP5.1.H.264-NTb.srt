第九集  冲突
EPISODE 9 THE RUN-IN

1
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,600
有一些品质，如果缺少的话，你很难赢得比赛
There are a few qualities that, without them, you just can’t win.

2
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,720
其中最需要花时间培养的就是心理素质
The one that takes more time to develop is the psychological profile,

3
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,200
作为一个集体去比赛的精气神
that collective state of mind.

4
00:00:22,280 --> 00:00:25,680
这帮小伙子现在最缺的就是这个
I think that is something that they really need to improve.

5
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:27,960
行了
OK.

6
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,360
我们来谈谈下一场比赛
Let’s move to the next game.

7
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:33,400
从防守端来说
By the defensive point of view,

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,440
咱就保持一贯的作风
we want to keep the same principles,

9
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:42,280
但是咱们得往前提20米
but we need to do it 20 metres more in front.

10
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:47,800
所有人，锋线、中场、后防线都得往前提
Everybody, strikers, midfielders, defensive line bring it up.

11
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,120
人家铁定摆我们大巴，所以说会很难踢，很难
They are very defensive, so difficult match... difficult match.

12
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,880
咱们还有八场比赛要踢
So, eight matches to play.

13
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:02,560
如果出于某种原因，我们没法拿到积分榜第五
If for some reason, we don’t manage to get that fifth position,

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,480
虽然我是觉得没啥可能，但是万一失足
which I think we can, there is still the position

15
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,520
咱还有欧联，如果我们去踢欧联杯
of Europa League. If we play Europa League,

16
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,760
咱也还有机会能赢，总之比啥都没有强，所以说
maybe we win it, maybe it’s better than not to play so...

17
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,120
接下来还是得去争取
We still have fights in there.

18
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:22,920
积分榜第五跟第六已经近在咫尺了
Fifth is there and for the sixth is there.

19
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,280
咱再冲一把
Here we go.

20
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,600
托特纳姆热刺的新时代到来了
A new era begins for Tottenham Hotspur.

21
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:32,280
最重要的东西是
The most important thing...

22
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,360
勇气
Courage.

23
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,280
忠诚
Honesty.

24
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,160
亲如家人
Family.

25
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,320
聆听来自托特纳姆热刺球场的山呼海啸吧
Listen to Tottenham Hotspur's Stadium now.

26
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,240
小伙子们，冲起来！干他丫的！
Let’s go together, boys. Come on!

27
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,160
好，开始吧，球在那
OK, let’s go! Balls there.

28
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,040
两天后，热刺将与西汉姆联展开伦敦德比大战
In two days time, Tottenham Hotspur will face West Ham in a London derby.

29
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,960
两队的上一次交手恰逢穆帅的首秀
The two sides last met in José Mourinho’s first game as Head Coach.

30
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,520
我能感受到些许的不同
I can feel little differences,

31
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,000
这是个过程，我们在慢慢变化
it’s a process, I say that we are changing.

32
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,400
这个过程需要时间
It’s a process that takes time.

33
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:28,400
我督促他们形成这种责任感
I push them for... for this sense of responsibility.

34
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,040
对球迷的责任感，还有对俱乐部的责任感
Responsibility to the fans, to the club.

35
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,120
这非常非常重要。我觉得…
It’s something very, very important. I think it’s...

36
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,000
这一定程度上决定了球队是否更加具有竞争力
it's part of a certain package that makes a team more or less competitive.

37
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,560
热刺本赛季还有八场比赛
Spurs have eight matches remaining this season.

38
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:48,080
他们目前排名联赛第八，距离第五还差四分
They currently sit in eighth, four points off fifth position,

39
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,960
而第五就足以可能让热刺挺进下赛季的欧冠
which could be enough to secure Champions League football

40
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:53,600
如果曼城的禁令维持原判
if Manchester City’s ban remains in place.

41
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,560
我觉得这是一场极度重要的比赛
I think this is a desperately important game.

42
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:10,080
热刺已经连续七场不胜了
Spurs are winless in seven games.

43
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,240
我仍然认为第五还是有希望的
I still think fifth is certainly feasible.

44
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,320
我们需要赢下今晚这场比赛
We need to win this game tonight.

45
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,160
伦敦德比！伙计们！
London derby lads, alright?

46
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,240
加油！加油兄弟们！
Come on, come on, boys!

47
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,880
一场首都德比战已然打响
A derby in the capital is up and running.

48
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,920
被绍切克抢断
Just cut out by Soucek.

49
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,920
洛塞尔索，拿住球
Take the ball, Gio.

50
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,720
软趴趴的跟坨翔一样！
It’s too flat this shit.

51
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,080
鲍文
Bowen...

52
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:50,280
一路火花带闪电交给插上的费雷德里克斯
Electric play brings Fredericks into it.

53
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:53,520
福纳尔斯在中苏，安东尼奥在后点包抄
Fornals is in the middle, Antonio’s round the back post...

54
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,600
上啊，埃里克森！
Come on, Eric!

55
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,680
洛塞尔索拿回球权
Lo Celso retrieves it.

56
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:59,560
好球！孙哥位置不错！
Good ball...Son in a really good area...

57
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,600
孙兴慜为热刺首开纪录
And Heung-min Son has fired Spurs ahead.

58
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,240
但我估计这球不算，看起来孙兴慜好像越位了
But I do not think this will stand, it looks like Son is offside.

59
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,520
进球无效
And it is not a goal.

60
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,440
进入中场休息
Half time.

61
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
好，开始吧
OK, let's go.

62
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,240
如果有人
If any one of you

63
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,640
感觉有点累
feels a little bit of fatigue,

64
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,360
想想你们休息了三天，他们只有两天休息
you had three days to rest, they have two days to rest.

65
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:41,000
我不觉得这是累，我不觉得
I don’t think it's fatigue, I don’t think it is.

66
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:49,200
如果你们需要点压力才能踢好
If you need a little bit of pressure to be better,

67
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:52,760
那我就来给你们点实实在在的压力
I give you an honest little bit of pressure.

68
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,800
如果咱们这场赢不下来，咱就完犊子了
I think if we don’t win the game, it’s over.

69
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,040
整个歇逼
It’s over.

70
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,520
什么第四也好，第五也罢
Forget fourth, forget fifth,

71
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,600
想都别想
it’s over.

72
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:06,360
我们今儿的这些雄心壮志，人一脚就能给我们踢飞了
Our ambitions today, they can finish.

73
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:09,160
然后我们还得再踢一个月
And then we are going to have one more month

74
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:14,560
嘴里含着一口屎再踢七场
with seven more matches to, uh, to... to play with a shit feeling.

75
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,600
你们得再加把劲儿
You have to give more.

76
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,160
得再拼的狠一点
You have to give more.

77
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:25,040
你们还能再精进的地方我能说一千个
I can tell you one thousand details where you have to give more.

78
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,720
咱现在最大的问题是
Our biggest problem is one...

79
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:35,160
瞎几把传然后把球丢了
missing shit passes.

80
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,160
又他妈软，又他妈慢，该往前送的时候在那回传
Fucking sloppy, fucking slow, pass back when the pass should be in front.

81
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,480
瞎他妈传
It's sloppy.

82
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:48,040
第二个问题是不够紧张
The second thing is about intensity.

83
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,320
你们要么是责任感不够强  要么就是动力不足
It’s about your responsibility or your own motivation.

84
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,960
这话我们踢第一场比赛之前我就说过
The game, I told this before we start playing the first game,

85
00:05:57,040 --> 00:06:02,640
我早就说，你们老是踢完了才意识到比赛有多重要
I told you, you only have the feeling that the game was important in the end,

86
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,440
等比完了你们回到这里
and in the end of the game you are going to be here.

86
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,140
开始在那阿巴阿巴阿巴阿巴
Abababiya, abababa, abababa, abababa

87
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,200
大鼻涕流到嘴里知道甩了，踢的时候去干屁了
It’s not after the game, it’s during the game.

88
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,000
踢比赛的时候就给我想着：每一场比赛都非常重要，操！
It’s during the game. The game is important, fuck!

89
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:17,920
听到没有啊！
Hey!

90
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,920
- 上啊兄弟们！   - 操他们大爷的！
- Come on then lads, hey! - Fucking hell!

91
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,720
都他妈的醒醒！跟他们死磕到底！
Wake up hey, come on! Push!

92
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,200
加油兄弟们！跟他们干！
Come on then, let's go!

93
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,240
北伦敦的这场对决继续进行
We're back up and running in North London.

94
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,200
戴尔拿球，持续推进
It’s into Dier, stepping forward here,

95
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,240
埃里克·戴尔有机会！
Eric Dier into a good area.

96
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,360
逼抢！
Push!

97
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,320
传给德勒·阿里…
To Dele Alli...

98
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,560
凯恩打门！
Kane fires for goal!

99
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:46,360
加油！上啊小孙！加油小孙！
Come on, come on Sonny, come on Sonny!

100
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,520
孙兴慜，全场最快的球员之一，分边给到洛塞尔索
Son, one of the quickest players on the pitch, moves it out to Lo Celso.

101
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,080
凯恩就位了，打门！
Kane is there...Kane is in...

102
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,680
凯恩的射门稍稍偏出
And Kane has fired wide.

103
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,120
奥里耶传中
Aurier hangs it in.

104
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,280
巴尔武埃纳将球顶出，角球
And Balbuena nodding it behind for a corner.

105
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,920
噢，球被撞入了球门
Oh, and it’s scrambled in.

106
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,120
托特纳姆热刺首开纪录！
Tottenham Hotspur have the lead,

107
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,240
皮球碰到了一名西汉姆联球员折射
flicking off a West Ham player.

108
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,920
热刺向前推进，凯恩并不越位
Spurs looking to move on here and Kane is onside,

109
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,040
边裁没有举旗， 凯恩将比分改写为2-0
the flag has stayed down for Harry Kane to make it two-nil.

110
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:29,160
冷静的一锤定音
An outstandingly cool finish

111
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,760
来自凯恩在热刺的第200场英超比赛
from Harry Kane in his 200th Premier League appearance for Spurs.

112
00:07:35,760 --> 00:07:39,240
这粒进球也为热刺锁定一场关键的胜利
And it wrapped up a big win for Tottenham Hotspur.

113
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,800
牛逼啊兄弟们！
Come on boys!

114
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:46,960
抱歉我想问一个今天没有出场的球员
Sorry to ask you about a player who didn’t play,

115
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,680
尤其是你今天还取得了胜利
especially after you’ve just come away with a victory,

116
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:51,280
但是我注意到汤基·恩东贝莱
but I noticed Tanguy Ndombele

117
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,120
今晚的比赛中压根都没有热身过
didn’t warm up at all tonight during the match.

118
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:57,400
一分钟都没上，你俩的关系还好吗？
Has Tanguy been okay with you not getting any minutes?

119
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:00,960
我没办法一场比赛首发12个或者13个球员
I cannot start a game with 12 or 13 players.

120
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,760
我尽力为球队作出最好的选择
I try to do the best for the team.

121
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,440
就，你知道
Uh... You know,

122
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,760
有时候我得向不是我第一选择的球员道歉
sometimes I apologise to my players that are not my first choice,

123
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,920
但是我得尽力做好我的工作
but I have to do my job the best I... the best I can.

124
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,600
- 好的，非常感谢大家  - 谢谢
- Right guys, thank you very much. - Thank you.

125
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,520
顶着6000万欧元的身价
At a reported 60 million euros,

126
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,520
汤基·恩东贝莱是热刺队史最高身价
Tanguy Ndombele is the most expensive player in Tottenham’s history.

127
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:29,520
转会费金额巨大，是一笔超级签约
The fee is huge, it’s a mega signing.

128
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:32,160
就像是董事会展示雄心所摆出的态度
It is a statement of intent from the Board.

129
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,640
这位23岁的法国人到来之后取得了一个梦幻开局
The 23-year-old Frenchman made an impressive start at the club,

130
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,040
首秀即进球
scoring on his debut.

131
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,840
汤基·恩东贝莱！立竿见影的效果！
Tanguy Ndombele, what an impact!

132
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:48,400
但自从首秀之后，汤基就饱受伤病困扰
But since then, Tanguy has struggled with injuries

133
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,880
也逐渐失去了常规首发地位
and has failed to establish a regular first team place.

134
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,760
其他队友都在帮助他适应伦敦的生活
Other members of the squad have been helping him adapt to life in London.

135
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:03,480
他和同胞，法国国脚穆萨·西索科的关系尤为亲密
He has built a bond with fellow French international, Moussa Sissoko.

136
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:07,480
汤基跟我属于是，他就像我的小老弟一样
My relationship with Tanguy is, he is like my little brother

137
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,520
我尽可能帮他
and uh, I try to help him.

138
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,720
作为一个球员，每场比赛你都想踢
When you’re a player you want to play every game,

139
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:15,360
想要享受足球，做好自己的工作
try to enjoy, try to do your job.

140
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:18,760
所以每当你进不了大名单
So when you are not being picking in the team

141
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,360
只是在训练，你能感觉到少了点什么
but just only training you can feel something is missing

142
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,360
这种感觉非常痛苦
and, uh, it’s very painful.

143
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,000
我完全可以理解这种感觉，因为我也经历过
I can understand because I've been in that situation

144
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,600
我知道的…这种感觉不好受
and I know it's... it's not a good feeling

145
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,720
有时候你回到家，满脑子还是在想着这个事
so even when you go back home you are still thinking about it.

146
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,840
穆萨，调酒大师
Moussa, the barman.

147
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,600
怎么样，味道不错吧
They’re good, aren’t they?

148
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,280
这个酱料不错，带一点点辣
I like the sauce, it’s a bit spicy.

149
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,760
有点像贝涅饼（一种法式传统油炸面团）
It’s kind of like beignets.

150
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,640
热着好吃，等凉了你要是再热一下
When they’re warm I like it, but when they’re cold and you reheat them,

151
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,080
那就是两种味了，感觉不一样的
it’s not the same eh, It’s another sensation.

152
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,760
还有这个酱饭（科特迪瓦传统美食）
And ‘Riz couché.’

153
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:54,720
对，就叫“Riz couché”，隔夜饭拌一拌
‘Riz couché, ’ that’s the thing, rice that has slept.

154
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,280
你第一个赛季感觉怎么样
Your first season, how's it been?

155
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,640
怎么说呢
What can I say?

156
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,000
一言难尽，我老是受伤
It’s been complicated, I was injured a lot.

157
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,520
还在过渡期适应比赛
It’s been a season of adaptation.

158
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,280
不过也还行，哥几个一直都在帮我
But it’s been OK, you guys have been there to help me.

159
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,760
你觉得适应起来哪方面会比较困难？
Why did you think it was difficult to settle in?

160
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,880
生活在异国他乡很复杂的
It’s complicated when you change country.

161
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,600
我离开法国
I left France,

162
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,960
离开我的家人来到这里
and I left my family to come here.

163
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,600
环境改变之后终归不是那么简单的
Then it’s not easy when you change environment.

164
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,600
训练的强度变大了，比赛更是
The training, it's a change in intensity, and even the matches.

165
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,320
人得学着适应新生活
You have to adapt to a new life,

166
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:42,760
到目前为止并不容易，但是慢慢来吧
and it hasn’t been easy so far but that’s how it is.

167
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,520
你知道，队伍里有20，25个球员
You know in the squad we are twenty, twenty five players, so,

168
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,520
所以不是每个球员都能一直上场的，这很正常，但是
so, of course, everyone cannot be on the pitch every time but you need to...

169
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:57,600
你得保持专注，努力做好本职工作，每天都试着进步一点点
to stay focused, try to do your job and try to improve every day,

170
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:00,800
我一直就是这么过来的
so that’s what I’ve tried to do and...

171
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,200
即使有时候很艰难，我也能保持耐心
I was patient even if sometime was hard,

172
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,880
一步一步来，最后进入首发十一人名单，所以说
and step by step I could make my place in the starting eleven, so...

173
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,960
困难的时候想要放弃是很轻松的
'Cause you know it’s easy to give up when it’s tough,

174
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,000
不仅是足球，生活里也是一样
not even in football but in the life.

175
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,000
人生就是一场阅历，对吧？
The life is experience, no?

176
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:23,600
最好的办法就是，你每天的努力都让自己满意
The best way to work, when you are happy with what you give,

177
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,720
训练的每一天都倾尽全力
uh, everyday in the training,

178
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:31,800
你懂的，剩下的就是等待时机的到来
you know, yeah, you need to wait the right moment.

179
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,920
教练做决定的时候，咱们得学会接受
When the manager is making some choice and... we need to accept that

180
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,920
即使有时候是痛苦的
even if sometime it’s painful.

181
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,760
不过汤基明年就能带咱们挺进欧冠
But Tanguy will bring us to the Champions League next year.

182
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,680
没错，我们都相信他
Yeah, we believe on him.

183
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,000
你为什么想当球员？
Why did you want to become a footballer?

184
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,360
因为，我喜欢足球
Because, uh, I love football.

185
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,320
After speaking with José,
和魔力鸟谈过之后

186
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,960
主席列维把他的转会标王叫来开了个会
chairman Daniel Levy calls a meeting with his record signing

187
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,000
来讨论他上场时间不够的问题
to discuss his lack of playing time.

188
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,640
我总是说，转会这个事儿
I always say to people when it comes to transfers

189
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:12,760
你是在跟不同的球员打交道，他们来自五湖四海不同的俱乐部
you're dealing with human beings, they're in a different club,

190
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:15,560
拥有不同的文化，你没办法完全保证
a different culture and there's absolutely no guarantee

191
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,200
每个人在我们这也能玩得转
that they’ll work in this club.

192
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:21,240
有时候也需要一点运气，正确的判断，还有很多细致的工作
We need a little bit of luck, some good judgement and a lot of hard work.

193
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:24,360
来啦伙计，就是这儿
Ah voila, it’s here my friend. Here it is.

194
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,840
列维让球员联络官罗伯托·巴尔邦廷加入讨论
He’s asked player liaison officer Roberto Balbontin to join them.

195
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,040
他来了，还有两分钟马上到
He’s coming. He’ll be here in two minutes.

196
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,920
罗伯托会说四种语言
Roberto speaks four languages,

197
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,920
非常擅长帮助球员适应新俱乐部
and specialises in helping players settle at the club.

198
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,240
对于汤基来说，转会而来是个艰难的转变
For Tanguy, it’s been a difficult transition for him.

199
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:43,840
- 嘿，丹尼尔  - 嘿
- Hey, Daniel. - Hi.

200
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,680
通常来说，球员需要6-8个月来适应新环境
Normally, it takes about six months to eight months for someone to settle in

201
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,520
但是具体来说因人而异
but everybody is different.

202
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,680
好嘞，那么…
OK, so...

203
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:58,880
来跟我说说，到底是哪里出了问题
tell me, give me the story of what’s... what’s not working.

204
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:01,800
你在我们这有哪些不适应的
What doesn’t work for you here with us?

205
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,480
过去的三个月我都在很努力的训练
For three months I trained hard.

206
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,440
大家都说我训练表现的非常好
Everybody says I trained really well,

207
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,840
但我依然上不了场，意味着还有别的问题
but if I don’t play it means there must be something else.

208
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:13,680
大多数球员，奔赴海外踢球的第一个赛季
Many players, in their first season coming from overseas,

209
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,760
都很艰难，这很正常
found it difficult and it is normal.

210
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,960
你所经历的事情没啥大不了的
The experiences that you’ve had are normal.

211
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:26,080
穆萨，你俩熟得很，这小子刚来的时候
Moussa, obviously, he knows Moussa well, he came to Tottenham

212
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,160
表现的也是一塌糊涂
and was very disappointing in the early period

213
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:34,720
但是我跟他说，我知道你能表现的更好
and I said to him, "I know you are a better player than you are showing

214
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,280
但是你得决定你脑子里想的是什么
but you have to decide where... what’s in your head."

215
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:43,120
穆萨有一点很好的是，这小子天生争强好斗
The nice thing about Moussa, Moussa is an absolute fighter.

216
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:47,040
他并不打算离开这家俱乐部
He was not prepared to leave the club.

217
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,360
我确实专注度不够
I’m not concentrating as I should be.

218
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:50,960
没拿出满分的状态
I am not 100%.

219
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,480
我16岁那会儿，还在上学的时候
When I was at school, when I was 16, OK?

220
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,040
有一次家长会
My... at a parents' evening,

221
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,960
我班主任跟我爸妈说
um, my headteacher told my parents

222
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,720
我应该退学了
I should leave school.

223
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,200
第二天，我跟自己说，“他大爷的，我不能就这么认输了”
The next day, I said to myself, "I am not going to be beaten."

224
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:08,880
然后从那一天起
and from that moment onwards,

225
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,200
我门门考试一路得A，顺利考上大学
I got "A" s in my exams and I went to university.

226
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,960
我是个斗士
I am a fighter.

227
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,880
我也是个都是，我一直都在拼搏
I’m a fighter, I’ve always fought.

228
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,160
我今天能在这里都是我拼来的
I'm here today because I fought.

229
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,960
无论是踢球还是生活我都没放弃过
I have never given up in football or in life.

230
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:26,120
俱乐部，包括教练
We the club, and the manager,

231
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,640
我们都对他的天赋深信不疑
we both believe he has the talent.

232
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:34,240
只有他自己才能解锁自己的天赋，扭转局面
He has to unlock it, only he can turn that around.

233
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:39,200
汤基，就像他说的，你得靠自己挺过这一关
Like he said, Tanguy, it’s for you to overcome this thing.

234
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,160
他来自法国的体系，所有东西都得重新学
It’s all learning because he’s come from a system in France

235
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,520
那个体系他很熟
where he knew everything.

236
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,000
不能指望球员来了就能形成即战力，即来即用
You can’t expect people to just kind of like plonk them in somewhere and go,

237
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,480
“你要啥有啥，开干吧”
"Go on you’ve got all the tools, get on with it."

238
00:14:51,560 --> 00:14:52,880
人不是机器，不是这么来的
It doesn’t work like that.

239
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:55,400
第一年总是很复杂的，我的朋友
The first year is very complicated, my friend.

240
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:58,880
当你迈过这道坎，前面就是未来，身后的都是过往
Put a line under it. This is the future, that is the past

241
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,200
抬头向前看吧
and look ahead.

242
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,560
OK，行，谢谢啦
OK alright, thank you.

243
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,360
我觉得穆萨这样的人
I think having someone like Moussa,

244
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,800
他是我共事过最温和的球员
he's one of the kindest players I work with,

245
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:14,880
穆萨从被从球迷所嘲笑，到成为球队的大腿
Moussa went from derided by fans, to one of the top players at the club.

246
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:19,160
汤基在经历同样的过程，他最终也会变成大腿的，只是需要一些时间
Tanguy is on that process and he’ll get there, it just takes time.

247
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,920
打门！射！
Finish, finish!

248
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,720
热刺的下一场比赛，是客场挑战谢菲联的一场硬仗
Next up for Tottenham, is a difficult away fixture at Sheffield United.

249
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:50,360
明天就是汤基·恩东贝莱转会一周年了
Tomorrow is the first anniversary since the signing of Tanguy Ndombele,

250
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,320
客观来说这笔转会目前来说还不可谓成功
I think it’s fair to say the move probably hasn’t yet worked out.

251
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,800
还要怎么做他本人才能发挥出来呢
What needs to happen and what does he have to do?

252
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,120
能不能给我们讲讲他的性格，换句话说，他是一个自省的人吗？
Just give us an insight into his mentality and, in other words, is he self critical?

253
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,680
这个问题不应该问我，你们应该问他
That’s not a question for me, that’s a question for him.

254
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:09,640
一个球员要是没有天赋，那屁用没有
Nothing happens when the players have no talent.

255
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,920
但是一旦有点天赋，很多事情都会不一样的
When you have talent, lots of things can... can change

256
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,200
一切皆有可能
and lots of things can... can happen.

257
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:22,280
赛前两队在积分榜上只差一分
Going into the match, just one point separates the two sides.

258
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,720
这场比赛热刺必须拿下，如果他们
It’s a must win game if Spurs are to keep pace

259
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,920
还想继续竞争下赛季的欧冠席位的话
with the other Champions League contenders.

260
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,480
谢菲尔德联1，托特纳姆热刺0
Sheffield United one, Tottenham Hotspur nil.

261
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,320
大家一起上啊！冲啊！
Let's go, come on, come on!!

262
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,840
热刺试图迅速给予反击
Spurs looking to respond swiftly.

263
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,920
小卢卡斯·莫拉在中路突破
Lucas Moura breaking through the middle of the pitch,

264
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,440
他好像被踢到了，哈里·凯恩拿到球…
I think he was caught there. Spurs will play on...

265
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:58,520
热刺还在进攻
through Harry Kane.

266
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,800
噢！来自凯恩的华丽一击！
Oh, it’s majestic from Kane,

267
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,280
其他人还在看裁判的反应，仓促地跑过去试图给予裁判压力
with others looking at the referee and scrambling to get back defensively.

268
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:09,640
VAR正在检查是否存在手球
Well, they are checking this for hand ball,

269
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,000
这未免也有点太过严苛了
that would be exceptionally harsh you feel.

270
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,640
进球被取消了吗？
Has this been ruled out?

271
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,880
看样子是取消了，球好像碰到了卢卡斯·莫拉的手臂
Looks like it has, they’re saying this has hit the arm of Lucas Moura.

272
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,920
进球无效，比分维持1-0
Goal disallowed, it stays one-nil.

273
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:30,280
你可以看到热刺球员难以置信的表情
You can see the disbelief from the Tottenham players,

274
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:32,080
这是怎么给吹掉的
how can that not be given?

275
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:34,520
未免有点太严格了
It is very, very harsh.

276
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,320
精神点，小伙子们！打起精神来！
Liven up, boys! Come on!

277
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:42,400
你们他妈的在训练场的拼劲呢！来这梦游来了！
You are more intense in the fucking training session than in here.

278
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,920
行，那是进球，行，裁判是个瞎子
OK, was a goal. OK, it’s a disgrace.

279
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,960
被判定无效简直是他妈奇耻大辱，那又怎样呢
OK, it’s a fucking big disgrace that this is not a goal,

280
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,960
现实就是，你们还得接着踢
but the reality is the game is there.

281
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,200
热刺需要在下半场展开攻势
Spurs need a massive second half here.

282
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:01,520
现在我们0-1输人家一个，我们得防守
So we are losing one-zero and we have to defend,

283
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,880
如果你们继续梦游，如果防守不够给力
if we lose concentration, if we don’t defend

284
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,320
人家进咱们第二个如探囊取物
they score a second goal.

285
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,280
淦他马勒戈壁的！
Fucking hell!

286
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,320
德勒·阿里和汤基·恩东贝莱准备好上场了
Dele Alli and Tanguy Ndombele are being prepared.

287
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:19,640
如果你的当家转会标王踢不上比赛
It is always going to be a big talking point

288
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:22,080
一定会成为大家讨论的热点的
when your record signing isn’t playing matches.

289
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,880
列维肯定要跟穆里尼奥说
And obviously Daniel Levy is going to be saying to him,

290
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,160
“大哥，6500万大洋啊大哥，你给我好好用起来啊”
"Sixty-five million quid, José, you know, get a tune out of him."

291
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:33,160
恩东贝莱，漂亮
Ndombele, nicely done.

292
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:34,640
拉梅拉…
Lamela...

293
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,800
过顶球倒找孙兴慜，后者成功回传到门前
can hang it round the back for Son, who does cut it back successfully

294
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,280
哈里·凯恩打进了！
and Harry Kane has got his goal.

295
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:46,080
凯恩在伤停补时阶段的进球并没有给热刺带来多大的安慰
Harry Kane’s injury time goal provides Spurs with little consolation.

296
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,040
比赛结束了
And the game is over.

297
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,000
这场失利使得热刺的欧冠梦疑云密布
This defeat puts a massive dent in their Champions League hopes.

298
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:59,200
- 艰难的一晚，是吧若泽？  - 确实
- Tough night, José? - Yeah.

299
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,680
老实说，我本以为我们可以简单把锅甩在
To be honest, I think it would be very, very easy

300
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,920
迈克尔·奥利弗的判罚问题上
to just speak about Michael Oliver decision,

301
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,640
但是那粒进球的取消不应该杀死我们的
but that goal disallowed cannot kill us.

302
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:16,720
我们有足够的时间，在心理上作为一只团结的队伍给予回应
We had enough time to psychologically react as a team in a different way,

303
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,520
而不是因为一个判罚问题就歇菜
and don’t die with that decision,

304
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:23,320
这口大锅得我们自己来背
and that's the thing I blame ourselves

305
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,280
我们得在精神层面变得更加强大
because we have to be much, much mentally stronger

306
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,080
才能从容面对今天这种场面
to cope with situations like this.

307
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:49,080
比赛踢得非常糟糕，队员的态度也很糟糕，没得洗
The game was really bad. The attitude was really bad, it’s true.

308
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
他们得为此有个交代
They have to give an answer.

309
00:19:56,560 --> 00:19:58,640
每天我都在更加了解我的球员们
Every day I learn more about my players,

310
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:04,240
他们赢球会怎么样，输球会怎么样
what they are winning a match, what they are losing a match,

311
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,080
大败而归又会怎样
what they are after a defeat.

312
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,560
我是个要求很高的人
I am very demanding

313
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,000
嗯…
and, uh...

314
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:18,440
我总是试图把球员推到极限
I try to push players to... to their limits

315
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,080
我也支持球员内部的竞争
and I like to feed that internal competition.

316
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:27,560
输给谢菲联的三天之后
Three days after the defeat against Sheffield United,

317
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:30,080
穆里尼奥决定让球员们分成11对11
José decides that he wants to see his players

318
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:33,160
来一场真刀真枪的队内对抗赛
in an eleven-a-side match against each other.

319
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,520
准备！开始！冲啊！
OK, ready! Go, go, go!

320
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,200
没错！紧逼！
Yes! Push, push!

321
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,200
绕到前面去！塞尔吉！
Go over! Go over, Serge!

322
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,200
加油！
Come on!

323
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,240
嘿！犯规了！
Hey! Hey, it's a foul!

324
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,480
靠老好人是没办法赢下比赛的
You don’t win football matches with nice guys

325
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:53,040
你踏上赛场的时候就得带着这种觉悟
and you have to go to the competition with that spirit.

326
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,880
你还行不？
You, OK?

327
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:02,920
我认为他他在一步步的试图让我们理解
I think step by step he tried to make us understand

328
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,800
他心中对我们期待的踢法
the way he wants us to play.

329
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,480
我觉得他的足球哲学，是以侵略性的踢法为核心的
I think his philosophy is to play football with aggressiveness,

330
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,320
看到他的球员在场上拼尽全力
to see your players giving everything on the pitch,

331
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,320
这比什么的都重要
it’s more important than anything else.

332
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,960
埃里克·戴尔凶狠放铲孙兴慜，导致后者需要接受治疗
A hard tackle by Eric Dier, leaves Heung-min Son needing treatment.

333
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:30,080
随着比赛继续，更紧张的冲突在队内爆发了
And as play continues, more tension breaks out within the squad.

334
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:33,040
你就整天在那叨逼叨，每天都是
You speak a lot, every day you speak a lot,

335
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:38,160
就剩个破嘴，一天天的就他妈知道嘚巴嘚嘚巴嘚嘚巴嘚
you speak a lot every day, every day you speak a lot, every day...

336
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:42,160
可以了！打住！
OK! Stop!

337
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,160
小孙刚刚倒下了
Sonny’s just gone down.

338
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,560
- 啥意思？小孙倒了？  - 不是，他刚刚给铲翻了
- What do you mean gone down? - No, he's just been knocked down, now.

339
00:21:57,720 --> 00:22:00,320
- 他绝逼是故意的，你说是不是？  - 谁？教练吗？
- He's set this up though, ain’t he? - Who, the gaffer?

340
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,200
没错
Yeah.

341
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,600
为了明天的比赛先给他们浇点油是吧
A little bit of nastiness in them for tomorrow?

342
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:04,680
确实
Yeah.

343
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,800
小孙啊，疼得厉害吗？
Sonny, is the pain very bad?

344
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,960
你能感觉到我在摸你的脚后跟不？
Can you feel me touching your heel OK?

345
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:32,080
来东东你的脚趾头，先动动看
Wiggle your toes, wiggle the toes first.

346
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,400
不是肌肉的问题的吧…应该就是前……
It’s not in muscle... it’s in the sh...

347
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:39,000
对的，小腿胫部，但是正好在胫骨旁边了
Yeah, it’s the shin, but it’s down the side of the bone

348
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,040
而且你看，软组织淤青开始慢慢浮现出来了
but also you can see the bruising coming up in the soft tissue underneath there.

349
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,320
为了培养球队，培养一种战术
To develop a team, to develop a style of play,

350
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,720
甚至说磨练一种精神
to develop even a mentality,

351
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,560
一定程度上就得用用这种损招
we need to use the difficult moments

352
00:22:55,240 --> 00:23:00,360
让他们互相逼迫，互相责怪，甚至发生冲突
to push each other, to blame each other, to have confrontation.

353
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:06,160
这种事情发生了，是可以允许发生的，我也喜闻乐见
It happen, can happen and I like it to happen.

354
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,240
感觉还行不？
Feeling OK?

355
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:10,080
- 你他妈的图什么？  - 对不起，兄弟，真的对不起
- Why? - I'm sorry, hey. I'm sorry.

356
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,480
我就整不明白了
I don't get it.

357
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,320
试想一下，我胫骨要是断了怎么整
Imagine, I broke my shin.

358
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,720
受伤是一回事儿，疼一疼没事的
One thing is an injury, another thing is pain.

359
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,760
我们不是备着止痛药的嘛
That’s why we have painkillers.

360
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:28,400
小孙，来拍个照片，放到ins上
Sonny, take a picture, put in Instagram

361
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:32,280
来个标题 “震惊！热刺训练中心竟发生这种事情！”
and say, "This was in the training centre."

362
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,840
我发誓我真的生气了
So angry, I swear.

363
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:45,240
热刺接下来要面对的，是刚刚尝到甜头的埃弗顿
Facing Tottenham next is a resurgent Everton side.

364
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,280
对这场比赛你有多紧张，多兴奋？
How nervous, excited are you for this game?

365
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,840
我们还是没拿出精气神来，没那种赢家的精气神
We haven’t got the mentality, we haven’t got winning mentality.

366
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,240
这个男人是个赢家
This is a man that’s a winner,

367
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:58,480
无论他到哪，他都能为球队注入赢家精神
wherever he’s been, he's managed to instill a winning mentality.

368
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:01,400
怎么换成现在这帮球员，他就玩不转了呢？
Is that not possible, with this group of players he’s got?

369
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,960
小孙持球…
Here’s Son...

370
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:05,000
孙兴慜…
Son...

371
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,720
没传过去
No way through.

372
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,440
对阵谢菲联的比赛之后，他可能有坐下来跟队员们谈过
After the Sheffield United game, he's probably sat them down and said,

373
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:15,560
“兄弟们咱得硬起来啊，咱不只是要比这场强”
"Come on guys we really need, not only to be better than this,

374
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:18,600
“咱得拿出点斗志拿出点激情来”
but we also need to show a bit of fight and a bit of passion

375
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,840
“踢的更富有侵略性一点”
and a bit of aggression

376
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:21,480
“目前来看咱就是个软柿子”
because we are a soft touch."

377
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,120
温崽！果断一点！对！
Winksy, determination, yeah.

378
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,720
凯恩…
Kane...

379
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:30,000
洛塞尔索转身抽射！
Lo Celso on the turn...

380
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,200
漂亮的钻进球网！
And it's ended up in the back of the net.

381
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:40,720
卢卡斯，长传打高了，越过了孙兴慜的头顶
Lucas, with a loose ball over Son's head.

382
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:44,360
小孙没有在回追
Son isn't tracking back.

383
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,880
里查利森有机会…
Richarlison has a pop...

384
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,800
偏出太多了
A massive let off.

385
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,520
雨果·洛里仿佛一只任人宰割的羊羔
Hugo Lloris was left very exposed there.

386
00:24:56,160 --> 00:25:00,640
看样子洛里把矛头指向了孙兴慜
And it looks like he is taking his frustrations out on Heung-min Son

387
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,320
冲突持续到了球员通道
and the discussions are continuing into the tunnel.

388
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,760
好了好了，没事了，没事了
It’s fine, it’s fine, it’s fine.

389
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,080
嘿！我他妈就操了！
Hey! Fucking hell!

390
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,880
不光是你，哈里也是
It’s the same for you, it’s the same for Harry,

391
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:23,000
卢卡斯也是，你们他妈的倒是跑起来啊！就他妈一分钟了！
it’s the same for Lucas, make the run! One minute to go!

392
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,480
半场结束就差一分钟我们还差点丢一个球
One minute to go and it nearly cost us a goal.

393
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,280
你倒是想让我们咋的？你想让我怎么着？
What should we do? What do you want me to do?

394
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,120
可以了，可以了
It's fine, it's fine.

395
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:34,840
他妈的话都让你给说了！
Because you say all this!

396
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:38,120
跑起来！跑起来啊！为了球队你们倒是跑啊！
Make the run, make the run, make the run for the team!

397
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,200
好
OK.

398
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:49,120
我简单说两句
Very, very quick.

399
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,200
刚才这里发生的一切
What happened in here,

400
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:55,000
我不知道你们是什么个情况，我听到他想让你回来协防
I don’t know the whole of the story, I know that he wants you to come back,

401
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,080
他喊你回追，然后你就…嘤嘤嘤嗯嗯啊啊汪汪汪
I know he wants you to come back but you…enenwawa

402
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,640
如果你们还把自己当小孩儿
but if you are a kid,

403
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,440
当那种娇生惯养的小孩儿
if you are a spoilt guy,

404
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,840
那就歇逼了
it's very bad.

405
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,480
你们能正确处理此事，你们会因此获得成长
If you take it in the right way, you become stronger.

406
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:14,560
可能在一个月前，两个月前
Probably this would be something that wouldn’t happen

407
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:18,000
一年前，两年前，这种事不会发生的
one month ago, two months ago, one year ago, two years ago.

408
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,800
之所以现在会有这种事，是因为你们对彼此的要求更高了
It happened because now you demand more from... from each other,

409
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,360
你们身上的责任感更重了，你们也会更努力的去拼了
you feel more the responsibility, where you have to give more.

410
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:30,120
我们担不起半场结束前最后一分钟丢球
We cannot concede a goal in the last minute of the first half

411
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,520
同样担不起全场结束前最后一分钟丢球
and we cannot concede a goal in the last minute of the second half,

412
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:37,080
所以说如果你们能以积极的方式化解矛盾，对我来说，非常完美
so if you take it in a positive way, for me, it’s perfect.

413
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,800
屁点大的事儿
For me, it’s perfect.

414
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,760
加油！嘿！冲啊！
Come on, hey. Let’s go!

415
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:49,400
洛塞尔索再次抢回球权
Lo Celso once again has won the ball well.

416
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,960
凶狠的铲断，动作幅度很大
There’s some big challenges in there.

417
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,960
美丽足球是一点都谈不上了，甚至很多人可能会用丑陋来形容
Wasn’t the prettiest, probably, someone would say it was ugly,

418
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:01,800
真刀真枪的激战，拳拳到肉
but there was plenty of fight in there, quite literally.

419
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:08,240
这是一场对热刺来说非常重要的胜利，三分收入囊中，这比什么都重要
Big win for Spurs, it was all about the three points today and Spurs get it.

420
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,320
当你身处比赛当中的时候，你知道，有时候
When you are in the action, you know, sometimes it’s difficult to manage

421
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:18,080
很难控制住自己的情绪，所以我当时有点失控
your emotions so that something that make me a bit out of control

422
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,920
但最好的解决办法就是握手言和，共同前行
but the best way is to shake the hand and to move on.

423
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:25,880
嗯，很多时候，在球场上咄咄逼人的恶汉
Uh, most of the time, the craziest guy on the pitch,

424
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,920
场下都是软萌的小泰迪
they are teddy bears on the life.

425
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:33,040
在这种时候，我们只要能赢就行
In moments like this, we have just to win.

426
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,360
第一个三分入账！咱后面有戏！
First three points, we are alive.

427
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,720
咱还有得踢！
We are alive!

428
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:49,360
我不是一个喜欢跟别人争执起冲突的人
I'm not a guy who like to fight or shout back.

429
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:50,840
嗯…
Uh...

430
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:57,040
当然了，对于雨果，我非常尊重他，无论是作为队长，球员还是为人
Of course, Hugo, I respect him so much as a captain, as a player, as a human.

431
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,760
当我在球场的时候，我会倾其所有的拼尽全力
If I am on the pitch, I will do everything if it’s possible,

432
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:04,800
我是那种会逼自己去拼的人，去赢得一切
I am the guy who wants work and who wants win everything.

433
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:09,680
足球世界里这种事情司空见惯的，我们的关系其实比家人还要亲密
And this is happen in football, we are like more than family

434
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:15,320
我们之间相处的时间，我也好，雨果也好
so we spend time I think, almost, with me, with Hugo,

435
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:19,800
已经有五六年了，这都是正常的
almost now six years, five years and I think it’s normal.

436
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:25,320
每当踏上球场的时候，每个人奔着当赢家去的
I don’t think we've ever gone on the pitch not wanting to win but sometimes,

437
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,520
但有时候为了赢得比赛，要学会放下骄傲
you have to take pride in winning scrappy games, ugly games,

438
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:32,200
你不可能常常比赛都完爆对手
you’re never going to always out-play the opposition.

439
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:35,680
总是追求每场都能赢得漂亮是不可能的
You’re never always gonna just, like, win by playing pretty football.

440
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,760
场上的十一个人沆瀣一气，团结一心
When you’ve got eleven people pulling in that same direction,

441
00:28:38,840 --> 00:28:41,320
力往一处使，这比什么都重要
then it’s about the fight more than anything.

442
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,960
穆帅给了我们一些提点，我觉得都是非常重要的
José, he gave us a little bit of a wake up call so I think it was very important.

443
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:49,480
他所希望的是我们努力成为赢家，当然这也是我们所奋斗的方向
All he wants us to be is winners and I think that’s what we want to be

444
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,480
不断拼搏，努力去赢
going... going forward.

445
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,960
热刺对阵埃弗顿成功零封对手之后
Spurs follow a clean sheet against Everton,

446
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,000
对阵伯恩茅斯也成功零封
with another one against Bournemouth.

447
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:06,400
双方在活力球场互交白卷
It’s all over here goalless at the Vitality stadium.

448
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:10,760
但这一次他们没能取得进球，仅仅带走了一分
But this time they fail to score, taking just a point from the game.

449
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:13,440
他们现在积分榜排名第九
They are now in ninth place,

450
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:16,360
欧冠席位已经是遥不可及了
and are unlikely to qualify for the Champions League.

451
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,480
但争取欧联席位仍有一线希望
But there is still a chance they could qualify for the Europa League.

452
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,800
- 嘿，若泽  - 来吧，马特
- Hey, José. - Let's go, Matt.

453
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:32,360
球迷对这个赛季可谓相当的失望和愤怒
The fans are pretty frustrated and angry about the season,

454
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,720
他们愤怒的根源还是因为一支上赛季打入欧冠决赛的队伍
um, they’re just angry about the fact that a team and a club

455
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:39,320
一家这样的俱乐部，现在只能在英超的联赛积分榜里
that was in the Champions League final now sits in... in ninth position

456
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:40,920
屈居第九
in the Premier League table.

457
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,320
你能不能给球迷一些鼓励乐观的言论
Can you give them any encouragement or optimism

458
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:46,040
告诉他们只是这个赛季倒霉
that this is just a one-off bad season?

459
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:51,480
我认为我想传递出的信息已经非常简单了，就是说
I think the message is very, very simple, which is...

460
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:57,920
球迷们不开心，球队里也没有人开心的起来
supporters are not happy, nobody in this club is happy.

461
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:04,440
上赛季的欧冠决赛之后
I think that after Champions League final,

462
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:09,280
我认为决赛败北的苦果令他们难以下咽
I think was very, very difficult for them to digest.

463
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,640
当下很难很难去相信
Was very, very difficult to... to...

464
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:20,280
明天一觉醒来，太阳照常升起，仿佛无事发生
to believe that the next day, the sun would be shining again.

465
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:29,640
从那一刻开始，整个方向就
And from that moment, I think the direction was...

466
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,320
变得非常非常难
was very, very difficult.

467
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:39,720
然后在本赛季最关键的阶段
Then the accumulation of injuries in a crucial part of the...

468
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:41,480
伤病潮来势汹汹
of the season too.

469
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,680
加上埃里克森这样的核心球员
Also the situation of a very important player like Christian

470
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,560
拒绝与俱乐部续约
refusing to sign a new contract.

471
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,240
大俱乐部，总有起起伏伏的时候
Big clubs, they have moments of transition.

472
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:57,480
有时候他们会置换新的球员，有时候他们会…失去一些球员
They have moments of replacing players. They have moments of... of losing players.

473
00:30:57,560 --> 00:31:03,600
唯一支撑我坚定乐观
The thing that keeps me strong and optimistic and

474
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:08,400
并对俱乐部和整个计划200%忠诚的关键因素是
200% loyal to the club and to the... to the project

475
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:12,840
我明确的之后俱乐部想要更进一步的野心
is to know that the club wants to improve.

476
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:16,240
你知道赢下德比战的重要性的
You know how important it is to win a derby match

477
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:19,960
尤其实在伦敦这块，热刺肯定想胜阿森纳一头
and obviously in this part of London, for Spurs to finish above Arsenal

478
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,800
就像过去的几年间一样
as they have in the last few years.

479
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,200
我们正在为我们尚且还能争取的东西奋斗
We are fighting for the only thing that we can fight for.

480
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:29,000
一分之差，还有四场比赛要踢
One point distance, four matches to go,

481
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:32,760
在此之上，还有这场德比
in the top of that, there is... there is a rivalry

482
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:38,960
毕竟终归到底，这家俱乐部是因球迷而建，也是为球迷而生
because in the end the club is... is made by and for the fans.

483
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:44,080
球迷们对这种比赛有着特殊的感情
And the fans, they have a special feeling for this match

484
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:47,920
所以场上的球员需要为球迷博上一切
so the people that is on the pitch has to fight for them.

485
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,160
热刺的下一场比赛毫无疑问是本赛季的重中之重
Tottenham’s next match is arguably their biggest of the season.

486
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,000
他们将面对熟悉的宿敌，阿森纳
They face their oldest rivals, Arsenal.

487
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,880
当两家俱乐部从地理上来说就门户相对
When there’s two teams who are literally right on the doorstep to each other,

488
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,600
显然火药味会相当浓烈，也就是北伦敦之战
obviously there’s gonna be a rivalry and it’s that fight for North London

489
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:11,440
对于俱乐部来说，对于球员来说，这绝对是一场非常重要的比赛
and it’s an important game for the club, for the players

490
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,840
但对于球迷而言，特殊意义更是无以复加
but for the fans, it’s just that extra special.

491
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,080
两家球队都想着弄死对方
Both teams love to beat each other.

492
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:20,160
每周的比赛你都会想赢，但是，你知道的
Every week you want to win, but yeah, you know what it means,

493
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,120
这样的比赛总是有着更深的意义的
it’s always got a special edge to it.

494
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,920
接下的所有比赛中
Out of the remaining fixtures,

495
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:27,080
这场比赛是球迷真正非常期待的
this is the one where the fans are really looking forward to.

496
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,320
对于球迷而言意义非凡
This is the one that means the most to them.

497
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,560
热刺与阿森纳之间的宿怨可以追溯到一百年前
The rivalry between Spurs and Arsenal began over a hundred years ago.

498
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:38,000
1913年，阿森纳从南伦敦搬到了海布里
In 1913, Arsenal moved from South London to Highbury.

499
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:40,160
距离托特纳姆仅有四英里
Just four miles from Tottenham.

500
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,440
阿森纳白嫖了一个名额进军顶级联赛
Arsenal were then awarded a place in the first division,

501
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:48,240
随之而来的代价就是热刺惨遭降级
at the expense of Spurs, who were relegated to make way.

502
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,520
接下来的22年里，阿森纳在联赛几乎都是踩着热刺踢
For 22 years, Arsenal had dominated Tottenham in the league.

503
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,680
传给凯恩！头球攻门！哈里·凯恩！
Towards Kane, there’s the header! Harry Kane...

504
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,160
但是近来热刺逐渐占据上风
But recently, Spurs have been coming out on top.

505
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,000
连续三个赛季力压阿森纳
And have finished above them for the past three seasons.

506
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,880
打门！球进了！
Goes for it... Oh yes!

507
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:10,600
漂亮！哈里·凯恩！
Oh yes, Harry Kane!

508
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,600
技惊四座的打门！
That is absolutely sensational.

509
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,880
我摸不清楚你们是咋想的哈
I don’t know if you have the same opinion as I have.

510
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,280
咱经历的都不一样
We have all different experiences

511
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,320
咱生涯里的比赛也好，尤其是德比战
in our careers of derbies and matches like this.

512
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,480
最重要的是理解比赛的意义
Most important thing is the way you understand the game,

513
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:42,280
你对比赛的感受，你准备好怎么做
the way you feel the game, what you are ready to do

514
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:45,360
个人来说也好，从球队来说也好
individually, collectively.

515
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,760
从积分榜来说，确实，你们知道比赛的意义
In terms of the table, of course, you know what it means,

516
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,400
这是我们争夺欧联席位的机会
is a opportunity to play Europa League is to win

517
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:56,640
得赢接下来的四场比赛
the four matches that we... that we have.

518
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,120
抛开这个不谈
But independent of that,

519
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,200
这比赛的意义…
what the game means for...

520
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,640
对俱乐部来说，对球迷来说，对每个人来说
for the club, for the fans, for everybody.

521
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,480
能赢的球队不见得是能力更强的
The team that win is not the team with more quality,

522
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:10,040
不见得是表现更好的
it’s not the best team, it’s not the team

523
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:13,800
也不见得是积分榜排名更高的
that is in a better position in... in the table.

524
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:19,200
而是对比赛感受更深刻的球队
It’s the team that feels the game more than the other.

525
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:23,000
我们真的得拼了，死磕到底，加油吧
And we have to fight, fight... Come on.

526
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:32,640
这是一场注定备受关注的比赛，日程表上要标注星号的那种比赛
It’s always a massive fixture. The biggest one on the calendar.

527
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:35,840
这可是北伦敦德比，谁不想赢呢
It is North London derby, it’s the one that we all want to win.

528
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:38,640
所以只能祈祷这帮球员能使出全力去比赛吧
So fingers crossed that they sort of come out and play.

529
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:40,680
埃里克·戴尔被禁赛四场
Eric Dier’s been banned for four games.

530
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,640
所以戴尔并不会出场
So Dier won’t be there.

531
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:45,360
我感觉缺少他是很难打的，因为他是整个队里
I think he’s a big miss because he’s the nearest thing

532
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:49,280
最能重拳出击、振臂怒吼、拼尽全力的人了
we’ve got to someone who’s gonna clench his fists and shout and really dig in.

533
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,600
北伦敦德比就是今天了
It’s North London derby day.

534
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:54,760
热刺将首次在托特纳姆热刺球场
Spurs face Arsenal at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium

535
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,640
迎战阿森纳
for the very first time.

536
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:59,680
两支球队在积分榜上争夺欧联席位只差一分
One point between them in the fight for Europe.

537
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:05,000
对于若泽·穆里尼奥和米克尔·阿尔特塔来说，这是他们的
For José Mourinho and Mikel Arteta, this is a first North London derby

538
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,320
第一场北伦敦德比
in the dugouts.

539
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:09,440
这已经无关联赛和其他因素了
It doesn’t matter about the league or anything like that,

540
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:12,880
就是要干他丫的，给丫按在地上锤
really we just want to beat them, we just want to finish above them.

541
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:16,680
这场比赛是所有人都在期待的，而且咱必须拿下
This game’s the one we’re all waiting for. This is the one we’ve got to win.

542
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:21,160
不为别的，咱就是为了这口气也得给他拿下
This is a game where the only thing to play for now is pride.

543
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,800
我们今天要是能赢，这赛季一笔勾销
If we win today, all if forgiven.

544
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,840
确实确实，咱今天要是给他拿下，发生了啥都不算个事儿
That's for sure, if we win today, I don’t care what happens.

545
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:28,200
只要今天能赢
We just need to win today.

00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,880
哈里·凯恩梅开二度

689
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:02,760
将自己的职业生涯总进球数提升到了200球以上
to take his tally to over two hundred career goals.

690
00:44:02,840 --> 00:44:06,480
200球是一种神奇的体验
Two hundred goals is just an amazing feeling.

691
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:09,560
职业生涯中会经历大大小小的里程碑时刻
During your career you kind of go through landmarks like that

692
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,840
当时可能都没有什么感觉，但等到我退役
and you don’t fully take it in. It will be when I finish playing,

693
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,840
会看我的职业生涯，才会发现原来已经达到了这么多成就
you look back and you realise what you have actually done.

694
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:18,120
对于我而言，我达到了200球里程碑
For me, I’ve scored two hundred goals

695
00:44:18,200 --> 00:44:21,920
但更重要的是，什么时候我能打进我的下100个进球，甚至下200个进球
but it’s about how quickly can I get the next hundred, or next two hundred.

696
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:27,160
今日哈里的妻子和他们的两个女儿来训练中心看望他
Today Harry’s wife and two daughters have joined him at the training centre

697
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:30,680

699
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:35,280
- 男孩子，我估计是个男孩子  - 我也觉得
- Boy, I think boy. - Boy.

700
00:44:39,680 --> 00:44:44,560
我觉得当你的个人生活非常顺利的时候
I think there’s a big part of it when your personal life is going well,

701
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,400
很大程度上也能推动你的职业生涯顺利走下去

706
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,720
- 蓝色  - 你俩一个要蓝色，一个要粉色
- Blue. - You want blue, you want pink.

707
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:02,160
我一直让凯特也别看那封信，所以说
I’ve been keeping Kate away from the letter so,

708
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:04,880
绝对的大惊喜，绝对的
this a complete surprise, really.

709
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:08,520
讲道理，一点线索都没有反而更加令人期待
Honestly, ain't got a clue what it’s going to be so we're excited.

710
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:10,880
你们觉得爸爸会命中嘛？嗯？
Do you think Daddy's gonna score a goal? Yeah?

711
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:15,320
爸爸加油！爸比加油！
Go Daddy! Daddy, go!

712
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:19,200
这球比我想象中要小啊
That ball looks smaller than I thought.

713
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:21,120
准备好了吗？
Ready?

714
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:30,440
噢！是个男孩儿！

716
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:42,960
- 哈里，感觉如何？ - 惊喜不？
- How you feeling, Harry? - Shocked?

717
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,880
惊喜，确实，我太惊喜了，完全是个大惊喜
Shocked, yeah. I'm really surprised. I'm really surprised.

718
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:49,520
我一直都以为会是个女儿
I was adamant it was going to be a girl.

719
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:50,600
是男孩儿是吗？
Is it a boy?

720
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,160
天哪
Oh, my God.

721
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,040
- 再来一个小女孩儿！  - 你爹想也没有啊！
- Do a little girl now. - I can't do a little...

722
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,120
还指望啥呐！你妈妈就怀了这一个崽！
That's it! There's no more.

723
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:01,960
场下的生活非常的精彩，场上也一样
Things are exciting off the pitch and they’re exciting on the pitch as well.

724
00:46:02,040 --> 00:46:05,480
我们赛季末的表现非常出色，所以希望我们能争取到欧联席位吧
We're finishing strong so hopefully we can get a Europa League spot

725
00:46:05,560 --> 00:46:09,400
下赛季至少还能四线作战
and at least be in four competitions next year.

726
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,160
热刺的下一个三分所要面临的对手
Standing in the way of another three points,

727
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:16,280
同时也是本赛季的最后一次主场作战的对手

728
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:19,200
是欧冠席位的有力竞争者，莱斯特城

729
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:25,320
来吧，大家都清楚自己的任务
Come on, everybody know your jobs.

730
00:46:25,880 --> 00:46:29,480
进军欧联就看这一场了，兄弟们，重中之重
Big step to go to Europe. Big step, right here.

736
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,080
晃到了本内特！热刺首开纪录！

精彩的配合造就的第二个进球！

738
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:02,320
凯恩打门！非比寻常的进球！

739
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,560
热刺正在为本赛季画上一个有力的句号

740
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:08,680
八天打赢了三场比赛
and have won three in the space of eight days.

741
00:47:09,320 --> 00:47:13,040
恭喜你们再下一城，非常全面的表现
Congratulations on the win. I mean, that seemed quite comprehensive really.

742
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,240
你怎么评价球队今天的表现
What did you make of the performance today?

743
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:19,160
我对球队非常欣慰，因为这场比赛的压力非常大
I am very happy because it’s a game with a lot of pressure to us,

744
00:47:19,240 --> 00:47:22,760
我们拼到了最后一刻
and we are fighting until we can.

745
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:27,040
一分接着一分，一场接着一场，马上就是最终战了
Point after point, match after match and seeing the end.

746
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:32,120
热刺主场的收官战以胜利告终
Spurs are victorious in their last home game.

747
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,320
今天，球队主席和教练
And today, the Chairman and Head Coach

748
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,840
将在球馆的天花板上鸟瞰整座球场和伦敦的天际线
are getting a bird’s eye view of the stadium and the London sky line.

749
00:47:40,360 --> 00:47:41,360
行不？
OK?

750
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:43,760
- 感觉还行不？  - 能行
- Feel OK? - Yeah.

751
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:46,240
我倒不是恐高
I’m not bad with heights,

752
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:51,080
就是当你俯视去看你原本熟悉的东西，会有一点点奇怪
it's only when I look down that sometimes, I feel a bit strange.

753
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,760
- 若泽，你恐高不？  - 我恐高
- José, are you good with heights? - No.

754
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:56,080
淦
No.

755
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,520
他们将被带上屋顶
They're about to be taken up on to the roof,

756
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,600
距离球场地面150英尺
a hundred and fifty feet above the pitch

757
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:06,160
他们将成为球场“勇闯天涯”项目的首批体验者
and be amongst the first to try out The Dare Skywalk.

758
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:19,000
你说我要不要先给球队交代一下周天怎么搞，以往万一我就交代在这了
Do you want me to tell the team for Sunday in case I don’t come back?

759
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,520
我感觉VAR比这个还恐怖
I think VAR is more scary than this.

760
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:31,880
你明明进球了还得在那等，算是不算
When you score a goal and you are there waiting, goal, no goal.

761
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:38,240
以我们热刺的体量来讲，咱们的球员跟球迷
Tottenham is a size of a club that our players and our fans

762
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,520
都希望我们，也都习惯了我们每年有欧战踢
expect us, and have got used to us being in Europe,

763
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,760
但是你也知道，咱这个赛季过的那是一个难上加难
but you know, we have had a very, very difficult season.

764
00:48:44,840 --> 00:48:48,880
所以我觉得以这种成绩收官，虽然不是那么的令人满意
So I think to end up in a place, not that it’s satisfactory,

765
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,880
但至少，咱还有欧战能踢
um, but to end up still being in Europe,

766
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:56,800
在这种情况之下，我觉得吧，也是一个能接受的成绩
I think, in the circumstances, will be a good place to end up.

767
00:49:04,400 --> 00:49:05,560
噢！
Oh!

768
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:13,000
幸好我有个东西可以抓着
I'm glad I got something to hold onto.

769
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:18,560
这地方最合适把经纪人带来谈判了
It’s the best place to bring the agents to negotiate.

770
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:23,880
哟，那是爷的教练席，额滴个乖乖
Oh, look at my bench. Oh, my god.

771
00:49:27,080 --> 00:49:28,360
牛逼普拉斯
Incredible.

772
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:33,800
我向来每年都是有欧战踢的，所以我也不希望这是我头一遭
I always qualified for Europe so I don’t want to be the first time

773
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:35,720
欧战没得踢
of not qualifying for Europe.

774
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,640
于我，于球员，于球迷来说，都是非常重要的
It’s very important for me, for the players, for the fans,

775
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:40,120
对俱乐部的每一个人来说都是
for the club, for everybody.

776
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:45,560
对于球员的精神层面，保持这种骄傲也是非常非常重要的
But for the mental, by the pride side, it’s very, very important.

777
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:53,040
来到赛季的收官战，热刺在积分榜排名第八
Going into the last match, Tottenham sit in eighth.

778
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:57,440
狼队目前暂时以一分领先，热刺只要能比狼队踢得好
If they can secure a better result than Wolves, who are just one point ahead,

779
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:01,280
他们就能顺利确保进军下赛季的欧联杯
they will guarantee themselves a place in next season's Europa League.

780
00:50:02,960 --> 00:50:04,840
你们都吭哧瘪肚12个月了
You are working for twelve months.

781
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,280
从他妈的去年6月份开始
Fucking since July.

782
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:09,440
加油，就没理由咱不给自己个交代
Come on, it's impossible we don't do it.

783
00:50:09,560 --> 00:50:11,840
来吧来吧，嘿！冲啊！给爷冲！
Come on, hey! Let’s go, hey! Let’s go!

784
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,200
兄弟们！干他们，冲就完了！
Let's go. Let's go, boys!

785
00:50:14,360 --> 00:50:18,200
对热刺来说，本赛季格外的非比寻常、跌宕起伏
For Spurs, it has been the most unusual and dramatic of campaigns.

786
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:24,040
一路从停摆、波切蒂诺下课、穆里尼奥接任
Along with the lockdown, Pochettino’s departure and Mourinho’s arrival,

787
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:29,080
埃里克森转会，阿尔德维雷尔得续约，凯恩、孙兴慜、洛里、西索科接连受伤
Eriksen leaving, Alderweireld staying, injuries to Kane, Son, Lloris and Sissoko.

788
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:32,480
太多太多故事了，但是在穆里尼奥麾下的第一个完整赛季
Too many stories to mention, but claiming Europa League football

789
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,120
成功进军下赛季的欧联杯
ahead of a first full season under Mourinho

790
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:38,760
也算是一个不错的方式来结束2019/20赛季
would be a good way to end 2019/20.

791
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:45,440
西索科…凯恩…
Sissoko... Kane...

792
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:49,160
精准找到卢卡斯，孙兴慜在中路跑位绝佳
well-weighted into Lucas Moura. Now Son’s made a good run into the middle.

793
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:50,240
洛塞尔索
Here’s Lo Celso...

794
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:52,120
一脚劲射
who will have a crack at goal.

795
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:58,160
目前切尔西0-0狼队，所以狼队暂位列积分榜第六
Chelsea nil, Wolves nil currently so Wolves is hanging onto sixth.

796
00:50:58,240 --> 00:51:00,680
他们只要比热刺的结果强就行
They only have to match Spurs result.

797
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:05,360
洛塞尔索，直塞凯恩
Lo Celso slips in Kane...

798
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,600
打门！手起刀落！
who pulls the trigger in emphatic fashion.

799
00:51:13,160 --> 00:51:15,280
典型的哈里·凯恩式进球
Typical Harry Kane.

800
00:51:19,080 --> 00:51:22,200
那么热刺暂时来到了积分榜第六
So, at the moment Spurs are moving up to sixth.

801
00:51:23,240 --> 00:51:24,480
卢卡斯·莫拉
Lucas Moura...

802
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:28,160
找到了空挡，他能拿到球吗，他拿到了！
looks to spring into a gap, will he meet the ball? Yes, he does.

803
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,440
漂亮！
That was brilliant work.

804
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,040
来到中场休息
It is half time,

805
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:37,000
顺便一提，来自斯坦福桥的突发新闻
and by the way, breaking news from Stamford Bridge,

806
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,600
切尔西对狼队拔得头筹
Chelsea have taken the lead against Wolves.

807
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,320
无疑是利好热刺的消息
That’s great news for Spurs.

808
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:45,040
如果局面持续到比赛结束，热刺将挺进欧联
If it all stays like this, Spurs are going into the Europa League.

809
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:49,760
咱防的不错，但是还得控制住比赛局面
We are defending quite well but we need to control the game.

810
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:52,920
咱得更为稳定一点
We need to be more, more consistent.

811
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:56,080
如果联赛现在就收官
If the league finished now,

812
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:58,200
咱能捞到一个第六
in this moment, we are sixth,

813
00:51:58,280 --> 00:52:03,000
但是咱得赢下比赛，随时可能有新的变局
but we need to win the game. The game can go in two directions.

814
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,880
加油兄弟们！加油！
Come on, lads. Come on!

815
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:14,000
看样子只要一场平局热刺就能安稳收官
As things stand even a draw would be enough for Spurs

816
00:52:14,080 --> 00:52:16,480
因为狼队目前0-2落后
because Wolves are trailing two-nil.

817
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:21,000
穆里尼奥已经知道之一消息了，但他不想让他的球员分心
And Mourinho will know the score line, but he will want his players to focus.

818
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:22,240
我们的球！
Our ball!

819
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:25,400
奥里耶在角旗区遭到紧逼
Serge Aurier under real pressure near the corner flag.

820
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,040
解围！再来！
Away! Again!

821
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:36,280
热刺惨遭当头棒喝
And it’s a big blow for Spurs.

822
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:41,120
热刺目前输不起
Spurs cannot afford to lose here,

823
00:52:42,280 --> 00:52:44,600
因为但凡他们输一个，他们都保不住第六了
because if they lose, they will not claim sixth

824
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:47,200
斯坦福桥那边干啥都不顶用
no matter what happens at Stamford Bridge.

825
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:50,760
乔尔·沃德
Joel Ward...

826
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,200
噢！再次命中横梁
Oh, it's hit against the frame of the goal.

827
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:54,400
看球啊！
Look, look the ball!

828
00:52:54,480 --> 00:52:57,080
这个位置危险了，阿尤
Precarious position this, Ayew!

829
00:52:58,240 --> 00:52:59,920
现在进入伤停补时阶段
So we are now into added time.

830
00:53:02,840 --> 00:53:04,360
水晶宫的球
It will be a Palace ball.

831
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:10,320
危险的传球
Delivery is dangerous...

832
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:12,360
稍稍偏出
and it's just wide.

833
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:20,640
全场比赛结束哨响，狼队保持落后，已经足够了
That is the full-time whistle and with Wolves losing, this will be enough.

834
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,880
穆里尼奥和他的主教团队正在庆祝
Mourinho and his coaching staff are celebrating.

835
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:30,200
我作为教练已经有点被惯坏了，因为我的职业生涯早就习惯了
I’m quite a spoilt coach because my career was always about

836
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,880
赢冠军，赢冠军，赢冠军
winning trophies, winning trophies, winning trophies.

837
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:37,800
我还从来没想象过自己会为了赛季末排名第六而兴高采烈
I would never imagine myself celebrating in the end of the season finishing sixth,

838
00:53:39,880 --> 00:53:43,760
但是我把他们从十四名带到了第六名
but to arrive fourteenth and to finish sixth,

839
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:45,520
也还算不错是吧？
a good achievement?

840
00:53:47,840 --> 00:53:48,840
至少我自己是这么认为的
I would say so.

841
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:07,040
[♪ AJ Tracey & Mabel: “West Ten”]

842
00:54:22,640 --> 00:54:26,000
我接手热刺的时候，热刺是一家比现在小得多的俱乐部
Tottenham when I took over was a much smaller club than it is today,

843
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:30,120
我看着这家俱乐部就像一头沉睡中的猛兽
I saw this club as a club that was really a sleeping giant.

844
00:54:30,960 --> 00:54:33,120
咱现在到了这个阶段得赢点什么了
We are now in a period where we need to win.

845
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:37,520
讲道理，我一直是个热刺球迷，我希望俱乐部越来越好
You know, I’m a spurs fan and I want to see this club continue to grow

846
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:39,880
我也想要看到冠军头衔
and I want to see trophies.

847
00:54:41,040 --> 00:54:43,840
各位，我稍微说两句哈
Can I just have your attention for a minute, please?

848
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:53,000
首先，我想要感谢大家在这个艰难的赛季的所有付出
Firstly, I want to, uh, thank you all for what has been a difficult season

849
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:54,480
无论是场上还是场下
both on and off the pitch,

850
00:54:54,560 --> 00:54:57,560
无论世界上今天发生了啥
and what’s going on in the world today.

851
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:00,800
咱以一个不错的成绩收官，我个人还是很满意的
I’m very pleased that we're finishing the season in a good place

852
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:03,600
但咱们队里有两个队员
but two members of our team,

853
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:06,880
很遗憾下赛季不会再跟我们并肩作战了
as we know, won’t be back next year, unfortunately.

854
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:10,520
来吧，米歇尔、杨，你俩上来吧
So Michel and Jan, I would like you to come up here.

855
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:19,120
你们两个人都毫无疑问是球队的铁血功勋
Both you guys have been an absolute credit to this club,

856
00:55:19,760 --> 00:55:23,000
我们非常感谢你们的付出，这里随时欢迎你们回来
we would like to thank you very much, you are always welcome back.

857
00:55:23,080 --> 00:55:26,360
无论你们将来的决定是什么，我们都衷心祝愿你们一路都好
Wish you both the best of luck in whatever you decide to do,

858
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:29,560
我们给你们买了个小礼物
and we have a small gift that we bought both of you.

859
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,560
一人一块手表，背后还会给你们刻字
We bought you both a watch and we'll get something engraved

860
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:34,640
专属定制
on the back for you.

861
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,080
非常感谢大家
Thank you very much.

862
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:42,480
这赛季着实是不容易
I think this season is a difficult one,

863
00:55:42,560 --> 00:55:46,640
但未来会越来越好的，我会永远想念大家
the future will be bright and I’m going to miss everyone.

864
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:48,320
感谢你们所作的一切
So, thank you for everything.

865
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,280
非常感谢大家，八年前我刚来的时候
Thank you very much, I came here eight years ago

866
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,720
跟现在大不一样
in a total different environment.

867
00:55:57,840 --> 00:56:02,360
这些年很多东西都变了，无论是作为俱乐部还是作为球队
A lot has changed over the years, where we are now as a club, as a team,

868
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,720
我为大家而骄傲
you have made me very proud.

869
00:56:04,920 --> 00:56:06,960
大家对我来说意义非凡
You guys mean so much to me,

870
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:10,360
我很确定未来我没办法再找到这样的一直球队了
I know for sure I will never find a team like this again.

871
00:56:17,080 --> 00:56:21,080
我一般不怎么看球，完整看完一场90分钟的球赛
I don’t watch a lot of football. I think in total 90 minutes I watch,

872
00:56:21,160 --> 00:56:23,240
我印象中一个赛季不超过五次
not even five games a season,

873
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:29,360
但是下个赛季我会尽可能的收看每一场热刺的比赛
but I will watch every Spurs game that I can next season.

874
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:32,560
大都知道，球迷们管你叫超人詹
As we know, the fans call you Super Jan,

875
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,920
所以大伙儿也给你准备了一个礼物
so we’ve also got a gift that’s actually from all your teammates.

876
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:44,240
他们比赛之后我会给每个人打Facetime的，我一定会
I know, everyone I will FaceTime them after the game, I definitely know I will.

877
00:56:44,320 --> 00:56:47,440
他们下赛季很有机会赢下大把的冠军奖杯
And they have got good chances of winning something next season

878
00:56:47,520 --> 00:56:49,280
所以也祝他们一切都好
so hopefully for them they can now.

879
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:52,600
我会一直关注他们的，这会是一种很特别的感觉
And yeah, I will follow them and it will be very special.

880
00:56:55,960 --> 00:57:02,120
热刺在过去的12个月里踢了52场比赛，史无前例最长的赛季
Spurs have played 52 games over 12 months, the longest season in their history.

881
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:06,920
一个跌宕起伏的赛季，跟做过山车一样
An up and down season, been of a rollercoaster of a season,

882
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:11,480
从我个人的角度来说，伤病这些东西都是这种感觉
obviously from a personal point of view of being injured and things like that.

883
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:13,720
但是从球队的角度来说
And just from a team point of view, whenever

884
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:16,320
赛季初是一个教练，赛季结束换成了另一个
you start with one manager and finish with another,

885
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,520
那这注定是一个不平凡的赛季
it means it’s going to be a strange season.

886
00:57:19,600 --> 00:57:23,120
我们这赛季经历了不少困难的低谷，这没什么掩饰的
There's no hiding the fact that we went through a few difficult spells,

887
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:26,880
但是你环顾四周，看看咱球队这个实力
and when we look at the quality we have in the team and around the place,

888
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,680
所有东西，从训练场到球场，每一样东西，我觉得
everything we have from training ground to stadium, everything is, I think,

889
00:57:30,760 --> 00:57:32,880
咱就是欧冠级别的
you know, the quality is Champions League.

890
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,840
没拿到前四诚然令人难过
To not get the top four, it was painful

891
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,960
毕竟欧冠是每个球员每个赛季都想踢的比赛
because Champions League everyone wants to play every season,

892
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,080
但至少我们还有欧联杯可以踢
but at least the minimum you get is Europa League

893
00:57:44,200 --> 00:57:48,320
但愿我们能赢下点冠军奖杯，毕竟实力在这
and hopefully we will win some trophies because the quality is there

894
00:57:48,400 --> 00:57:51,560
跟着教练走下去肯定能行的，我丝毫不怀疑
but I’m sure with this manager, we will do it.

895
00:57:54,240 --> 00:57:56,880
我非常期待下赛季的开踢，因为
I look forward to the beginning of next season because

896
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:01,840
这几个月来我们的相处，我们的付出
everything we did, all these months that we spent together,

897
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:05,160
我觉得在未来都会收获回报的
I think are very, very important for the future.

898
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:10,320
我们已经准备好作为一个强大的集体面对任何困难了
We are ready to go through everything like a strong family

899
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:15,280
这是一个坚实的基础
and that creates us a good base,

900
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:18,080
但我想做到更好
but I want it to be better.

901
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:19,800
更好的成果
Better results.

902
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,560
更好的足球
Better football.

903
00:58:22,160 --> 00:58:23,840
我们正在努力赢下冠军江北
We have to try to win a title

904
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:26,680
下赛季一定会更好的
and next season it is going to be better.
