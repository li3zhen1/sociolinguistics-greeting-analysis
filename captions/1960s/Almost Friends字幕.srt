How was your meet today?
今天比得怎么样?

107
00:10:43,543 --> 00:10:47,244
After Brad finished
the 100 meter I thought
we were screwed
布拉德跑完100米以后
我觉得我们输定了

108
00:10:47,246 --> 00:10:48,712
but then Adam Smith
won the 200,
不过后来亚当·史密斯赢了200米

109
00:10:48,714 --> 00:10:52,750
and Adam bedilia came in second
at 110, so we were fine.
亚当·博蒂利亚的110米栏跑了第二
所以还算可以吧

110
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:53,784
Adam bedilia?
亚当·博蒂利亚?

111
00:10:53,786 --> 00:10:57,688
Yeah, he's short.
Kind of skinny, I guess.
对 很矮 有点瘦的那个

112
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,857
Hmm. I thought that
was Adam small.
我以为他叫小亚当

113
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:03,727
No, Adam small is small
but Adam bedilia is short.
不是 小亚当是瘦小
亚当·博蒂利亚是矮

114
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:04,662

I spilled a whole pot
of tea at work today.
It was everywhere.
我今天打翻了一整壶茶

burn yourself, right?
你没事吧? 没烫伤吧?

117
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,802
No, I'm fine. It was just
really embarrassing.

就是超囧

118
00:11:11,804 --> 00:11:13,270
Oh, there's Adam green too,
come to think of it
我想起来了
我们队里还有个亚当·格林

119
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:15,906
but he's a freshman so it's
like a whole other story.
他是新来的
跟那几个又完全不一样了

120
00:11:15,999 --> 00:11:19,877
I'm pretty sure his dad's
a booster and bought him
a spot on the team.
他爸肯定是赞助人
花钱让他进了田径队

121
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:21,245
-Right.
-He's so slow.

we'll still be us?
是啊 不过我们还会和现在一样吗?

135
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,874
-What do you mean?
-I don't know.
- 什么意思?
- 说不好

136
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:52,309
I've just been
thinking a lot lately

You know, I never told Brad
that I took that pregnancy test.
我没把验孕的事情告诉布拉德

850

if it were positive.

Can I get her number?
