Director Jung Cho-sin

9
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:14,086
Is the bank robbery in lately?

10
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:20,565
I sold one for 2 Grand
the other day.

11
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:23,960
Boy, It didn't come easy.

12
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:27,970
It's the latest model,

13
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:32,743
and literally a piece of art.

14
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:34,001
Money?

15
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,174
Put it on my tab.

16
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:41,410
Shove it up your ass, man.
I want cash for it.

17
00:03:41,688 --> 00:03:43,553
no guarantee of success

18
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,054
Put it down and
get the hell out of here.

19
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:47,817
No money, no gun!

20
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:05,770
Is this a joke or what?

21
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,812
It's not a joke.

22
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:10,839
I said, "Put it on my tab."

23
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:23,323
JAKARTA

24
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:43,999
Are you ready?
All set?

25
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:46,370
Don't worry about a thing.

26
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:49,580
I'll walk into the vault
and pick up $3 mi llion.

27
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:52,274
Nobody will suspect me.

28
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,456
I'm not sure about this.

29
00:05:58,624 --> 00:06:00,353
Can we pull this off?

30
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:04,323
I'm the VP of this bank.
Who would suspect me?

31
00:06:05,565 --> 00:06:07,795
It's 9:08.
I'm going in.

32
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,856
Good morning, sir.
Go ahead, sir.

33
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:39,155
What?

34
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:42,233
Oh, okay.

35
00:07:38,724 --> 00:07:40,123
What's going on here?

36
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:41,521
We've got a bank robber!

37
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:46,958
Get him!

38
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:19,825
He's a bank robber!
Call the cops!

39
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:22,633
Police station?

40
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:27,536
This is Okwang Investment Bank.
We've got a bank robber!

41
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,773
Hurry up!

42
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,149
I'll take him to the police,

43
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:44,451
and this bag as evidence.

44
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:50,557
He might try to run.

45
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:53,359
Freeze!
Move and die!

46
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,964
Didn't you hear him?
Get down on the floor!

47
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,133
Cops are that quick?

48
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:06,673
It hasn't even been a minute.

49
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:09,178
What timing.

50
00:09:15,454 --> 00:09:17,752
Don't move!

51
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:23,894
He caught the robber.

52
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,564
You thief!

53
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:30,998
Not him!
He's our vice president.

54
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:32,697
this one is the thief!

55
00:09:33,005 --> 00:09:34,029
Is that right?

56
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:38,200
You son of a bitch!

57
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:41,606
Let's take them down.
Let's go

58
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,409
- Come on!
- I'll sue you for assault.

59
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:48,046
Hey, let me go!

60
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:50,019
You're the key witness.
Come with us.

61
00:09:50,189 --> 00:09:52,657
It hurts!

62
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,192
Don't let anybody in till

63
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:56,158
the investigation is over.

64
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:57,559
Sure!

65
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,488
Yes!

66
00:10:06,138 --> 00:10:09,574
Everybody, back to work!

67
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,141
Back to work!

68
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:16,544
- Hey, come over here.
- Sure.

69
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:22,247
What are you guys doing?
Back to work!

70
00:10:53,953 --> 00:10:55,079
Our van!

71
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:57,756
Money!

72
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:07,326
Where did our van go?
We've 3 bodies in it!

73
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:11,229
Doesn't matter.
We stole it anyway.

74
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,843
Run!

75
00:11:44,236 --> 00:11:47,137
- Where are we?
- Beats me.

76
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,538
Are we in the interrogation room?

77
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:51,835
Interrogation room?

78
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:56,781
What a moron.

79
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,812
Where the hell are we?

80
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:09,818
Hey!

81
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:11,755
Get over here.

82
00:12:12,665 --> 00:12:13,962
Come on!

83
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:17,897
I've got a knife in my pocket.
Get it out!

84
00:12:18,137 --> 00:12:20,230
Stop yelling at me!

85
00:12:20,272 --> 00:12:21,671
How old are you?

86
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:23,867
I'm the vice president!

87
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:26,571
What a stupid jerk.

88
00:12:26,612 --> 00:12:27,237
Come on!

89
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,803
Get it out of my pocket.

90
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,873
I'll untie you, too.

91
00:12:30,983 --> 00:12:32,814
You get it out yourself!

92
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:36,313
Gosh, you're pigheaded.

93
00:12:39,325 --> 00:12:42,385
Okay, fine.
Get the knife, will you?

94
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:47,222
Where is it?

95
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,737
- In that pocket.
- Where?

96
00:13:00,012 --> 00:13:02,344
Yeah, that pocket.
Here?

97
00:13:03,182 --> 00:13:05,241
Down further.

98
00:13:06,018 --> 00:13:08,248
You had to come in right then?

99
00:13:08,354 --> 00:13:11,915
I was about to take off,
and you blew it!

100
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:16,057
It's my bank,
and my daddy's money!

101
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:20,592
If it's your daddy's money,
why bother protecting it?

102
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,367
Move your ass!

103
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:38,945
What do you mean,
I can't get my money back?

104
00:13:38,984 --> 00:13:41,475
We're really sorry, ma'am.
The whole system is down.

105
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,455
What does that have to do
with my money?

106
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,029
- Any word from him?
- Nothing.

107
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,389
He has the key to the vault!

108
00:14:07,546 --> 00:14:09,605
You told me
it was a piece of cake!

109
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:18,056
I didn't expect other rogues.

110
00:14:43,549 --> 00:14:47,986
Idiot!

111
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:51,621
Can't you do better?
Practice more.

112
00:15:02,134 --> 00:15:05,433
Laughing at me?

113
00:15:06,872 --> 00:15:08,999
No, I'm not.

114
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,770
You talked back to me?

115
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:19,576
'No' my ass!

116
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:22,945
I saw you laughing at me
for not hitting the mark!

117
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:27,655
I didn't laugh at you.

118
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:30,060
You just did!

119
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:37,457
Stop!

120
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:44,900
Go easy on him.

121
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:47,535
He fainted.

122
00:15:56,522 --> 00:15:58,319
Did you laughed, too?

123
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:00,785
No, I didn't.

124
00:16:00,893 --> 00:16:02,588
He laughed, too.

125
00:16:06,665 --> 00:16:07,962
I saw him laughing.

126
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:23,647
Not so fast!
You wouldn't go down?

127
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:36,592
Should we kill them?

128
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:39,354
Maybe.

129
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:43,094
We have no choice.
Let's erase them.

130
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:47,134
Yeah, it looks that way.

131
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:10,454
What happened to Blue?

132
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:16,024
Will he talk?

133
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:22,734
I would, if I were him.

134
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:25,475
Pigs are so merciless.

135
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,640
No way he can hand le it.

136
00:17:30,082 --> 00:17:33,984
Last time I talked
before they beat me up.

137
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:41,087
Say something!

138
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,826
What are we doing now?

139
00:17:46,198 --> 00:17:48,223
Let's split.

140
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:51,193
What?

141
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:58,301
If Blue talks, we're in trouble.

142
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:01,144
We'll be better off alone.

143
00:18:01,713 --> 00:18:03,681
We're in the same boat.
We can't get separated!

144
00:18:03,949 --> 00:18:05,314
It's safer if we split up.

145
00:18:13,192 --> 00:18:15,387
Let's think!

146
00:18:15,494 --> 00:18:18,361
He might not talk!

147
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,221
Right!
He doesn't know our names.

148
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,564
He only knows us by red
and White.

149
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:28,904
He knows our names.

150
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,302
I didn't know.

151
00:18:31,810 --> 00:18:34,870
You assholes blew our plan.

152
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:40,148
And now you want us
to let you walk?

153
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:47,859
What did we do with that punk?

154
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:51,760
What punk?
Who?

155
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:57,301
the one that tried to stop us
at this bank in Suwon.

156
00:18:57,569 --> 00:19:01,005
In Suwon?
What are you talking about?

157
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,901
That punk!

158
00:19:03,242 --> 00:19:06,609
Oh, that one!

159
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:08,244
We burnt him, right?

160
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,973
No, did we dump him
into the river?

161
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:14,715
Didn't we send him to the hospital?

162
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:17,856
We were going to,
but he kicked in.

163
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:20,924
He was such a weak boy.

164
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:23,755
Was it that bad?

165
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:30,458
Nah, just a few broken bones
and a visceral cleft.

166
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:36,200
Right, one of his eyes
popped out, too.

167
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:57,788
Let's pop them, bro.

168
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,198
I'm the VP of that bank.
what you want?

169
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:11,536
I'll give you money
if that's what you want.

170
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,035
Just let me go.

171
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:22,276
You're the vice president?

172
00:20:23,455 --> 00:20:25,650
You bet!

173
00:20:26,191 --> 00:20:28,159
Didn't you hear them

174
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,258
sir me at the bank?

175
00:20:30,996 --> 00:20:32,293
I'm really the VP.

176
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,495
What about you?

177
00:20:43,609 --> 00:20:45,042
A bank robber.

178
00:20:46,545 --> 00:20:50,743
You're not cops,

179
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,517
are you?
I know when... Shut up!

180
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:00,551
Get the camcorder.

181
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:06,895
It's your lucky day.

182
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,628
Are you nuts?

183
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:13,029
Why did you tell him?

184
00:21:13,672 --> 00:21:15,367
You know ours.

185
00:21:17,242 --> 00:21:18,834
That's because-

186
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:24,872
You banged him, too?
What a slut!

187
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:26,711
You fuck any...

188
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,247
What do you care?

189
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:29,645
I am not your girl!

190
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,148
Since we're at it,

191
00:21:32,524 --> 00:21:35,084
let me give you another tip.

192
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:37,991
His penis is a lot longer
than yours.

193
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,696
Hello?

194
00:21:47,372 --> 00:21:49,897
Hey, what's up?

195
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:52,908
I'm fucked, man!

196
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,988
Leave a message at the beep.

197
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,991
What happened?
Why doesn't he answer?

198
00:22:16,702 --> 00:22:18,670
I've got this great plan.

199
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:20,101
I'll be right over.

200
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:24,130
Get some thugs and...

201
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:27,436
Bring a girl, too.

202
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:40,684
I've got to jet.
See you later, man.

203
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:00,941
Shit!

204
00:23:01,113 --> 00:23:05,277
911?
Somebody stole my taxi!

205
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,256
Fi lm the VP asshole,
and kill the thief.

206
00:23:29,508 --> 00:23:30,668
What?

207
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:32,035
You do it.

208
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,841
It'll stain my shirt in blood.

209
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:38,438
I absolutely hate it!

210
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:52,993
This isn't fair.
He gets to live?

211
00:23:56,001 --> 00:23:58,834
I didn't do anything wrong.

212
00:23:59,304 --> 00:24:01,772
You aren't the VP.

213
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:05,809
I'm just a thief.

214
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:08,141
Don't you feel sorry for me?

215
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:13,246
We work in the same field.

216
00:24:15,921 --> 00:24:17,718
Don't kill me.

217
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:22,553
Make it quick.

218
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,539
What makes you think
you can kill me?

219
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,874
You guys are so funny.

220
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,908
What fami ly are you with?

221
00:24:45,417 --> 00:24:47,544
Lay your fingers on me,
both of you are dead!

222
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:50,019
Now, you bastards!

223
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:52,817
Untie us.

224
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:55,719
Untie us.

225
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,791
We're dressed up as cops,

226
00:25:28,193 --> 00:25:30,161
but we're bank robbers.

227
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:34,796
But, as the fate decides it,
we've become kidnappers.

228
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,527
Hey! Jin Dal-ho.

229
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:40,002
Want to save your son?
You have to pay us in cash.

230
00:25:40,171 --> 00:25:43,504
I'd like the money
Be quiet!

231
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:46,043
We want 3mi llion.

232
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:49,272
We don't get it in 2 hours,

233
00:25:49,581 --> 00:25:51,446
your son will lose his nose.

234
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:55,217
2 hours after that,
he'll lost something else.

235
00:25:55,587 --> 00:26:00,684
We're not joking.
You know it from his ear.

236
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:08,858
They sent this.

237
00:26:12,637 --> 00:26:13,934
Sick bastards!

238
00:26:14,139 --> 00:26:16,630
Do this for 3 Grand?

239
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:19,169
In case you're confused,

240
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:22,507
we want $3 mi llion.

241
00:26:23,014 --> 00:26:26,848
Show me the money.
America money, America money!

242
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:28,718
Don't do anything stupid.

243
00:26:30,655 --> 00:26:33,351
Who the hell are they?
What's wrong with mine?

244
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:51,125
brother

245
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:57,608
Too much water.

246
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:07,245
Hello?

247
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:09,848
Yeah, it's me.

248
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:14,287
It'll be delivered soon.
You do the delivery.

249
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,788
Okay.

250
00:29:06,244 --> 00:29:10,180
I'm not done yet.

251
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:16,543
5 minutes left,

252
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:19,756
and we don't have the money.

253
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:23,891
Doo-san!

254
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,728
It doesn't get here in 5 minutes-

255
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:35,435
Cut this off,
and send it to him.

256
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:38,868
Don't worry about it.

257
00:29:39,277 --> 00:29:42,872
You can still breath
without it.

258
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:46,711
Come here, boy.

259
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,158
Come in.

260
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:12,101
What is it, Miss. Jo?

261
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,143
Sit down.

262
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:20,350
What's that?

263
00:30:20,885 --> 00:30:26,255
A package from kidnappers, sir.

264
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:53,211
2 hours have passed,
so here's your son's nose.

265
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:56,986
Get us money in 2 hours.

266
00:31:03,928 --> 00:31:05,122
Hello?

267
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:08,060
- It's me.
- Who?

268
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,097
It's me, the kidnapper.

269
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:15,966
Who are you?

270
00:31:16,507 --> 00:31:18,475
Why are you doing this?

271
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:21,436
I don't think
he got the nose yet.

272
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:23,672
Ask him.

273
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:30,619
- Did you get the nose?
- I did.

274
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,413
What do you want me to do?

275
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:36,219
It's already 6!
2 hours have passed!

276
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:41,024
You didn't even tell me
where to send the money.

277
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:47,595
You didn't tell him
where to send it?

278
00:31:59,217 --> 00:32:03,551
Send it to the warehouse
in Koyang by 9 tonight.

279
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:07,484
Only one person comes,
or the deal is off.

280
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:09,052
Okay.

281
00:32:09,327 --> 00:32:10,521
One more thing.

282
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,124
It should be Miss. Jo.

283
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,160
She's your son's lover.

284
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:21,799
Okay.

285
00:32:34,085 --> 00:32:37,316
My secretary will take you
to the warehouse.

286
00:32:39,724 --> 00:32:41,555
Bastards!

287
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:46,663
Don't worry about it, sir.

288
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,799
Go ahead.

289
00:32:51,836 --> 00:32:53,394
I'm on my way.

290
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,867
Sir, won't it be better

291
00:32:59,177 --> 00:33:01,111
if you call the cops?

292
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:03,973
I can't trust them.

293
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:09,085
I got it all figured out.

294
00:35:04,268 --> 00:35:06,463
Cool!

295
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:12,638
They're all topless!

296
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:29,286
It's time she should be here.

297
00:35:31,863 --> 00:35:33,421
Hey, VP.

298
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:36,523
....

299
00:35:36,701 --> 00:35:38,999
Ever been to Venice?

300
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:44,237
Any places you haven't...

301
00:35:44,308 --> 00:35:47,004
That's enough!

302
00:36:06,931 --> 00:36:11,197
What about Buenos Aires?

303
00:36:39,664 --> 00:36:42,827
The girl's here.
She's carrying a bag.

304
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:19,965
Sa-hyun!

305
00:37:20,605 --> 00:37:24,063
Let go of me!

306
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:26,642
Let go!

307
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,306
Don't you move.

308
00:37:37,888 --> 00:37:39,116
Don't!

309
00:38:14,825 --> 00:38:16,383
Doo-san!

310
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:20,489
Doo-san!

311
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,293
Doo-san!

312
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:18,981
Eun-ah!

313
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:27,988
Eun-ah!, Eun-ah!
Eun-ah!, Eun-ah!

314
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:50,148
- Let's go.
- What about Miss. Jo?

315
00:39:50,588 --> 00:39:51,816
She's dead.

316
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,845
Home, sir?

317
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:19,449
- Let's get out of here.
- Yes, sir.

318
00:40:23,187 --> 00:40:27,055
You owe me a total $ 1. 5 million.

319
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,088
Interest alone is half a million!

320
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:35,730
- How-
- Boss!

321
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,932
What did I say?

322
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:44,166
- Talking won't solve it.
- Shut up.

323
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,537
Boss, should I...

324
00:40:55,352 --> 00:40:57,650
Where was I?
Wait...

325
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:00,948
You son of a bitch,

326
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:27,116
You're smoking before me?

327
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:40,159
You've got 15 days.

328
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:44,198
Bring me the money,
or you're dead meat.

329
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:47,064
understand?

330
00:41:58,582 --> 00:42:00,482
I'm robbing the bank.

331
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:05,487
What are you talking about?
You're kidding, right?

332
00:42:07,224 --> 00:42:11,524
I have a plan.

333
00:42:13,831 --> 00:42:15,264
What is it?

334
00:42:15,766 --> 00:42:17,427
I can't tell you now,

335
00:42:17,902 --> 00:42:20,393
Don't worry
but it's very simple.

336
00:42:21,472 --> 00:42:24,703
Don't do it.
There should be another way.

337
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,235
another way?

338
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:29,439
No, this is the only way.

339
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,347
My old man says he can't give me $2 million.

340
00:42:33,417 --> 00:42:36,215
- No other options.

341
00:42:37,488 --> 00:42:39,080
I have no other choice

342
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:41,480
- I'm worried.

343
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:45,486
Don't worry about it.

344
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,530
Everything will be fine.

345
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:53,266
Let's leave the country.

346
00:42:55,239 --> 00:42:56,831
You and me?

347
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:29,897
You found boys?

348
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:32,604
Give me some more time.

349
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:36,002
Unti I when?

350
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:40,576
Don't worry about a thing.
I'll take care of it.

351
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:04,467
Can we talk?

352
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,487
- Is that it?
- Right.

353
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:26,757
Let's check inside.

354
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:32,628
No. I know the place.
Let's go.

355
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:46,378
This is our target,
Okwang Investment Bank.

356
00:44:46,850 --> 00:44:50,946
There $3 million is sitting
in the vault.

357
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:55,648
And this is the sewerage
we're going in through.

358
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:03,891
We'll make a tunnel
to the bottom of the vault.

359
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:06,825
Possible, Blue?

360
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,263
You bet.
Digging a hole is a piece of cake.

361
00:45:09,907 --> 00:45:12,398
We can get to the building
within an hour.

362
00:45:12,576 --> 00:45:17,707
From there up to the target
is exactly 115 centimeters.

363
00:45:18,982 --> 00:45:21,917
It takes 1 hour to dig 40cm
through concrete.

364
00:45:21,952 --> 00:45:25,183
So we'll be under the vault
for 3 hours.

365
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:26,381
3 hours?

366
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:31,320
That much time?

367
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:34,187
Can't you just make a hole
and let ourselves in?

368
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:40,364
Should I get some dynamite?

369
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:45,266
This is the only way.

370
00:45:45,976 --> 00:45:48,774
Do your job right.

371
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:53,276
Okay.

372
00:45:53,951 --> 00:45:56,442
Good.

373
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,480
What about the vault, Blue?

374
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:06,661
It's Elesten 7469 from Sweden,

375
00:46:07,131 --> 00:46:10,225
15.3cm thick.

376
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:15,337
It's wired with sensors
connected to SECOME.

377
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:19,976
- It looks impossible.
- We can do it.

378
00:46:21,845 --> 00:46:26,373
The bottom of the vault is
only 5cm thick.

379
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:50,000
Hello?

380
00:46:50,073 --> 00:46:53,702
$3 million will be wired
next Monday.

381
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:58,281
Okay.

382
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:02,345
- Are you really doing it?
- Sure.

383
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:05,780
Don't worry about it.
It'll be fine.

384
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:07,788
Okay.

385
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:20,961
Eun-ah, take a look at this.

386
00:47:27,845 --> 00:47:32,441
Yeah, that's right.
Thanks.

387
00:47:41,925 --> 00:47:45,417
We can't make it.
What about SECOME?

388
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:48,060
They turn it off when it opens.

389
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:52,296
Those who rob banks
in the afternoon are morons.

390
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:55,461
- You know why?
- No.

391
00:47:56,473 --> 00:48:00,034
Most bank robberies take place
right before they close.

392
00:48:00,410 --> 00:48:05,143
So they turn SECOME on
an hour before they close.

393
00:48:05,782 --> 00:48:10,310
Nobody has robbed banks
when they're opened.

394
00:48:11,288 --> 00:48:14,382
And we'll pass off as cops.

395
00:48:14,625 --> 00:48:17,924
Have you seen bank robbers
dressed up as cops?

396
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:19,452
No.

397
00:48:20,497 --> 00:48:22,897
So we're going to make it.

398
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:25,427
Can we really pull this off?

399
00:48:28,939 --> 00:48:30,736
It's very simple.

400
00:48:32,409 --> 00:48:34,969
All we need to do is dig a hole
along the sewer.

401
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:37,270
Send one of them up.

402
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:41,580
I'll walk in at 9:09

403
00:48:42,052 --> 00:48:45,954
and drag that bastard out.

404
00:48:46,990 --> 00:48:49,458
It will be a perfect crime.

405
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:56,726
That ass was using his head.

406
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:03,505
He was talking about making it
his own perfect crime.

407
00:49:09,479 --> 00:49:11,413
We need fake bills.

408
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:14,874
What for?

409
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:20,254
We'll get money from the vault
and switch it with fake bills.

410
00:49:23,593 --> 00:49:28,292
Then we leave dead bodies
in the sewage.

411
00:49:28,632 --> 00:49:31,795
If we blow the gas pipe that
goes above the tunnel...

412
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:35,496
The cops will think we're dead.

413
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:41,544
Isn't that cool?

414
00:49:42,713 --> 00:49:46,240
Writing a novel or what?
Let him have his fun.

415
00:49:46,683 --> 00:49:48,310
I'll drag him out of there

416
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:51,885
with a bag full of bills.

417
00:49:52,522 --> 00:49:55,821
I'll cut him some slack
once we leave the bank.

418
00:49:57,194 --> 00:50:00,061
I bet he'll beat me up
and try to run.

419
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:07,063
I'll stay down on the street,
holding onto the bag.

420
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:13,739
When the police get there,
I'll tell them he got away.

421
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:28,950
Who could possibly imagine
this was all staged?

422
00:50:33,563 --> 00:50:34,860
Unless he's God.

423
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:37,630
It'll be a perfect crime!

424
00:50:38,402 --> 00:50:39,426
We're

425
00:50:41,938 --> 00:50:43,803
going to Jakarta.

426
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:46,675
Why Jakarta?

427
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:52,774
You don't know what it means,

428
00:50:53,183 --> 00:50:54,810
and you call yourself a robber?

429
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:59,253
Here, Jakarta is slang,
meaning the perfect crime.

430
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:05,454
I asked to see if you knew.
How could I not know it?

431
00:51:05,662 --> 00:51:09,428
We're going to Jakarta!
Right?

432
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:14,728
They come to work at 7:30.

433
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,600
They open it at 9.

434
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:28,216
That's when SECOME gets turned off.

435
00:51:32,622 --> 00:51:34,988
At 9:10,
the vault is open.

436
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:45,692
At 9:15,
we'll run into the bank.

437
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:50,571
This is our plan.
Dig it?

438
00:51:51,775 --> 00:51:53,970
It sounds too easy.

439
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:57,671
Even kindergartners can do it.

440
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:02,713
Every perfect plan is simple.

441
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,888
That's how most scumbags
end up in jail.

442
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,455
You have to jinx it?

443
00:52:31,448 --> 00:52:32,710
Doo san?

444
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:37,449
You never hit the mark.
Why don't I do it?

445
00:52:39,389 --> 00:52:44,224
Trust me, bro.
I'm better than you are.

446
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,087
Did you get them?

447
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:26,629
Just one grandma's body.

448
00:53:28,939 --> 00:53:30,600
That will do.

449
00:53:32,108 --> 00:53:33,200
What about male bodies?

450
00:53:34,244 --> 00:53:37,475
Not many men jump lately!

451
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:40,881
the news says a lot of them
jump into the river.

452
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:43,152
the media makes an issue out of it.

453
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:52,257
Now they go to the sea
or take pills, man!

454
00:53:53,496 --> 00:53:55,657
I think I need a new job.

455
00:53:57,601 --> 00:53:59,626
It used to be good, right?

456
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:04,705
That's what I'm saying.

457
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:07,868
2 or 3 a day jumped, man!

458
00:54:09,613 --> 00:54:11,308
I miss those days,

459
00:54:11,848 --> 00:54:15,409
making a few Grand a day.

460
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:23,350
Here.

461
00:54:29,032 --> 00:54:30,397
Give me ten.

462
00:54:32,802 --> 00:54:33,769
No way.

463
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:36,572
Give me ten!

464
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:40,804
Let me do some fishing.
I won't take long.

465
00:54:45,482 --> 00:54:46,813
Not even ten?

466
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:51,982
Son of a bitch!

467
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:19,506
Where are we going?

468
00:55:21,351 --> 00:55:22,716
Where do you want to go?

469
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:27,046
America?
Or Canada?

470
00:55:29,726 --> 00:55:30,920
Switzerland.

471
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:34,857
Okay, we'll go to Switzerland.

472
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:39,262
I'll make a reservation for
two first class tickets.

473
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,336
When's the big day?

474
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:53,781
Tuesday, 9 A.M.

475
00:55:54,117 --> 00:55:55,812
Tuesday, 9 A.M.

476
00:55:56,119 --> 00:55:57,586
Tuesday, 9 A.M.

477
00:56:03,493 --> 00:56:06,621
Shut up and dig with me.

478
00:56:08,932 --> 00:56:10,797
Not enough space.

479
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:14,869
Keep digging.
My legs are falling asleep.

480
00:56:16,339 --> 00:56:18,534
Carry the dirt then.

481
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,837
it's a cop
Drop it.

482
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:54,100
Drop it.

483
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:56,373
Drop it!

484
00:56:57,514 --> 00:56:58,572
Turn off the radio.

485
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:12,986
Hello?

486
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:14,495
Hello?

487
00:57:15,165 --> 00:57:16,257
It's me, Eun-ah.

488
00:57:18,301 --> 00:57:19,632
We just started digging.

489
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,469
It's 9 o'clock sharp.
Don't forget.

490
00:57:23,206 --> 00:57:26,198
I'll turn off SECOME at 9.

491
00:57:27,010 --> 00:57:28,102
9 o'clock sharp.

492
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:31,943
Don't worry about a thing.
It's perfect!

493
00:57:33,883 --> 00:57:35,214
You got a gun?

494
00:57:35,985 --> 00:57:38,579
It's a fake one that they use
for survival games.

495
00:57:39,422 --> 00:57:41,686
Don't worry.
We won't be using it.

496
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:43,650
Don't worry.

497
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:48,763
I'm worried.
What if anything goes wrong?

498
00:57:51,701 --> 00:57:52,861
Plane tickets?

499
00:57:54,337 --> 00:57:57,636
4:10, Wednesday afternoon.
Swiss Airlines.

500
00:57:59,075 --> 00:58:02,670
That's right.
I'll bring them to the office.

501
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:07,741
I'll meet you there at 12
on Tuesday.

502
00:58:57,567 --> 00:58:58,727
Hey, sis.

503
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:06,472
Want some noodles?

504
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:13,073
Reading a traveler's guide?
Aren't you worried?

505
00:59:14,584 --> 00:59:16,381
Worried about what?

506
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,044
We're all set.

507
00:59:20,456 --> 00:59:23,152
You guys are pathetic.

508
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:32,866
We got everything covered.
All we need is a gun.

509
00:59:33,036 --> 00:59:36,199
What?
You haven't gotten one?

510
01:00:08,371 --> 01:00:11,534
What's the matter?

511
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:15,069
Hey, look.

512
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:20,482
Leave me alone.

513
01:00:21,317 --> 01:00:25,219
Do you love him?

514
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:29,755
I see.

515
01:00:31,127 --> 01:00:32,856
You're in love with him.

516
01:00:34,430 --> 01:00:35,954
Listen, girl.

517
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:40,030
He's a married man.

518
01:00:44,607 --> 01:00:49,806
I bet he doesn't love you.

519
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,674
You don't know anything!

520
01:00:59,389 --> 01:01:00,879
Here's what.

521
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:04,184
by any chance...

522
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:05,891
in case of...

523
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:10,064
After Doo-san stabs you,
if he carries you out...

524
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:13,034
I don't think it'll happen, though.

525
01:01:14,404 --> 01:01:16,338
Then you can go with him.

526
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:18,567
What about you guys?

527
01:01:18,741 --> 01:01:21,869
Nobody knows us.
We can score something else.

528
01:01:24,681 --> 01:01:28,048
You're our only sister.
I want the best for you.

529
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:30,912
Hae-ryong-

530
01:02:08,758 --> 01:02:09,782
Money?

531
01:02:11,127 --> 01:02:12,287
Put it on my tab.

532
01:02:12,628 --> 01:02:16,029
Shove it up your ass.
I want cash for it.

533
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:18,394
no guarantee of success

534
01:02:19,368 --> 01:02:20,835
No money, no gun!

535
01:02:24,874 --> 01:02:26,933
Is this a joke or what?

536
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:28,776
It's not a joke.

537
01:02:29,045 --> 01:02:31,172
I said, "Put it on my tab!"

538
01:02:40,356 --> 01:02:43,587
I told you not to play with it.

539
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:46,986
This is cool!

540
01:02:47,063 --> 01:02:48,621
Give it here, bro.
It rocks!

541
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:50,958
You assholes!

542
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:59,333
I said, "No Jokes!"

543
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:44,612
5 minutes left.

544
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:50,021
Will SECOME be off at 9?

545
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:52,117
It will.
Trust me.

546
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:56,056
If it doesn't...

547
01:04:02,672 --> 01:04:04,401
We'll wait until it's off.

548
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:10,106
It's 9.

549
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:17,880
Hello?

550
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:20,681
Okay.

551
01:04:22,391 --> 01:04:23,619
Okay.
This is...

552
01:04:25,127 --> 01:04:28,324
Don't worry about a thing.
We're all set.

553
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:31,122
I'm not sure about this.

554
01:04:31,434 --> 01:04:33,231
Can we pull this off?

555
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:36,762
All set?

556
01:04:37,406 --> 01:04:38,430
Don't worry about it.

557
01:04:38,608 --> 01:04:41,577
I'll walk into the vault
and pick up $3 million.

558
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:43,743
No one will suspect me.

559
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:47,247
Are you sure about that?

560
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:52,982
I'm the VP of the bank.
Who would suspect me?

561
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:56,848
It's 9:08.
I'm going in.

562
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:03,491
Okay, in 7 minutes.

563
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:08,167
We will.

564
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:19,477
Good morning, sir.

565
01:05:21,484 --> 01:05:23,952
Good morning, sir.

566
01:05:26,589 --> 01:05:27,817
Good morning, sir.

567
01:05:33,562 --> 01:05:35,393
- Go ahead, sir.
- What?

568
01:05:35,698 --> 01:05:39,498
Oh, okay.

569
01:05:56,252 --> 01:06:01,349
Oh my God, it's money!

570
01:06:01,991 --> 01:06:04,152
Shake a leg.
We've got 4 minutes left.

571
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:06,528
Get me the fake bills.

572
01:06:07,063 --> 01:06:08,462
What for?

573
01:06:08,664 --> 01:06:10,393
Aren't we leaving them outside?

574
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:12,091
Do as I say!
Time's running out!

575
01:06:15,404 --> 01:06:16,530
Hurry up!

576
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:34,783
Shit!

577
01:07:09,592 --> 01:07:11,082
Hello?
This is a Andong- restaurant

578
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,619
- Hello?
- Police station?

579
01:07:13,796 --> 01:07:16,390
You got the wrong number.
This is a Chinese restaurant.

580
01:07:16,599 --> 01:07:19,363
This is Okwang Investment Bank.
We've got bank robbers!

581
01:07:20,136 --> 01:07:21,728
I told you, lady.

582
01:07:21,804 --> 01:07:24,068
It's a Chinese restaurant!

583
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:26,071
Hurry up!

584
01:07:27,977 --> 01:07:30,002
Is she nuts?

585
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:32,909
She wants me, a delivery boy,
to bust bank robbers?

586
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,541
Hey, you crazy bitch!

587
01:07:36,719 --> 01:07:38,414
No more crank calls!

588
01:08:04,847 --> 01:08:07,179
Now, you bastards!

589
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:12,572
It's so real.

590
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:15,309
Look at this blood.
Where did you get the gun?

591
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:19,412
It rules, man!

592
01:09:19,588 --> 01:09:21,886
- Doesn't it?
- You bet! Here, here.

593
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:29,658
and then...

594
01:09:29,932 --> 01:09:31,832
Do the other arm.
By the way...

595
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:35,392
Why did you hit me that hard?
I didn't want to, man.

596
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:39,304
Hae-ryong told me
it had to look real.

597
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:42,170
No kidding.
I bet it was personal.

598
01:09:42,311 --> 01:09:45,678
It doesn't hurt now, does it?

599
01:09:46,715 --> 01:09:49,809
We'll talk about it later.

600
01:09:50,452 --> 01:09:51,851
Take your shirt!

601
01:09:57,693 --> 01:09:59,957
- So heavy!
- No kidding, man.

602
01:10:10,105 --> 01:10:12,573
Heavier than an alive one!

603
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:14,805
After I take off,
clean up the mess.

604
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:19,176
Put the bodies in the back.

605
01:10:19,281 --> 01:10:21,340
Put it on later.

606
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:29,318
He's scared like a trapped rat!

607
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:25,279
Out of the vehicle, please.

608
01:11:43,666 --> 01:11:44,792
Name?

609
01:11:46,969 --> 01:11:48,129
White.

610
01:11:53,042 --> 01:11:54,134
What are you looking at?

611
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:08,581
Name?

612
01:12:10,693 --> 01:12:13,685
Kim Bong-man!

613
01:12:14,263 --> 01:12:17,198
Kim Bong-man...

614
01:12:17,700 --> 01:12:21,864
Occupation?
bank robber!

615
01:12:22,838 --> 01:12:24,430
it's okay

616
01:12:24,807 --> 01:12:29,073
Way to go, boy.
Polite, humble, honest...

617
01:12:29,745 --> 01:12:32,839
That's the attitude that
criminals like you need.

618
01:12:34,516 --> 01:12:35,642
Occupation....

619
01:12:36,085 --> 01:12:38,645
bank robber....

620
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:40,914
What?

621
01:12:41,256 --> 01:12:42,655
bank robber?

622
01:12:43,726 --> 01:12:45,717
Right, sir!

623
01:12:47,029 --> 01:12:50,362
Didn't he steal a taxi?

624
01:12:58,941 --> 01:13:01,375
Bastards!

625
01:13:02,678 --> 01:13:06,045
Don't worry about it, sir.

626
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:09,543
Go ahead.

627
01:13:10,486 --> 01:13:12,386
I'm on my way.

628
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:16,451
Sir, won't it be better
if you call the cops?

629
01:13:16,792 --> 01:13:18,885
I can't trust them.

630
01:13:19,628 --> 01:13:21,289
I got everything figured out.

631
01:13:21,864 --> 01:13:25,265
Detectives are here to see you, sir.

632
01:14:35,170 --> 01:14:38,901
What?

633
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:43,840
Okay, let them in.

634
01:14:51,553 --> 01:14:52,679
Yes?

635
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:04,563
Have a seat.

636
01:15:05,868 --> 01:15:07,495
We're from Kangnam Station.

637
01:15:10,072 --> 01:15:13,064
What's this about?

638
01:15:13,375 --> 01:15:18,438
We busted a perpetrator who
tried to rob your bank.

639
01:15:19,681 --> 01:15:23,640
What are you talking bout?

640
01:15:24,453 --> 01:15:29,584
The attempted bank robbery
took place at 9 this morning.

641
01:15:30,592 --> 01:15:34,790
Well, I have no idea

642
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:38,089
what you're talking about.

643
01:15:40,435 --> 01:15:41,629
in that case

644
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:46,173
You didn't know your bank
was robbed this morning?

645
01:15:47,743 --> 01:15:50,211
I talked to some people,
and they confirmed it.

646
01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:55,878
I don't think so.

647
01:15:56,485 --> 01:16:01,218
How could I not know
if such a thing happened?

648
01:16:04,726 --> 01:16:05,784
Is that right?

649
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:15,226
I told you.
That asshole is a nutcase!

650
01:16:19,675 --> 01:16:22,007
Thanks for your time.

651
01:16:22,511 --> 01:16:25,071
No problem.

652
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:28,108
We're leaving.

653
01:16:28,483 --> 01:16:31,247
Thanks for your concern.

654
01:16:37,526 --> 01:16:42,156
It was never robbed?

655
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:45,996
- That's right.
- Okay.

656
01:16:52,140 --> 01:16:54,870
Yes, sir?

657
01:16:55,143 --> 01:16:58,909
Who would deposit their money
to the bank that gets robbed?

658
01:17:06,822 --> 01:17:12,522
Doo-san, throw it well.
Don't kill our little sister.

659
01:17:26,508 --> 01:17:27,839
Eun-ah!

660
01:17:29,044 --> 01:17:31,410
Eun-ah!

661
01:19:00,769 --> 01:19:03,294
Help me carry the bodies!

662
01:19:04,372 --> 01:19:06,897
Hae-ryong,
sprinkle the gasoline!

663
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:19,778
Eun-ah,

664
01:19:20,055 --> 01:19:23,354
didn't I tell you

665
01:19:23,792 --> 01:19:26,022
he would use you?

666
01:19:26,294 --> 01:19:29,991
Had I not used Red to be in it,
you would've gotten screwed.

667
01:19:30,198 --> 01:19:32,758
That's enough.

668
01:19:33,068 --> 01:19:36,196
Stop crying.

669
01:19:36,338 --> 01:19:37,566
Let's carry the bodies.

670
01:21:47,969 --> 01:21:52,133
What happened?
Where the hell were you?

671
01:21:55,944 --> 01:21:57,434
You look like shit.

672
01:21:58,880 --> 01:22:00,370
Is this blood?

673
01:22:00,482 --> 01:22:03,042
Not mine.
It's a long story.

674
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:05,678
I didn't expect it to be
this complicated.

675
01:22:06,288 --> 01:22:07,346
What about the money?

676
01:22:14,663 --> 01:22:17,632
- Let me see some dollars.
- Sure.

677
01:22:23,438 --> 01:22:26,669
This is all ours?

678
01:22:28,476 --> 01:22:30,842
Yeah, it's all ours.

679
01:22:32,714 --> 01:22:34,238
Good job, guys.

680
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:37,612
How much is this?

681
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:41,111
3 million dollars.

682
01:22:42,524 --> 01:22:44,958
We've got great lives
ahead of us.

683
01:22:47,996 --> 01:22:51,864
Give me a fag, bro.

684
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:28,998
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

685
01:24:11,613 --> 01:24:13,547
- Hi.
- How are you?

686
01:24:15,617 --> 01:24:18,177
These are for Jakarta.

687
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:21,879
You should go over to
Indonesian Airlines.

688
01:24:23,925 --> 01:24:26,052
You must be kidding.

689
01:24:26,161 --> 01:24:31,463
They're for Switzerland.

690
01:24:33,401 --> 01:24:34,527
Look here, mister.

691
01:24:36,271 --> 01:24:42,506
It says Jakarta here.
'J, A, K, A, R, T, A'

692
01:24:52,487 --> 01:24:55,581
How could this happen?

693
01:24:55,690 --> 01:24:59,626
I bought them for Switzerland!

694
01:24:59,828 --> 01:25:03,457
I didn't issue tickets.
Why are you yelling at me?

695
01:25:03,665 --> 01:25:06,190
If you've got any complaints,
go to the information desk.

696
01:25:06,234 --> 01:25:10,967
I've come to you.
You should take care of us.

697
01:25:11,005 --> 01:25:14,065
I didn't issue those tickets.

698
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:18,671
- Come on.
- It's your fault!

699
01:25:18,746 --> 01:25:22,739
- Let me talk to you, girl.
- Is she the right one?

700
01:25:23,218 --> 01:25:27,154
Gosh, you're killing me!
I have to go to Switzerland!

701
01:25:27,689 --> 01:25:31,523
No way I'm going to Jakarta.
I'm going to Switzerland!

702
01:25:31,726 --> 01:25:34,820
We can go to Jakarta first

703
01:25:34,896 --> 01:25:37,330
and over to Switzerland.

704
01:25:55,483 --> 01:25:57,178
Where are we going
when we get there?

705
01:25:59,521 --> 01:26:00,647
It's a surprise.

706
01:26:01,322 --> 01:26:05,122
- That's why dad hated you!
- Give me a break, man!

707
01:26:43,064 --> 01:26:44,088
Who the hell are you?

708
01:26:44,232 --> 01:26:47,133
You're under arrest
for using counterfeit bills.

709
01:26:51,973 --> 01:26:54,737
What counterfeit bills?
You're making a big mistake.

710
01:26:54,943 --> 01:26:57,912
- Uncuff me!
- Shut up!

711
01:27:04,986 --> 01:27:09,116
There must be a mix-up.

712
01:27:15,597 --> 01:27:18,259
What are we doing now?

713
01:27:19,500 --> 01:27:23,129
We're going to Jakarta.

714
01:27:24,172 --> 01:27:27,471
- Jakarta that is!
- Let's go!

715
01:27:57,705 --> 01:27:59,639
It's very simple.

716
01:28:00,241 --> 01:28:03,472
We put dead bodies there
and blow up the gas pipe.

717
01:28:03,544 --> 01:28:09,483
The police will think we're dead.

718
01:28:09,784 --> 01:28:12,378
I'll be a perfect crime!

719
01:28:13,554 --> 01:28:16,819
Then we're going to Ja...

720
01:28:20,561 --> 01:28:22,893
We're going to Jamaica!
