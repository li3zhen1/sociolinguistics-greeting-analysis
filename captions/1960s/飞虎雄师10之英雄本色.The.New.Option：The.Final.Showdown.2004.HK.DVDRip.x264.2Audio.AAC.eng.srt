My son Jason knows

...how good l am to you

8
00:00:26,726 --> 00:00:28,193
Don`t use Jason to blackmail me

9
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:32,690
To be honest, l won`t

10
00:00:32,899 --> 00:00:34,890
...live long enough to protect you

11
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:40,129
Jason, do you have the tape?

Yes, l have it

13
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:52,916
You are under my control

14
00:01:07,867 --> 00:01:11,428
Son, l know who killed you

15
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:14,670
l will revenge your death

16
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:44,863
Mom, are you feeling better now?

17
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,393
l feel much relieved now

18
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:50,199
...that you have grown up

19
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:55,067
Mom, what is wrong with my brother?

20
00:02:55,742 --> 00:02:57,369
No, nothing

21
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,471
Tell me what`s wrong

22
00:03:03,449 --> 00:03:04,882

23
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:07,009

25
00:03:08,788 --> 00:03:09,846
0ne night

26
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,114

...l went to buy them food

28
00:03:14,894 --> 00:03:17,692
When l was downstairs

29
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,499
l went back home

30
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,498
l saw your brother holding a gun
in his hand

31
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,194
He has killed the man!

32
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,403
Mom, we have to report this
to the police

33
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:30,338
No, we can`t do that

34
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,511
You brother said it will ruin him

35
00:03:32,679 --> 00:03:34,613
Who`s that man?

36
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:36,671
That man`s called...

00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:38,976

00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,411
Jason?

39
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:41,613
Who`s he?

40
00:03:41,821 --> 00:03:43,652
Son of a triad society boss

41
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:45,915
So what should we do?

42
00:03:46,459 --> 00:03:47,187
We are in big trouble!

43
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:49,258
Mom, l will talk to Madam. We will
think of something

44
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,629
What`s the matter?

45
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:54,331
Mom, don`t be afraid!

46
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,660

Mom, stay calm

49
00:05:40,473 --> 00:05:46,434
What`s the matter? Get the phone?

50
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:48,705
Phone, phone, phone

51
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:53,979
Quick

52
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:00,684
Hey

53
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,124
Hey, brother, there is someone
in our house

54
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,958
What? Don`t open the door

55
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,095
BiBi, dial 999

56
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:13,295
Call the police

57
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:03,454
What`s happened?

58
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:04,784
Sir, a fire has broken out

59
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:05,423
Which unit?

60
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:06,421
13th floor

61
00:07:08,795 --> 00:07:25,577
Mom, BiBi, Mom, BiBi. Let me in

62
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:27,569
You can`t go in. lt`s too dangerous

63
00:07:27,814 --> 00:07:30,009
Calm down

64
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:11,074
Hon, why do l have to do that?

65
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:14,851
My son was burnt into
a piece of black coal

66
00:09:15,054 --> 00:09:18,319
There was a bullet inside his body

67
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,826
l can`t sleep after his death

68
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:24,222
lt is fair that...

69
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,955
Someone should suffer
the same pain as l have

70
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,163
Fatso, what do you want?

71
00:09:30,303 --> 00:09:32,271
l like your toughness

72
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:33,233
l`ll ask you to accompany me

73
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:34,632
...should there be an accident

74
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:42,469
Damn you. Let me get out of the car

75
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:23,776
Are you Piano?

76
00:11:24,083 --> 00:11:25,015
Yes, Auntie

77
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:26,844
David often talks about you

78
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,317

come to see you

79
00:11:30,256 --> 00:11:32,656

l am very happy to meet you today

81
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:37,824
A fire has broken out in a unit at

82
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,657
...Kwun Tong 18 Hong Lee Road
13th floor

83
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:40,490
Do you want to watch TV?

84
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,530
Yes

85
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:42,933
l turn it louder

86
00:11:43,569 --> 00:11:46,333
The police suspects arson

87
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,801
We also have Hong Kong news here

88
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:52,235
...only delayed

89
00:11:55,347 --> 00:11:58,214
lt`s impossible. lt can`t be real

90
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:03,548
They are my friends

91
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:05,422
What`s happened?

92
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,788
Auntie, l have to go now

93
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:10,085
Piano, aren`t you staying here?

94
00:12:10,296 --> 00:12:11,263
l have to return to Hong Kong

95
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:26,411
Come in, Hon

96
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:35,917
What`s the matter, Madam?

97
00:12:37,289 --> 00:12:38,415
Why do you still come back to the office

98
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,284
Why shouldn`t l?

99
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:43,661
l think you need a rest

100
00:12:45,197 --> 00:12:47,495
l am okay, Madam. l don`t need a rest

101
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,198
l won`t let an emotionally
unstable person

102
00:12:51,437 --> 00:12:53,302
...walking around on the street
with a gun

103
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,236
Madam, l am okay

104
00:12:58,444 --> 00:12:59,536
Why must l take leave?

105
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:04,577
Hand in your gun and your pass

106
00:13:05,017 --> 00:13:06,450
Go and see the psychologist

107
00:13:06,685 --> 00:13:08,414
lf he says you are fine

108
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:10,121
...then l`ll let you come back
to work at once

109
00:13:11,690 --> 00:13:13,157
lt`s not fair

110
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:14,785
lt`s an order

111
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,005
Everyone-get back to work

112
00:14:00,105 --> 00:14:01,697
Mr. Hon, take it easy! Don`t feel so bad

113
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:06,838
Mom, BiBi, l will revenge your death

114
00:14:58,964 --> 00:15:01,524
So, are you feeling depressed?

115
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,694
Take it easy!

116
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:07,333
Tonight you will sleep soundly

117
00:15:07,973 --> 00:15:09,372
0f course l will sleep well

118
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:11,799
l hope you do too

119
00:15:12,044 --> 00:15:13,477
...so that you can dream of your son

120
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,946
Yes, l have dreamed of my son

121
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:18,582
My son told me that

122
00:15:18,784 --> 00:15:21,252
...you will not have any heirs

123
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:23,145
That`s good

124
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:26,056
Please tell your son tonight that

125
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,187
...his dad will come to see him
very soon

126
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:31,022
Fine. And when l was there

127
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,358
...l would also tell your mother
and sister that

128
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:36,500
...they would have their family
reunion very soon

129
00:15:37,503 --> 00:15:38,595
May your wish come true!

130
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,283
Come in

131
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:31,583
Have you finished your work?

132
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:37,820
What`s the matter? You look unhappy

133
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:38,993
How do you know?

134
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,058
J ust by looking at you

135
00:16:42,401 --> 00:16:44,369
Hon lost his temper today

136
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,330
...when l asked him to take leave

137
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:48,371
Why?

138
00:16:49,975 --> 00:16:50,532
You know his mother and BiBi

139
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:52,643
...had just passed away

140
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,437
l was afraid he was
emotionally unstable

141
00:16:54,646 --> 00:16:57,308
...so l asked him to take leave

142
00:16:58,050 --> 00:16:59,483
He has too much on his mind

143
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:05,719
Don`t worry too much

144
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,782
l`ll dine with you tonight

145
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,021

Relax

147
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,565
Madam, these were

148
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,005

149
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,007
Thank you

150
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:27,003

155
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,278
l did not expect you to be
so good looking

156
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,248
Cut the crap. Please go back
to the station with us

157

...concerning the murder
of the female reporter

159
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,460
What`s your relationship with Hon Gin?

160
00:18:49,261 --> 00:18:52,321
Hon Gin, he`s a cop

161
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:53,861
l have no relationship whatsoever
with cops

162
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:57,734
Fatso, Madam is asking you a question

163
00:18:58,270 --> 00:18:59,498
Stop cracking jokes!

164
00:19:00,639 --> 00:19:03,073
Sir, don`t shout at me

165
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:05,937
l am old-l can`t stand loud noises!

166
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:09,041
Lynn was a female reporter from CBN

167
00:19:09,314 --> 00:19:10,645
She shot you dining with Hon Gin

168
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:13,716
...in a restaurant in Kowloon City

169
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:15,008
What were you talking about?

170
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:20,049
l remember that incident now
that you mention it

171
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,456
That night...

172
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:23,490
They pointed their cameras at me

173
00:19:23,695 --> 00:19:26,186
Well, Madam, there are

174
00:19:26,431 --> 00:19:27,227
...many restaurants in that mansion

175
00:19:27,432 --> 00:19:30,401
How can you say l dined with Hon?

176
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,728
Don`t try to fool us Fatso

177
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:33,494
Everybody knows that...

178
00:19:33,705 --> 00:19:35,297
...you own all the restaurants
in that building

179
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:38,575
Yes, l own all the restaurants

180
00:19:38,777 --> 00:19:40,267
Can l refuse Hon

181
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:44,438
...to dine in one of them?

182
00:19:44,783 --> 00:19:47,343
Fatso, we just want to know

183
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,521
...if you meet with Hon Gin frequently

184
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:52,121
Madam, who do you think l am
a rookie?

185
00:19:52,324 --> 00:19:56,488
Even if l am, l won`t say so

186
00:19:58,997 --> 00:20:00,794
He`s going around in circles

187
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:03,125
The bosses of triad societies
are like that

188
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:05,532
But Madam, do you suspect
our Boss...?

189
00:20:05,938 --> 00:20:08,429
There are the tapes and
material evidence

190
00:20:08,774 --> 00:20:10,071
...on quite a few murders to which
l can not be blind

191
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,300
But you will get married two days later

192
00:20:12,477 --> 00:20:13,671
...let us handle the case

193
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:14,903
Yes, let us handle it

194
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:15,910
Yeah

195
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,176
Lock him up for 24 hours
then discharge him

196
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:19,975
...and follow him around the clock

197
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:21,141
0kay, we will

198
00:21:52,811 --> 00:22:00,809
lnspector, why are you here?

199
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:02,980
l haven`t sold guns for a long time

200
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:06,582
Whatever happened has
nothing to do with me

201
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:08,586
Don`t lie to me

202
00:22:09,127 --> 00:22:10,856
l know what you have been doing

203
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,628
lf so, arrest me!

204
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,395
l need a gun

205
00:22:18,437 --> 00:22:19,927
Are you kidding?

206
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:22,001
A cop wants to buy a gun from me?

207
00:22:23,208 --> 00:22:25,676
l am not a cop anymore
and l need a gun

208
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:29,278
Sir, aren`t you holding a gun
in your hand?

209
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:31,072
l need one more

210
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:32,810
Do you understand me?

211
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:35,417
Yes, yes

212
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:42,900
Little Dog, what have you got?

213
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:43,760
The cop has taken our bait

214
00:26:44,002 --> 00:26:45,492
We have cornered him into a room

215
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:47,228
He`s got two guns

216
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:48,561
l know he will come one day

217
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,173
Why would he need another gun?

218
00:26:50,508 --> 00:26:52,032
Take him alive

219
00:26:52,243 --> 00:26:53,870
Shoot him on sight and then

220
00:26:54,079 --> 00:26:55,910
...throw his dead body in the
reclamation area

221
00:26:56,815 --> 00:26:59,579
0h no, let me take a look at his corpse

222
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:00,978
...before you dispose of it

223
00:27:04,889 --> 00:27:05,981
Now you can see me

224
00:27:06,825 --> 00:27:09,760
Hon, this is a public place

225
00:27:15,166 --> 00:27:17,691
Fatso, don`t bullshit me!

226
00:27:19,904 --> 00:27:21,565
l`ll give you 3 million to get away
from Hong Kong

227
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,173
l guarantee you will be safe

228
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,307
You think too highly of me

229
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:30,172
l only want justice to be done

230
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:33,408
What are you doing?

231
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:34,914
Waiting for ``Sheung Tau``!

232
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:37,148
What`s ``Sheung Tau``?

233
00:27:38,056 --> 00:27:38,681
You know

234
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:41,653
...the elderly use a comb
to brush the hair!

235
00:27:43,595 --> 00:27:45,620
You probably can`t understand this

236
00:27:47,265 --> 00:27:49,028
Aren`t you staying with your boys?

237
00:27:49,467 --> 00:27:51,662
No, l am now having a drink

238
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:54,338
...with Sir Chow

239
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,338
Quick. Hang up the phone!

240
00:27:56,541 --> 00:27:57,473
You are so long.winded!

241
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:58,698
Do you hear that?

242
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:00,804
Tell her to shut up

243
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,377
Go and take a bath

244
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:06,209
We don`t have much time

245
00:28:06,418 --> 00:28:07,282
Quick

246
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:10,917
Do you hear that? l`ll go now, bye

247
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:15,424
You are a grown.up now

248
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:18,456
Cheers

249
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:22,098
Don`t yell

250
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:23,391
You have so many ideas

251
00:28:23,601 --> 00:28:28,595
My dear cousin, you better be quick

252
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:29,603
Wear your shoes and pajamas...

253
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:31,331
And have your hair combed

254
00:28:38,616 --> 00:28:39,173
Hey

255
00:28:39,417 --> 00:28:40,611

00:28:44,489 --> 00:28:45,683
What`s wrong?

260
00:28:47,525 --> 00:28:48,549
l`ll wait for you downstairs

Please come down by yourself
and don`t tell anyone

Hey, Stone

266
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,641
...tomorrow you will no longer
be a bachelor

267
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:14,318
Cheers

268
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:16,282
Cheers

269
00:29:17,021 --> 00:29:21,424
Someone must be on duty

270
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:23,593
Stone, take it easy

271
00:29:23,928 --> 00:29:26,488
Big Wei, Big Guy, Frankie and Ah Sun

We are free today

274
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:33,897
Tonight is your last night as a bachelor

275
00:29:34,105 --> 00:29:36,539
We`re going to have a great time!

276
00:29:39,410 --> 00:29:40,172
Do you still remember

277
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:41,675
...Madam Ann?

278
00:29:41,846 --> 00:29:43,211
We do

279
00:29:43,414 --> 00:29:44,381
She is your wife, right?

280
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:45,708
But l have to go home

281
00:29:45,950 --> 00:29:46,917
This has nothing to do with you

282
00:29:47,418 --> 00:29:48,885
You don`t have to be afraid of her

283
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:49,883
You don`t have to

284
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:50,780
What?

285
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:51,545
But l am afraid of her

286
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:52,779
lf she kicks you out of your house
we`ll let you in

287
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:54,222
We will support you

288
00:29:54,425 --> 00:29:54,891
That`s right

289
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:55,687
Yes, Luk Kam Choi

290
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,292
What`s the matter?

291
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:56,983
Where`s your program?

292
00:29:57,061 --> 00:29:58,255
Yeah, it`s your turn

293
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,761
Where are you going?

294
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:02,626
Hey, listen to me, listen well

295
00:30:02,734 --> 00:30:05,032
Madam Ann will keep a
close watch on me

296
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:06,362
What are you afraid of?

297
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:09,904
This is our small present to you

298
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:12,668
Look

00:30:35,567 --> 00:30:36,397
What is it for?

301
00:30:37,368 --> 00:30:39,893
0K, you have your fun

302
00:30:40,138 --> 00:30:42,663
Hey, l`ve got to answer the phone

303
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:47,476
You should not behave like this

304
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:51,709
Let me tell you that

305
00:30:52,650 --> 00:30:54,447
...l`d appreciate your lust for life

306
00:30:55,553 --> 00:30:56,577
Well, c`est la vie, as they say

307
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:57,720
We have to look ahead

308
00:30:57,922 --> 00:30:59,412
...and remain positive always

309
00:31:01,593 --> 00:31:03,561
l would prefer it was me who got shot

310
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:06,463
lt has nothing to do with you

311
00:31:08,032 --> 00:31:12,696
Did you see who shot you that night?

312
00:31:13,271 --> 00:31:15,102
lt was too dark. l couldn`t see clearly
l was just careless

313
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:17,408
Can you forget something like this?

314
00:31:18,309 --> 00:31:19,936
Let`s not talk about unhappy memories

315
00:31:20,178 --> 00:31:22,612
Today we should be happy

316
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,111
0kay

317
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:38,058
Madam, please get in the car

318
00:31:39,497 --> 00:31:41,727
Put down your gun first. Be calm

319
00:31:42,133 --> 00:31:45,864
Now l trust you only. Get in the car

320
00:31:57,248 --> 00:31:58,681
l have been a cop for over 10 years

321
00:31:59,484 --> 00:32:02,681
l am a good cop. l don`t deserve this

322
00:32:02,954 --> 00:32:05,684
From now on

323
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:09,758
...l`ll do things my way

324
00:32:13,097 --> 00:32:14,189
Do you know this would mean that

325
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:15,456
...you are going down a road
of no return?

326
00:32:15,867 --> 00:32:18,768
l know. l can`t turn back now

327
00:32:23,574 --> 00:32:24,666
Can l answer the phone?

328
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,577
Please do

329
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:35,945
Hey

330
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:38,682
Madam, Hon had kidnapped Fatso

331
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:40,990
Yes, l know

332
00:32:41,893 --> 00:32:44,862
Madam, sorry, start driving

333
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:49,197
Where is Fatso?

334
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:52,602
l`ll force him to tell you the whole truth

335
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:54,303
Please be my witness

336
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:02,169
Hon, if you trust me, l`ll go with you

337
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:03,677
...but put down your gun first

338
00:33:04,415 --> 00:33:05,439
Start driving!

339
00:33:21,799 --> 00:33:22,857
Maybe it`s Madam Ann

340
00:33:23,568 --> 00:33:26,162
No, it`s Ling Ling. Sorry

341
00:33:28,139 --> 00:33:30,972
Stone, Ann gets in Hon`s car

342
00:33:31,175 --> 00:33:32,608
She has not yet returned

343
00:33:32,710 --> 00:33:37,272
What? This means trouble

344
00:33:37,482 --> 00:33:40,417
Let`s go

345
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:42,380
Go...

346
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:50,485
0pen the door

347
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,087
Then go inside this room

348
00:35:59,323 --> 00:36:02,850
Yes. Man

349
00:36:03,427 --> 00:36:06,123
...a traffic cop found the boss` car
in Kowloon City

350
00:36:06,297 --> 00:36:07,127
A newspaper man

351
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:09,265
...saw Madam and Boss
enter a building

352
00:36:10,234 --> 00:36:13,032
Go and get ready

353
00:36:19,777 --> 00:36:21,745
Stone, this is Man Sai from 0CTB

354
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:23,973
Someone saw Hon Gin
and Madam Ann

355
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:25,444
...enter a building in Kowloon City

356
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,140
We`re leaving in 10 minutes

357
00:36:27,718 --> 00:36:30,881
Hon Gin had kidnapped Madam Ann

358
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:32,055
Get ready for action

359
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:33,483
We don`t have any order

360
00:36:33,758 --> 00:36:34,725
You`d stay behind

361
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:35,924
What should we do, Sir?

362
00:36:36,093 --> 00:36:36,491
What should we do, Sir?

363
00:36:36,561 --> 00:36:37,050
What should we do, Sir?

364
00:36:37,261 --> 00:36:38,091
He`s our Chief-do as you are told!

365
00:36:38,296 --> 00:36:39,194
Yes, Sir

366
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:40,486

00:36:40,798 --> 00:36:41,162
Yes

368
00:36:41,399 --> 00:36:42,161
Tell the PTU

369
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:43,389
...to fall in downstairs 10 minutes later

370
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:44,432
0kay

00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:48,998
Madam, today l will force this old fox

...to tell you the truth

373
00:36:53,110 --> 00:36:55,078
Hon, don`t force me

374
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:57,577
Though we are living
in two different worlds

375
00:36:57,882 --> 00:36:59,975
...l have always been good to you and

376
00:37:00,184 --> 00:37:01,981
...treated you like my own son

377
00:37:02,186 --> 00:37:04,416
No more bullshit. Tell Madam the truth

378
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:09,526
Fatso, tell me everything

379
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:15,223
ln fact, Hon murdered
the female reporter

380
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:16,297
What the hell are you saying?

381
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,298
l quarreled with my son for this

382
00:37:20,504 --> 00:37:22,267
...and then he killed my son too

383
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:25,673
You are lying. Speak the truth

384
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:28,504
Madam, will you tell him

385
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:32,648
...not to be so stubborn and repent

386
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:36,176
Listen, if you don`t speak the truth

387
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:38,378
l will blow up your brain

388
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:40,581
This is the truth!

389
00:37:40,791 --> 00:37:42,053
You force me to tell the truth

390
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,498

...he even shot his colleague

399
00:38:12,523 --> 00:38:15,390
Who still stayed in the hospital

400
00:38:18,396 --> 00:38:19,954
lt is you who shot Lucky Lun?

401
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:22,397
Damn you

402
00:38:25,569 --> 00:38:26,536
You shot him

403
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:01,868
Put two men in the street corner

404
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:03,267
The others stay at the back

405
00:39:03,441 --> 00:39:04,373
Joe, come with me

Did you shoot Lucky Lun?

410
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:27,726
Madam, l don`t want that to happen

411
00:39:28,466 --> 00:39:29,694
l feel guilty

412
00:39:31,769 --> 00:39:32,827
Then it`s you

413
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:38,605
l promised Lucky Lun

414
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:41,201
...that l will be a good cop

415
00:39:43,681 --> 00:39:52,680
...but now l have to admit that
l am too ambitious

416
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:55,853
But l didn`t kill that female reporter

417
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:58,756
Jason murdered her

418
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,189
But you scum, you murdered my son

419
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,332

...burnt my mother and my sister
to death

422
00:40:08,005 --> 00:40:10,303
They died a horrible death

423
00:40:12,143 --> 00:40:16,341
l have told you that we shall die together

424
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:22,652
Hon, calm down. Put your gun away

425
00:40:23,621 --> 00:40:25,612

426
00:40:26,457 --> 00:40:28,425

...to know that this scum has ruined me

442
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:24,204
Who do you think you are-Andy Lau?

443
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:26,070
Will the media come
when you made a call?

444
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,208
Shut up! You rogue!

445
00:42:27,378 --> 00:42:28,072
Hon

446
00:42:33,617 --> 00:42:35,084

00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:37,773
Will you let her meet Hon?

491

0kay, bring her up

492
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:42,148

What kind of tricks are you playing?

498
00:49:12,015 --> 00:49:13,073
l didn`t ask her to come

499
00:49:16,420 --> 00:49:17,512
Hon

500
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:19,613
lf you didn`t call her

501
00:49:19,823 --> 00:49:21,085
...how come she`s here?

502
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:23,456
Listen to me, Hon

503
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:25,025
Don`t be stupid!

513
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:40,360
Jason, can you see this?

514
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:43,164
Can you hear this?

515
00:50:48,011 --> 00:50:50,673
Hon`s girlfriend is dead

516
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:38,418
Tell them to put down all their guns

517
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:53,865

00:54:49,486 --> 00:54:50,384
Madam

529
00:54:51,521 --> 00:54:52,453
Hon Gin

530
00:54:54,324 --> 00:54:56,258

532
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:15,901
Hon, you are a good guy!

533
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:29,816
Don`t feel so sad

l feel terrible

535
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,917
Don`t be silly. This is over

536
00:56:38,161 --> 00:56:39,458
Put it out of your mind

537
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:41,655
l am not as strong as you

538
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:45,125
l am not fit for this job

539
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:51,934
No matter what happens
you`ll have my support

540
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:58,602
Hey, how do l look today?

541
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:03,272
You are not as handsome as me
but you look okay

542
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,471
Have confidence in yourself
and then you`ll be fine

543
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:07,414
l should feel happy

544
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:10,678
...since this is my wedding day

545
00:58:10,887 --> 00:58:14,084
...but l just feel strange

546
00:58:14,290 --> 00:58:15,052
There should be three couples

547
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:17,623
...now only one is left!

548
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:20,819
Recently, l have come to a conclusion

549
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:22,725
ln life, what is yours will
eventually be yours

550
00:58:23,132 --> 00:58:24,724
What is not yours you will never get

551
00:58:24,934 --> 00:58:26,993
You`ve got to look ahead

552
00:58:27,203 --> 00:58:28,329
...and take it easy

553
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:29,663
Hey, thank you

554
00:58:31,774 --> 00:58:32,672
Here comes the bride

555
01:01:31,721 --> 01:01:32,983
You`ve got no sense of direction

556
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:34,746
l am much better now

557
01:01:34,957 --> 01:01:36,948
But l have to quit the SDU

558
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:38,457
...since l have to go to Canada

559
01:01:38,761 --> 01:01:39,625
Really?

560
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:41,690
l told him to quit

561
01:01:41,864 --> 01:01:43,092
We`ll open a restaurant in Canada

562
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:45,525
What`s so bad about the SDU?

563
01:01:45,968 --> 01:01:47,230
What is so good about being
a member of the SDU?

564
01:01:47,403 --> 01:01:49,701
You can`t get a wife

565
01:01:49,772 --> 01:01:51,637
Hey, Ann...

566
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:56,037
My dad is like a stone

567
01:01:56,245 --> 01:01:57,678
l hope you don`t mind him

568
01:01:58,214 --> 01:01:59,613
l`ll kiss you for him

569
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:02,144
This bouquet is for you

570
01:02:02,318 --> 01:02:04,183
Wish you get married soon!

571
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:05,978
You still act like a kid

572
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:07,087
...even though you are a grown.up

573
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:19,058
The SDU will welcome you back

574
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:21,727
...once you`ve recovered

575
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:24,132
l can report to duty any time

576
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:28,308
Ann is over there

577
01:02:29,545 --> 01:02:31,274
l don`t know what you`re talking about

578
01:02:31,948 --> 01:02:32,915
lf you don`t go there now

579
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:34,706
...l will punish you run 50 lapses

580
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,714
...do 100 sit.ups, and 100 push.ups

581
01:02:38,988 --> 01:02:40,012
0kay

582
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:41,117
Then go

583
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:41,984
Thank you

584
01:02:42,258 --> 01:02:42,952
Come on

585
01:02:43,126 --> 01:02:44,024
0kay

586
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,873
Ann, l always regard you

587
01:03:06,082 --> 01:03:08,016
...as an outstanding police officer

588
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:10,582
lt`s not easy for a woman

589
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:12,982
...to be in your position

590
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:14,989
l hope you will re.consider

591
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:18,284
...your resignation

592
01:03:19,562 --> 01:03:22,122
Madam, a lot of things happened

593
01:03:22,331 --> 01:03:24,196
...in my department these few months

594
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:26,931
...especially Hon Gin`s case

595
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:29,471
l need a break

596
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:34,669
l am sorry about Hon Gin

597
01:03:35,211 --> 01:03:36,906
But l will feel bad...

598
01:03:37,146 --> 01:03:38,511
lf you leave the police force too

599
01:03:40,049 --> 01:03:42,108
lf l stay most probably l have to

600
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:45,218
...see the psychiatrist everyday

601
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:47,889
l think this is not fair to the force?

602
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,852
What`s your plan?

603
01:03:54,964 --> 01:03:57,091
l plan to go back to school in the States

604
01:03:59,001 --> 01:04:02,903
Will you come back to the police force?

605
01:04:03,472 --> 01:04:05,235
lf l get my degree

606
01:04:05,408 --> 01:04:06,500
l may come back

607
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:09,835
0kay, then

608
01:04:10,446 --> 01:04:13,108
Do you mind if l ask you
a personal question?

609
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,216
Aren`t you getting married with Stone?

610
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:21,485
He`s a good man

611
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:24,554
l always trust your instinct

612
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:26,192
l wish you happiness

613
01:04:26,896 --> 01:04:27,885
Thank you Madam

614
01:04:29,465 --> 01:04:32,332
l have handed in my resignation
to Madam So today

615
01:04:33,803 --> 01:04:34,667
Why?

616
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:38,733
l want to study psychology in the States

617
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:40,971
Aren`t we getting married?

618
01:04:42,144 --> 01:04:45,079
We can live in the States

619
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:47,272
We can study and get married there

620
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:50,986
What? But all my friends are here

621
01:04:51,153 --> 01:04:54,418
...Joe, Bill, they are all here

622
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:58,424
0nly you and l are getting married

623
01:04:59,128 --> 01:05:00,356
What has that got to do with them?

624
01:05:01,330 --> 01:05:03,855
The Chinese loves a party

625
01:05:04,066 --> 01:05:06,432
lt will be more fun. Why?

626
01:05:06,636 --> 01:05:07,568
l am not happy

627
01:05:08,871 --> 01:05:09,769
Why?

628
01:05:11,807 --> 01:05:12,603
l want to leave Hong Kong

629
01:05:12,842 --> 01:05:14,366
...after all that have happened

630
01:05:14,543 --> 01:05:15,567
Do you understand me?

631
01:05:19,282 --> 01:05:24,310
What can l say if this is what you want?

632
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:29,350
What am l supposed to do?

633
01:05:32,194 --> 01:05:33,957
You stay calm even when

634
01:05:34,163 --> 01:05:35,755
...someone points an AK 47 at you

635
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:37,795
...but you lose your cool over a woman

636
01:05:39,135 --> 01:05:45,131
l am a gwai lo. l am different from you

637
01:05:45,408 --> 01:05:46,568
That`s right

638
01:05:47,043 --> 01:05:49,204
Ann is going to a foreign country

639
01:05:49,412 --> 01:05:50,276
...and that suits you

640
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:55,650
lf l leave, what will happen to the boys?

641
01:05:58,187 --> 01:06:00,621
0ne day you have to retire
from the SDU

642
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:04,017
Do yourself a favour

643
01:06:04,226 --> 01:06:06,888
Collect your pension and
go to the States

644
01:06:07,096 --> 01:06:10,224
...stay with Ann

645
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:12,728
They are still not good enough
to take my place

646
01:06:14,937 --> 01:06:16,768
They don`t want you to leave

647
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:19,604
But you can`t run

648
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:22,977
...a relay all by yourself

649
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,045
lt can`t be done within a short period

650
01:06:26,882 --> 01:06:29,544
Find an appropriate time to
hand over your job

651
01:06:29,752 --> 01:06:31,413
lf you don`t

652
01:06:31,620 --> 01:06:33,417
...how do you know they are not ready?

653
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:36,989
Not for a while

654
01:06:39,095 --> 01:06:40,756
lt can never be done if you don`t try

655
01:06:43,632 --> 01:06:44,826
You are right

656
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:50,303
Go home and take a good rest

657
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:54,841
Tomorrow we will test new blood
Bill, please

658
01:06:55,478 --> 01:06:56,502
Thank you Sir

659
01:07:00,282 --> 01:07:02,477
Sir, how are the new blood?

660
01:07:03,753 --> 01:07:04,777
0kay

661
01:07:05,087 --> 01:07:08,022
You were like that when you first came

662
01:07:08,257 --> 01:07:10,555
Who`s going to give the lecture?

663
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:11,590
Lucky Lun

664
01:07:11,794 --> 01:07:12,988
Forget it. You know that l don`t like
to speak in public

665
01:07:13,195 --> 01:07:14,162
Head or tail?

666
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:16,764
Come on, don`t waste time

667
01:07:16,932 --> 01:07:17,421
Who`ll speak first?

668
01:07:17,600 --> 01:07:22,469
0K-attention!

669
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:24,103
Now to be a member

670
01:07:24,340 --> 01:07:25,466
...of the SDU is different
from being a DJ

671
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:27,775
Talking is secondary to action

672
01:07:28,944 --> 01:07:31,936
What l want to ask you is...

673
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:35,114
Why do you want to join the SDU?

674
01:07:35,618 --> 01:07:37,779
We want to be the best of the best

675
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:38,919
Louder

676
01:07:39,121 --> 01:07:41,646
We want to be the best of the best

677
01:07:41,857 --> 01:07:43,848
Now l`ll give you five minutes
to get changed

678
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:45,550
Then we`ll do the tests in the playground

679
01:07:45,761 --> 01:07:46,887
Yes, Sir

680
01:07:49,532 --> 01:07:51,261
He is good

681
01:07:51,801 --> 01:07:53,598
Yes, he is smart!

682
01:07:53,803 --> 01:07:54,861
l am always smart

683
01:07:55,271 --> 01:07:56,295
Go

684
01:07:57,073 --> 01:08:01,032
5 minutes! We need five minutes

685
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:02,437
...to go to the playground

686
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:03,612
Yes Sir

687
01:08:07,249 --> 01:08:07,977
Faster

688
01:08:12,354 --> 01:08:13,082
Faster

689
01:08:13,289 --> 01:08:14,483
They are getting worse and worse

690
01:08:16,559 --> 01:08:18,823
Keep in line!

691
01:08:20,296 --> 01:08:21,388
They are worse than me
when l first joined

692
01:08:23,332 --> 01:08:24,856
Wow, see these new guys

693
01:08:25,034 --> 01:08:26,626
They are much worse than us!

694
01:08:26,869 --> 01:08:29,736
Yes, they are getting worse and worse

695
01:08:30,639 --> 01:08:33,802
Though l have no sense of direction

696
01:08:34,043 --> 01:08:35,977
...l can still run faster than them

697
01:08:36,178 --> 01:08:38,339
Do you remember that back then

698
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:40,946
...when the instructor calls us

699
01:08:41,183 --> 01:08:42,309
...we all turn left while you turn right?

700
01:08:42,518 --> 01:08:43,610
Where are you going?

701
01:08:43,786 --> 01:08:45,447
l turned right to avoid blocking your way

702
01:08:45,654 --> 01:08:46,211
l was tying my shoe laces

703
01:08:46,455 --> 01:08:47,387
What a silly excuse!

704
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:48,182
And then when we changed our clothes

705
01:08:48,390 --> 01:08:49,357
...in the changing room

706
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:50,182
...he still had not come
even after we left

707
01:08:50,392 --> 01:08:50,858
That`s right

708
01:08:51,060 --> 01:08:52,493
l have to tidy the legs of my trousers

709
01:08:52,695 --> 01:08:53,719
Yes

710
01:08:54,330 --> 01:08:56,195
No. Ask his name

711
01:08:56,365 --> 01:08:57,730
Lucky Lun

712
01:08:58,634 --> 01:08:59,794
l thought you were gay

713
01:09:00,035 --> 01:09:00,501
Why?

714
01:09:00,736 --> 01:09:01,725
You were peeking at our bodies

715
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:03,734
Jesus was strong, so l
took a look at him

716
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:05,497
You are not that strong

717
01:09:05,741 --> 01:09:06,765
You asked me what the tests would be

718
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:07,533
l couldn`t answer you

719
01:09:07,776 --> 01:09:09,004
We came out of the dressing room and

720
01:09:09,211 --> 01:09:11,679
...jumped into the water immediately!

721
01:09:11,947 --> 01:09:12,413
lt was cold at that time

722
01:09:12,615 --> 01:09:13,081
Yeah, very cold

723
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:13,838
Yeah

724
01:09:14,049 --> 01:09:15,107
You haven`t tidied the legs
of your trousers

725
01:09:15,317 --> 01:09:15,681
Yeah

726
01:09:15,918 --> 01:09:16,646
John was funnier

727
01:09:16,852 --> 01:09:17,318
What?

728
01:09:17,586 --> 01:09:18,712
lnstead of shooting at the target

729
01:09:18,921 --> 01:09:20,411
...he shot sideways during training

730
01:09:20,623 --> 01:09:21,089
Yes

731
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:22,085
He is too casual

732
01:09:22,458 --> 01:09:22,947
l`m very serious

733
01:09:23,025 --> 01:09:23,650
l don`t think so. l think
you were just casual

734
01:09:23,859 --> 01:09:24,348
He`s making trouble everywhere

735
01:09:24,426 --> 01:09:25,859
...and was scolded by the instructors

736
01:09:26,395 --> 01:09:27,987
Why don`t you tell his stories?

737
01:09:29,098 --> 01:09:30,122
We were all scolded...

738
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:33,665
By Joe and Bill

739
01:09:33,836 --> 01:09:34,768
Bill! Bill!

740
01:09:34,904 --> 01:09:36,462
lt is you who said this

741
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:39,338
l don`t want to talk about Bill

742
01:09:39,508 --> 01:09:40,532
But you`ve said it

743
01:09:40,743 --> 01:09:41,471
Yeah

744
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:42,776
And now l can scold anyone

745
01:09:42,978 --> 01:09:43,740
...instead of being scolded

746
01:09:43,946 --> 01:09:44,605
lt`s a pity you weren`t here just now

747
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:45,647
0h yeah, how`s that?

748
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:48,782
Run faster

749
01:09:50,052 --> 01:09:50,711
Even if someone runs well...

750
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,282
l will still say he isn`t good enough

751
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:55,179
Are you thirsty?

752
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:56,755
Yeah, we are thirsty

753
01:09:56,992 --> 01:09:57,754
What should we drink?

754
01:09:57,960 --> 01:09:58,949
Your treat

755
01:09:59,161 --> 01:09:59,991
0kay

756
01:10:00,196 --> 01:10:02,027
So, let`s go

757
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:03,491
Go quickly

758
01:10:03,999 --> 01:10:05,626
Stone, are you really leaving?

759
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:07,893
Are you going to leave all
these naughty boys to us?

760
01:10:09,471 --> 01:10:10,768
This is my last chance

761
01:10:11,006 --> 01:10:12,769
You should know Ann

762
01:10:13,075 --> 01:10:14,872
lf l don`t get married this time

763
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:16,408
l will be single for the rest of my life

764
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:19,046
You shouldn`t abandon
the whole forest for one tree

765
01:10:19,348 --> 01:10:22,715
No, Sir! 0f course

766
01:10:22,918 --> 01:10:25,113
l know what are on their minds

767
01:10:25,287 --> 01:10:28,450
A few years ago, we were like them

768
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:32,651
But we were better physically

769
01:10:32,828 --> 01:10:35,797
l don`t believe some people
are born heroes

770
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:38,831
J ust spend six months training them

771
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:41,531
...and they will come out right!

772
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:46,401
We should give them a chance!

773
01:10:46,609 --> 01:10:48,372
Hey, you are right

774
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:51,645
You sound very mature

775
01:10:51,847 --> 01:10:55,476
l don`t believe that one can be lucky

776
01:10:55,684 --> 01:10:57,345
...or unlucky all his life

777
01:10:57,553 --> 01:10:58,383
Take me as an example

778
01:11:00,289 --> 01:11:02,052
l was paralyzed a few months ago, now

779
01:11:02,458 --> 01:11:03,720
...l can walk, and l am an instructor
in the SDU

780
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:07,818
All because you give me a chance

781
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:10,055
So l think we should give t
he new blood a chance

782
01:11:10,332 --> 01:11:12,357
Stone, look! What is this?

783
01:11:12,868 --> 01:11:13,664
Goose skin

784
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:18,670
But he sounds quite sensible
quite mature

785
01:11:19,508 --> 01:11:20,839
l won`t consider leaving the SDU

786
01:11:21,844 --> 01:11:24,244
...a few years ago

787
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:26,573
But now this guy is more mature

788
01:11:26,749 --> 01:11:29,149
l think l can go now

789
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:29,874
You are right

790
01:11:30,085 --> 01:11:30,881
Lucky Lun

791
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:34,683
Someone you desperately want
to meet has come

792
01:11:35,124 --> 01:11:36,853
l don`t want to see anyone now

793
01:11:37,026 --> 01:11:39,085
You must want to see this person

794
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,195
Who is it?

795
01:11:42,164 --> 01:11:43,756
l`ll go with you

796
01:11:44,199 --> 01:11:44,824
This person really wants to see me

797
01:11:45,034 --> 01:11:45,966
Sure

798
01:11:46,168 --> 01:11:47,328
Then go

799
01:11:47,936 --> 01:11:50,734
Yeah, go quickly

800
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:51,704
This coffee is really good

801
01:11:52,107 --> 01:11:52,903
Yes, where did you get it?

802
01:11:53,075 --> 01:11:53,939
J ust across the street

803
01:11:55,144 --> 01:11:56,543
This lame man

804
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:57,803
What are they doing?

805
01:11:58,547 --> 01:11:59,605
You need to get a wife

806
01:11:59,782 --> 01:12:01,750
They are young. They need to meet girls

807
01:12:03,852 --> 01:12:04,784
Ah Yee

808
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:06,181
Hey

809
01:12:06,388 --> 01:12:07,150
Wow!

810
01:12:07,356 --> 01:12:08,380
What happened to your leg?

811
01:12:08,757 --> 01:12:09,951
You two have a chat

812
01:12:11,860 --> 01:12:13,589
When did you return to Hong Kong?

813
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:15,287
l have returned for two days

814
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:18,591
How did you get hurt?

815
01:12:20,636 --> 01:12:23,161
ln an operation. l am okay now

816
01:12:23,372 --> 01:12:24,839
Almost completely recovered

817
01:12:25,507 --> 01:12:27,202
See, l can even run a bit now

818
01:12:29,278 --> 01:12:30,836
0kay, l believe you

819
01:12:31,046 --> 01:12:32,206
Let me hold your arms

820
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:39,418
l`ve heard about the tragedy
of your girl friend

821
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,283
Sorry, l shouldn`t ask

822
01:12:43,892 --> 01:12:46,759
Let bygones be bygones

823
01:12:46,962 --> 01:12:48,589
l had some happy times with her

824
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:49,731
...and some unhappy times

825
01:12:49,898 --> 01:12:51,229
lt is all over now

826
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,033
l still have to lead my life

827
01:12:54,036 --> 01:12:55,401
Sit down

828
01:12:55,871 --> 01:12:56,462
Here

829
01:12:56,672 --> 01:13:09,517
Grab it. This thing is getting in my way

830
01:13:14,890 --> 01:13:15,857
When will you leave?

831
01:13:17,526 --> 01:13:18,458
l won`t go back

832
01:13:18,627 --> 01:13:19,594
Why

833
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:23,326
Beijing is too big. l love Hong Kong

834
01:13:23,532 --> 01:13:25,397
lt is smaller and more convenient

835
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:27,127
Traffic is convenient

836
01:13:28,504 --> 01:13:29,732
Yeah, quite

837
01:13:30,038 --> 01:13:31,699
Did you make new friends?

838
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:34,205
Yeah, many

839
01:13:34,476 --> 01:13:36,239
Especially boys?

840
01:13:37,045 --> 01:13:44,952
No, l find their accents hard to learn

841
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:48,180
When they say anything

842
01:13:48,357 --> 01:13:54,057
...they always add an ``r`` to the end
of the word

843
01:13:54,396 --> 01:13:55,920
Like lunchrr instead of lunch

844
01:13:56,165 --> 01:13:59,032
So l like Hong Kong boys more!

845
01:13:59,334 --> 01:14:00,631
But don`t you love their tongues

846
01:14:00,836 --> 01:14:03,464
...which can roll all the ``r``s?

847
01:14:08,010 --> 01:14:11,070
You haven`t changed

848
01:14:12,014 --> 01:14:14,005
No, l am just joking

849
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:16,046
Can`t you be more serious?

850
01:14:16,985 --> 01:14:18,316
l do hope that you have changed

851
01:14:18,487 --> 01:14:19,511
...but you are still the same

852
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:21,882
He`s more serious now

853
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:23,587
How do you know?

854
01:14:23,792 --> 01:14:25,987
0f course l know. l am always with him

855
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:34,260
Ah Yee, can we...

856
01:14:34,436 --> 01:14:35,425
Sure

857
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:36,604
Do you know what l am
going to ask her?

858
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:46,009
You want to ask her if you two
could be friends, right?

859
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:50,508
0h yes, maybe even go steady

860
01:14:54,990 --> 01:14:56,014
Can we?

861
01:14:59,795 --> 01:15:01,126
l`ll take you back

862
01:15:02,531 --> 01:15:10,302
Good, can l kiss a friend?

863
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:13,100
Let me hold you

864
01:15:41,036 --> 01:15:42,936
lf Hon Gin hadn`t taken the wrong step

865
01:15:43,138 --> 01:15:44,833
l am sure he would be a good cop

866
01:15:46,241 --> 01:15:49,472
Hon had made many mistakes

867
01:15:49,678 --> 01:15:52,078
...but he was a good man

868
01:15:52,281 --> 01:15:55,546
Even if he was not a cop

869
01:15:56,518 --> 01:16:01,979
You are right. But l feel sorry for Piano

870
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:04,456
When people fall in love

871
01:16:04,893 --> 01:16:09,057
...they accept everything
about his partner

872
01:16:09,464 --> 01:16:13,901
Piano truly loved Hon!

873
01:16:16,371 --> 01:16:17,895
lt`s perhaps romantic

874
01:16:18,106 --> 01:16:19,937
...to die for the one you love

875
01:16:20,142 --> 01:16:21,404
...though it`s not rational

876
01:16:21,610 --> 01:16:22,804
Do you agree?

877
01:16:24,813 --> 01:16:25,780
Maybe

878
01:16:26,748 --> 01:16:29,945
l always tell Kim what happens to you

879
01:16:30,152 --> 01:16:31,084
Do you?

880
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:33,517
We are good friends

881
01:16:33,889 --> 01:16:36,016
Since we will soon go to the States

882
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:37,486
...let`s go and visit her grave

883
01:16:37,659 --> 01:16:38,921
No problem

884
01:16:39,628 --> 01:16:42,119
ln fact, l have arranged everything

885
01:16:42,331 --> 01:16:43,320
Let`s go get the flowers

886
01:16:44,266 --> 01:16:46,063
You have arranged everything?

887
01:16:46,234 --> 01:16:48,361
0f course, so there will be no excuse

888
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:53,036
Cousin, don`t you feel a bit strange?

889
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:54,139
What`s the matter?

890
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:55,705
You are getting married tomorrow

891
01:16:55,911 --> 01:16:57,105
...and leave for the States

892
01:16:57,312 --> 01:16:57,971
...but you are packing your luggage

893
01:16:58,213 --> 01:16:59,407
...alone at home all by yourself!

894
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:01,446
We are like that

895
01:17:01,650 --> 01:17:03,208
Each minds his own business

896
01:17:04,052 --> 01:17:06,782
But, don`t you think this isn`t right?

897
01:17:06,989 --> 01:17:09,287
What the hell is he doing in the camp?

898
01:17:10,158 --> 01:17:12,524
Probably nothing

899
01:17:14,296 --> 01:17:15,160
Really?

900
01:17:20,068 --> 01:17:21,035
Hey

901
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:22,099
Are you packing?

902
01:17:22,504 --> 01:17:23,937
Yeah, and you?

903
01:17:24,106 --> 01:17:25,573
l don`t have much to pack

904
01:17:26,108 --> 01:17:28,872
Tomorrow, you come to the camp
to pick me up

905
01:17:29,778 --> 01:17:30,710
0kay

906
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:32,412
l won`t bother you now. Bye

907
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:33,275
Bye

908
01:17:34,716 --> 01:17:35,614
Who is it? ls that him?

909
01:17:35,817 --> 01:17:36,681
Yes

910
01:17:38,453 --> 01:17:40,512
What did he say?

911
01:17:40,722 --> 01:17:42,280
He asked me to pick him up tomorrow

912
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:44,319
l know what is wrong!

913
01:17:44,526 --> 01:17:45,185
You have reversed your roles

914
01:17:45,394 --> 01:17:47,555
You act like a man and he
acts like a woman

915
01:17:47,763 --> 01:17:49,355
You have to pick him up tomorrow

916
01:17:52,567 --> 01:17:53,966
lt pisses me off

917
01:18:08,016 --> 01:18:09,950
Attention

918
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:11,049
Directionless Mo

919
01:18:12,287 --> 01:18:13,151
Sir

920
01:18:14,423 --> 01:18:22,194
Thank you. You are the best of the best

921
01:18:22,998 --> 01:18:25,023
l enjoy working with you

922
01:18:25,834 --> 01:18:28,496
Thanks for your courage and efforts

923
01:18:28,704 --> 01:18:31,537
Keep up the good traditions of the SDU

924
01:18:32,340 --> 01:18:33,830
Wish you all good luck

925
01:18:38,013 --> 01:18:48,947
Take care. You too, Joe. Take care

926
01:18:50,025 --> 01:18:51,856
0kay, take your time

927
01:19:14,349 --> 01:19:15,782
You must remember this place

928
01:19:17,085 --> 01:19:20,054
Yes, there are many
good memories here

929
01:19:21,456 --> 01:19:26,120
Bill, Hon Gin, Jesu, Lucky Lun
Directionless Mo

930
01:19:27,462 --> 01:19:33,264
l was here everyday, teaching them

931
01:19:33,468 --> 01:19:35,163
l also thought about you while l was here

932
01:19:35,403 --> 01:19:37,234
...so you are also in my memory

933
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:42,338
l think you should stay

934
01:19:42,677 --> 01:19:45,475
What are you saying?

935
01:19:46,081 --> 01:19:48,140
We have arranged everything

936
01:19:48,917 --> 01:19:50,350
0ur entire luggage is here

937
01:19:52,554 --> 01:19:53,612
Don`t you know that you will be unhappy

938
01:19:53,889 --> 01:19:56,255
...if you come with me to the States?

939
01:19:58,693 --> 01:19:59,921
l am a foreigner in Hong Kong

940
01:20:00,228 --> 01:20:01,855
l will feel more at ease in the States...

941
01:20:02,063 --> 01:20:03,792
Even more at ease with you by my side

942
01:20:04,599 --> 01:20:07,295
l don`t think so. You are not a foreigner

943
01:20:07,536 --> 01:20:10,369
You are more conservative than me

944
01:20:10,572 --> 01:20:11,539
Really?

945
01:20:12,974 --> 01:20:14,771
ln fact, it means a lot

946
01:20:15,076 --> 01:20:16,805
...when you gave me this ring

947
01:20:17,746 --> 01:20:18,713
Thank you

948
01:20:27,823 --> 01:20:29,484
l want to go with you

949
01:20:29,658 --> 01:20:32,855
You will be bored if you go alone

950
01:20:33,061 --> 01:20:35,689
No, l won`t. l have to study

951
01:20:35,897 --> 01:20:37,592
l will think of you when l have time

952
01:20:37,799 --> 01:20:38,288
Really?

953
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:45,929
You stay! l am leaving now

954
01:24:42,377 --> 01:24:43,173
Sir

955
01:24:43,711 --> 01:24:44,541
Lucky Lun, how are you?

956
01:24:45,213 --> 01:24:46,237
Getting fatter and fatter

957
01:24:47,115 --> 01:24:47,979
How`s your leg?

958
01:24:48,183 --> 01:24:49,673
l can run like them

959
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:52,053
Are they running?

960
01:24:52,253 --> 01:24:54,153
l don`t think so. They are just walking!

961
01:24:54,389 --> 01:24:55,549
l agree

962
01:24:56,157 --> 01:24:57,089
What the hell are you doing?

963
01:24:57,325 --> 01:24:58,792
Walking or running?

964
01:25:04,766 --> 01:25:05,494
Welcome back

965
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:11,861
l have thought it over for a long time

966
01:25:12,073 --> 01:25:13,665
l don`t think l can leave now because

967
01:25:14,008 --> 01:25:16,374
...you are still not mature enough

968
01:25:17,445 --> 01:25:18,309
What happened?

969
01:25:19,414 --> 01:25:20,779
What about this training?

970
01:25:21,182 --> 01:25:22,114
Still want to run?

971
01:25:22,383 --> 01:25:23,145
Yes, Sir

972
01:25:23,351 --> 01:25:24,181
Do you want some training?

973
01:25:24,419 --> 01:25:25,317
Yes, Sir

974
01:25:25,487 --> 01:25:28,650
