1
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,428
This is for Jin ju!

2
00:00:31,564 --> 00:00:33,361
Hey, you fool

3
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:39,001
- What, me?
- Yeah you.

4
00:00:41,374 --> 00:00:42,671
What now?!

5
00:00:43,743 --> 00:00:46,007
You should write down
where it is going.

6
00:00:48,615 --> 00:00:50,640
I just told you.

7
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:57,579
You are hired
to do these things.

8
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,532
Don't just sit there
and do nothing.

9
00:01:12,172 --> 00:01:16,438
Soon you will get fired.
I am sure of that

10
00:01:18,845 --> 00:01:19,709
Go to hell!

11
00:01:35,395 --> 00:01:38,228
It's only a cigarette.

12
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:43,959
You piece of shit.

13
00:01:52,912 --> 00:02:02,878
Cherry Tomato

14
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,653
Sin Gu

15
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,659
Kim Hyang Gi

16
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:16,291
Kim Young Ho
(Special appearance)

17
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:28,508
Director Jung Young Bae

18
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,349
When did you move away?

19
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,583
Your last house was empty.

20
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:44,264
You seemed to have lived
pretty well there.

21
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:47,358
We moved right after
you went to prison.

22
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,891
She's listening.

23
00:02:56,109 --> 00:02:58,907
Water them everyday.
Keep it under sunshine.

24
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:00,810
Are you giving me this?

25
00:03:02,615 --> 00:03:04,217
Does she go
to school these days?

26
00:03:04,217 --> 00:03:05,878
I'm only 6.

27
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,582
Then you must go to kindergarten.

28
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:12,825
Don't you see she can't?

29
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:15,385
Poor people like us can't
put her to kindergarten.

30
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:20,333
Then why does she
have the backpack?

31
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,960
To look like one!

32
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:29,507
Do you want tofu?

33
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:34,069
Do you get something out
of demolition thing?

34
00:03:35,515 --> 00:03:38,951
I get so tired earning
day's worth money.

35
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:41,578
Chun sam...

36
00:03:42,355 --> 00:03:45,586
Your dad's age is 70
as of this year.

37
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,819
I am too tired to live my life.

38
00:03:49,862 --> 00:03:52,831
Now you take care of your
daughter on your own.

39
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:57,770
I curious, do you still
get your pension money?

40
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,930
What money?

41
00:04:00,707 --> 00:04:03,733
How can you think of
stealing my pension money?

42
00:04:05,211 --> 00:04:08,271
I was just curious if you
could make living with it?

43
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:12,580
Take all the money you can
from the government.

44
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:16,289
I would even leave my daughter
if they gave me money.

45
00:04:16,289 --> 00:04:17,688
You son of a bitch.

46
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:21,494
Why make your only daughter
become an orphan?

47
00:04:21,494 --> 00:04:23,496
Crazy bastard.

48
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:25,298
Stop you old man.

49
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:28,825
I couldn't even get injection
when I was a child.

50
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:32,438
You had money for tavern

51
00:04:32,438 --> 00:04:34,429
but you didn't have
money for my injection.

52
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:38,607
I wouldn't be crippled
if I had one.

53
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:50,382
She always tumbles
down like that

54
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,097
What about the money
selling house?

55
00:04:58,097 --> 00:05:00,088
Get her a pair of glasses?

56
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:05,167
I saved it to go to Hong Kong
You have problem with that?

57
00:05:10,710 --> 00:05:13,474
I would have known.
Stingy old man.

58
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:21,454
I am so tired.

59
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:23,945
I searched the whole
town looking for you.

60
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,357
Go to sleep.

61
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,558
And find a job
in your dreams.

62
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:32,226
Soon I will throw
you out of here.

63
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:36,365
Hey daughter.

64
00:05:39,172 --> 00:05:40,935
Lie with me for old times sake.

65
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,035
No thank you.

66
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,962
Stop that

67
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,974
I have already found them
under the mat, drawer

68
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:23,202
and blankets.

69
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:29,338
I have conscience too.
I won't steal them again.

70
00:07:32,485 --> 00:07:35,613
You can guard your money
after three days

71
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:37,619
when I steal them

72
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:45,052
I can't get any
sleep because of you.

73
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:52,104
You might as well
lend them to me

74
00:07:52,104 --> 00:07:53,469
if you don't want
me stealing it.

75
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:58,877
I should tie your lips
of tie your feet.

76
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:01,670
Why would you handcuff
my foot?

77
00:08:17,597 --> 00:08:18,894
Father.

78
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:31,842
I am coming back even if I had
to go way round the other way.

79
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:41,211
I am coming back, okay?

80
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:54,160
Pops, Dad's gone.

81
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:59,128
We held hands so tight
but he's gone.

82
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,831
Hey, pops.

83
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:50,481
You go inside.
And don't wait up.

84
00:10:02,835 --> 00:10:08,341
Pops, are you going to work?
Are you huh?

85
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:11,674
You have go to work, okay?

86
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,374
Are you kidding me?
You think this is a joke?

87
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:22,348
My house was robbed.
He took everything, it's true.

88
00:10:22,788 --> 00:10:27,157
I went to the bank this morning
and I have nothing left.

89
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,562
Even your face look yellowish.

90
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:33,532
And his face looks also yellow
I can't get hold of myself.

91
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,234
I won't do it again.

92
00:10:35,234 --> 00:10:41,507
That's enough. Say sorry?
How many times have you said that?

93
00:10:41,507 --> 00:10:45,277
You have bad reputation
around here.

94
00:10:45,277 --> 00:10:48,614
You can stop coming here
from now on.

95
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:53,319
Bong soo, forgive me.
I want to live.

96
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:56,188
I am too old to work

97
00:10:56,188 --> 00:11:01,285
but I have no one to take
care of me but myself.

98
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,693
Hey, you three.

99
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,937
I messed up my kid
but you are worse.

100
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,273
You thoughtless piece of shit.

101
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:20,178
From now on I won't
even look this way.

102
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,085
What did I tell you?

103
00:11:26,085 --> 00:11:29,822
Do yourself a favor
and make eyes for dolls.

104
00:11:29,822 --> 00:11:31,119
You are pouring gas on a fire.

105
00:11:31,724 --> 00:11:35,995
He was waiting for you
to make trouble.

106
00:11:35,995 --> 00:11:42,730
You worked for a year
and I think it's long enough.

107
00:11:43,269 --> 00:11:45,638
Find a job for me.
I will come back here again.

108
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,936
My cigarette.

109
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:54,647
Think again,
you are not young.

110
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:58,117
You will die working so hard.

111
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,550
Where is he going?

112
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:22,875
Why wouldn't she eat?
I only did it for her.

113
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:25,844
Why left overs?

114
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,254
Helpless child.

115
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,185
What?

116
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:22,487
- Hey.
- What is it?

117
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:30,425
- Please let's not do this.
- What do you mean?

118
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:35,735
Don't you know work ethics?

119
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:41,046
It's my district from this alley
to that village office over there.

120
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:43,514
Who asked you?
I am tired so stop it

121
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:48,020
I am busy
so make space here.

122
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:50,623
You don't know it yet

123
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:54,193
but we have zone
divided up for this job.

124
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:54,716
Here.

125
00:15:00,099 --> 00:15:01,031
Fine?

126
00:15:06,338 --> 00:15:07,669
Dame it.

127
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:57,423
You think this cart is
some sports car?

128
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,789
Stop blocking the road.

129
00:16:07,366 --> 00:16:09,095
I can honk too.

130
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:28,852
It's 15 kilograms.
750won.

131
00:16:30,422 --> 00:16:36,395
2, 4, 6, 8, 38.

132
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,692
780 won.

133
00:16:39,698 --> 00:16:43,302
You are illiterate still
you count so well.

134
00:16:43,302 --> 00:16:47,606
Why did you bring in so little?

135
00:16:47,606 --> 00:16:50,131
It's annoying
to give you change.

136
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:52,411
Your scale is broken.

137
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,546
You forgot about all the numbers
behind this number here.

138
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,411
I am taking that much.

139
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,246
So see you tomorrow.

140
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,180
You took
one thousand won more.

141
00:17:26,512 --> 00:17:32,212
What are you doing?
Stop it, you'll get hurt

142
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:02,775
- Pops.
- Why are you out here?

143
00:18:05,517 --> 00:18:08,854
Give me that
Thank you.

144
00:18:08,854 --> 00:18:10,754
No, no. Get out of here.

145
00:18:12,758 --> 00:18:13,918
Da Sung.

146
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:17,423
Where are you going?

147
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:26,238
Hey pops,
what are you doing?

148
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,907
Secure our living.
Secure the living.

149
00:18:28,907 --> 00:18:30,676
Secure our living.

150
00:18:30,676 --> 00:18:31,743
Secure the living.

151
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:35,008
How can you collect
bottles at this time?

152
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,216
Just one more okay?

153
00:18:37,216 --> 00:18:39,585
I was not going to say this.

154
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:43,722
but I heard you signed on
the demolition agreement form?

155
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:46,247
They would have some idea
as to where we should go.

156
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:50,262
If they did, we wouldn't
be here going so crazy.

157
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:52,731
We are going to have
to live on the streets.

158
00:18:52,731 --> 00:18:56,223
They can't run the house
down if we are living in them.

159
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,177
Jong Douk, come here.
You'll get hurt

160
00:19:05,177 --> 00:19:06,838
Attack.

161
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:32,971
Shit, those bastards
broke my cart.

162
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:35,769
Kill the bastards.
What would I do without my cart.

163
00:19:37,609 --> 00:19:43,445
You fucking morons.
Stop!

164
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:23,778
Why are you so late?
We are all out of meat

165
00:20:24,323 --> 00:20:27,259
My cart broke down.

166
00:20:27,259 --> 00:20:29,962
But did you say meat?

167
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:33,565
This is our last day so we
prepared enough meat

168
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,328
Last? What last?

169
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:40,005
There it says suspension
of free lunch.

170
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:42,074
We can't work here anymore
because this is demolition area

171
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,976
Then where should we go?

172
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:47,045
It's far away. It takes
40 minutes from here.

173
00:20:47,045 --> 00:20:50,282
I can walk 40 minutes
if I can eat

174
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:52,584
No, you have to take
the subway for 40 minutes

175
00:20:52,584 --> 00:20:54,620
Subway? Damn it.

176
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,383
Eat two meals and you
won't have for nothing.

177
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:59,657
Hurry and find
the shelter old man.

178
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:01,893
I don't have to stay together.

179
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:05,761
You don't have to stay together.
Send her to orphanage.

180
00:21:06,698 --> 00:21:10,168
Sister, do you know any shelter?
Have you ever worked there?

181
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:11,770
Send her to somewhere else

182
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:14,170
till you find good place
to stay with her?

183
00:21:15,707 --> 00:21:18,710
I think she knows
what you are saying.

184
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:20,879
Jong Douk!
Hey, sit down.

185
00:21:20,879 --> 00:21:22,574
Stop that

186
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,314
Jong Douk, Jong Douk.

187
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:32,413
Pops, you and I need to talk.

188
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,695
I'm gonna go to the president's
house and deal with this.

189
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:38,185
Come with us.

190
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:45,500
You coarsened an illiterate old man
to get his signature, you jerks.

191
00:21:46,004 --> 00:21:49,167
Son, where are you?

192
00:21:51,376 --> 00:21:58,116
Stop the demolition.
We will fight.

193
00:21:58,116 --> 00:21:59,351
Yeah.

194
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:05,813
We received calls
and we got orders.

195
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:12,664
- Stop the demolition.
- No demolition!

196
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:18,193
- We will fight for our lives.
- We will fight, fight.

197
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,438
Everyone lie down.

198
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:30,582
Why didn't you give us
something to lie on? Why?

199
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:32,174
He said lie down.

200
00:22:32,651 --> 00:22:34,209
- Arrest them.
- Yeah.

201
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,119
I won't go.

202
00:22:40,992 --> 00:22:43,893
I am not going.

203
00:22:53,672 --> 00:22:58,473
Take him instead.
Why aren't you arresting them?

204
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:12,286
Don't go grand father.
Don't take him.

205
00:23:17,295 --> 00:23:19,498
The policeman was very kind.

206
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:22,331
You think he's good?

207
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:24,401
Then give him an award
why don't you?

208
00:23:24,836 --> 00:23:28,373
But Pops,
did you see the tree?

209
00:23:28,373 --> 00:23:30,864
Don't talk about your Dad.

210
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:35,680
I saw apples on the tree
What was it?

211
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,442
Shut up.

212
00:23:36,982 --> 00:23:38,210
Walk fast
and don't tumble down

213
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:12,211
Please use
the measuring spoon.

214
00:24:13,251 --> 00:24:14,786
My husband won't like it

215
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,651
if he sees you doing
clumsily with your hands.

216
00:24:18,990 --> 00:24:21,754
And please put vitamin
and nutrient.

217
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,780
Two months has passed

218
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:53,882
and still Tanya
is not comfortable.

219
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:57,721
It's not easy for us
and it is same for Tanya.

220
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:00,792
Leave her alone.
She'll get used to it.

221
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:17,614
I met Dr. Chang.

222
00:25:18,116 --> 00:25:20,914
Wife, only care about Tanya.

223
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:26,214
And don't think
about having a child.

224
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,551
I only want you
to care about Tanya.

225
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:37,602
How did you do with
the insecticide?

226
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:39,297
I did well.

227
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,005
We need strong insecticide.

228
00:25:42,941 --> 00:25:45,466
Mites get fat in winter.

229
00:25:47,312 --> 00:25:50,304
We should do them now
before the spring comes.

230
00:25:55,186 --> 00:25:57,245
But be careful around Tanya.

231
00:25:58,857 --> 00:26:00,381
Prepare to give bath to Tanya.

232
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:02,189
Yes, sir.

233
00:26:11,536 --> 00:26:13,527
What now?

234
00:26:20,312 --> 00:26:23,213
- What happened to your glasses?
- I broke them a while back.

235
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:24,708
Get up.

236
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:43,435
- 500 won, really?
- Yes, want some hot pancakes?

237
00:26:43,435 --> 00:26:44,925
Sure. Give me one?

238
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:48,101
Here we go.

239
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:55,477
- Thank you.
- It's big.

240
00:26:57,916 --> 00:26:59,084
Have some first.

241
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:03,384
You go ahead and
don't spill the honey.

242
00:27:04,522 --> 00:27:06,456
What did I tell you.
Don't spill it.

243
00:27:07,993 --> 00:27:08,925
What is this?

244
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:14,329
What?
That blood sucking fraud.

245
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:17,135
Liar.

246
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:19,137
What did you say?

247
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:21,833
It says here that it's
a liar pan cakes.

248
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:28,673
It's all empty inside.
Please learn to read.

249
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,214
I am sending you to orphanage
if you keep on misbehaving.

250
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:52,970
Foolish girl.
Stop crying.

251
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,909
I can't take it anymore.

252
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:59,638
Why are you
doing this to me.

253
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,108
This way, can't you see?

254
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:09,342
What are you doing?

255
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:19,431
Hold still.
Don't make me spank you.

256
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:22,229
- Da Sung.
- Hey, Jong Duck.

257
00:28:24,135 --> 00:28:25,693
Where were you?

258
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:32,143
I got a call from
your son a minute ago.

259
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:34,839
I don't know how
he knew my number.

260
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:42,317
He said he did something bad.
He said it's so damn bad thing.

261
00:28:43,955 --> 00:28:47,926
Anyway he's going to come back
after he's done with his business.

262
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:50,361
Did he leave his number?

263
00:28:50,361 --> 00:28:54,821
No, he just told me to give you
his message and hung up.

264
00:28:55,667 --> 00:29:01,740
I don't know if we would still have
electricity and telephone till then.

265
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,310
It's a long day today.

266
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:10,043
- Da Sung, I am coming soon.
- What are you talking about?

267
00:29:16,221 --> 00:29:17,813
Da Sung.

268
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:31,059
Come quick.

269
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:33,571
Hurry.

270
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,040
I am starving.

271
00:29:39,711 --> 00:29:43,181
- Look there?
- Where?

272
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:46,446
- There?
- What is that?

273
00:29:49,187 --> 00:29:50,279
Dried fish.

274
00:29:58,329 --> 00:29:59,694
I can do this.

275
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:06,629
Let's sell them and earn big.

276
00:30:07,572 --> 00:30:09,563
I was not always lucky.

277
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:13,444
I was a bad luck since when
I was in my mother's womb.

278
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:21,274
But this time
the luck is on my side.

279
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:26,752
Yeah, it's about time.

280
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:36,262
This way or that way.
Wherever, who cares?

281
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:45,372
This is a gold mine.

282
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:07,058
We need to get some more.

283
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:12,463
Let's drive with these
sitting on our laps.

284
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,171
You said there's no one here.

285
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:20,508
Oh, shit...

286
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,049
Start the gear.

287
00:31:35,927 --> 00:31:37,128
Be careful.

288
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:42,500
It's only used car.
Let's go.

289
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,937
This is my daughter
and my father's life truck.

290
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:48,565
You do it again
and I kill you.

291
00:31:48,973 --> 00:31:52,909
Okay, okay.
Let's go now.

292
00:32:02,987 --> 00:32:06,889
What is this smell?
Is this your smell? Or the fish?

293
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:09,158
Whatever.

294
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,353
You look like you
are going to burst.

295
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:39,255
I will order the meal for you.

296
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:49,958
This is my first success.

297
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:56,369
Why was I so foolish?

298
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:03,943
But anyway I did it okay.

299
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:22,990
Wait for me Da Sung.

300
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:35,075
Da Sung, I am gonna
send you to kindergarten.

301
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,590
We will meet soon.

302
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:07,103
Pops.

303
00:35:12,844 --> 00:35:17,582
- Pops, my tree and our house.
- Say it again?

304
00:35:17,582 --> 00:35:20,745
Come quick, our house.

305
00:35:22,553 --> 00:35:25,579
Hey you, what are you
doing nailing the house?

306
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,217
Stop that!
How dare you.

307
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:35,259
- What do you mean?
- Stop.

308
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:43,204
Don't hit my pops.

309
00:35:52,817 --> 00:35:56,685
- You poor bastards.
- Go over there.

310
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:00,088
Hurry.

311
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,749
Don't do it!
My house...

312
00:36:37,328 --> 00:36:44,860
Dad, I miss you.

313
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:20,831
It's a waste of time.
Come and eat some meat

314
00:37:22,773 --> 00:37:27,733
- Did he hurt badly?
- His arm broke.

315
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:40,790
Crazy girl.

316
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:53,838
Are you a bagger?

317
00:37:53,838 --> 00:37:56,534
Why are you picking up
things like that?

318
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:18,729
It's not like you starved
for couple of days?

319
00:38:18,729 --> 00:38:19,718
Only a day.

320
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:23,567
You only missed three meals.
Stop whining.

321
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:24,869
I am hungry.

322
00:38:24,869 --> 00:38:29,670
I will buy you lunch.
So don't talk about that tree.

323
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:33,377
- But that's what Dad gave us.
- Shut up.

324
00:38:33,377 --> 00:38:35,345
Don't talk about him.

325
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,824
- I want that
- What are you talking about?

326
00:38:53,164 --> 00:38:55,530
We want that one.
It's 2000 won.

327
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:57,461
Give us plenty.

328
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,443
What about you?

329
00:39:08,112 --> 00:39:09,579
I won't eat yours.

330
00:39:30,267 --> 00:39:32,326
- It's too hot.
- Drink some water.

331
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:38,368
- It's burning.
- Drink more water.

332
00:39:40,644 --> 00:39:41,872
I said drink water.

333
00:39:42,847 --> 00:39:45,042
Let's go.

334
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:47,443
See you later.

335
00:39:47,852 --> 00:39:50,787
Hey, old man.
Keep your feet to yourself.

336
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:55,419
It was delicious thank you.

337
00:39:56,093 --> 00:39:59,187
See you all tomorrow.

338
00:40:09,206 --> 00:40:12,937
- There's meat, eat
- No, it's dirty.

339
00:40:15,846 --> 00:40:20,010
You won't get any food.
Is that what you want?

340
00:40:29,026 --> 00:40:30,755
Shit.

341
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:36,791
Stay here.

342
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:40,662
Let me go with you.

343
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:43,507
I will be right there.
Now eat

344
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:46,305
- I am going with you.
- I won't run away.

345
00:41:03,994 --> 00:41:06,155
I will kill those morons.

346
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:24,982
What will you do?

347
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:28,543
I am going to end it
once and for all.

1
00:42:15,532 --> 00:42:18,262
Wow, it's bigger
than our kindergarten.

2
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:20,736
You have never been
to kindergarten.

3
00:42:59,676 --> 00:43:00,870
Let's go inside.

4
00:43:02,312 --> 00:43:03,711
Let's go.

5
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,283
I don't care
if you freeze to death.

6
00:43:07,283 --> 00:43:09,719
Don't try to blame me.

7
00:43:09,719 --> 00:43:11,619
Do whatever you wish.

8
00:43:12,522 --> 00:43:14,157
We are not thieves.

9
00:43:14,157 --> 00:43:17,593
You are just like your mother.
Stubborn child

10
00:43:37,413 --> 00:43:44,285
Now that we are here.
I gotta get money for my cart.

11
00:44:18,788 --> 00:44:19,846
3000 won?

12
00:44:24,961 --> 00:44:26,952
8000 won?
They must be mad.

13
00:44:27,263 --> 00:44:30,699
They spend my daily
payment on one yogurt

14
00:44:36,506 --> 00:44:39,066
Hey look here.
I am eating an ice cream

15
00:44:42,078 --> 00:44:45,241
And I am eating them
all by myself. So good.

16
00:45:10,306 --> 00:45:11,898
And you pretended
like you were a lady.

17
00:45:24,254 --> 00:45:26,484
Pops, here take it.

18
00:45:31,227 --> 00:45:34,196
Leave it there.
We don't take money.

19
00:46:04,427 --> 00:46:10,855
Press it. Do it later.
You fart just like your mother.

20
00:46:18,508 --> 00:46:19,998
You smell so bad.

21
00:46:29,085 --> 00:46:32,077
Yes, just a moment. sir.

22
00:47:05,521 --> 00:47:08,217
Hello.
Meat delivery.

23
00:47:09,625 --> 00:47:10,489
Good bye.

24
00:47:37,620 --> 00:47:39,722
I can't take it anymore.
Where do I pea?

25
00:47:39,722 --> 00:47:41,090
don't fart.

26
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:42,785
How come?

27
00:48:14,123 --> 00:48:15,750
How come?

28
00:48:16,793 --> 00:48:20,854
Squeeze you ass as hard
as you could and don't fart.

29
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:07,543
Yes, boss.
I left the house to walk Tanya.

30
00:49:08,478 --> 00:49:12,148
Are you there now?

31
00:49:12,148 --> 00:49:14,750
How is Tanya doing?
And the meat?

32
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:20,985
- Yes, I am giving them to her.
- Take care of it.

33
00:49:21,591 --> 00:49:25,254
- What about the quality?
- They are good.

34
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:57,390
He's gone.
Come on.

35
00:50:01,964 --> 00:50:06,736
You can breath now.

36
00:50:06,736 --> 00:50:11,174
- How should you know?
- My ears are not for decoration.

37
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:16,212
Didn't you hear what he said
just now? They are gone.

38
00:50:16,212 --> 00:50:20,883
We will leave before that noisy
bastard comes back.

39
00:50:20,883 --> 00:50:22,441
But the door's locked.

40
00:50:48,344 --> 00:50:49,436
Damn it.

41
00:50:59,188 --> 00:51:01,986
The dog and his owner
must be crazy.

42
00:51:11,968 --> 00:51:15,131
- Park, are you going?
- Yeah.

43
00:51:18,741 --> 00:51:22,837
- See you.
- I am envious of you.

44
00:51:23,346 --> 00:51:25,678
Take care,
don't work to hard.

45
00:51:26,148 --> 00:51:27,672
You should take it easy
And don't work too hard.

46
00:51:58,581 --> 00:52:01,209
How do I get it open?

47
00:52:06,322 --> 00:52:07,516
Darn.

48
00:52:14,797 --> 00:52:17,357
You didn't get
it open before.

49
00:52:18,934 --> 00:52:22,563
I was startled.

50
00:52:25,574 --> 00:52:28,543
You are doing it all wrong.

51
00:52:36,485 --> 00:52:38,248
How did you do it?

52
00:52:39,422 --> 00:52:41,151
What did you press?

53
00:52:58,774 --> 00:53:01,607
The dog doesn't bark.
Why are you so frightened?

54
00:53:02,244 --> 00:53:03,404
Haven't you never
seen a dog before?

55
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:06,244
Tell me, what did you press?

56
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:00,932
Can we take this too?

57
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:06,436
Pops, I want to take these.

58
00:54:07,143 --> 00:54:12,410
I have ruined an angel like you.
I have to send you away.

59
00:54:21,891 --> 00:54:23,756
What are you doing?
Aren't we going yet?

60
00:54:24,360 --> 00:54:27,830
Little thing, don't you want
to go to kindergarten?

61
00:54:27,830 --> 00:54:31,630
- Kindergarten?
- Yeah, don't you want to go?

62
00:54:31,934 --> 00:54:35,267
Of course. My friends
must be in upper class by now.

63
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,705
We don't have place to go
when we get out of here.

64
00:54:40,409 --> 00:54:43,037
Let's stay here.

65
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:50,943
Don't be so scared, If we get
caught we just leave here.

66
00:54:51,554 --> 00:54:54,148
Doesn't matter
if they throw us out.

67
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,322
Just stay here for a while.

68
00:54:56,959 --> 00:54:58,394
So we are not leaving yet?

69
00:54:58,394 --> 00:55:00,294
Then I will bring in the bag.

70
00:55:33,696 --> 00:55:36,499
Hello, it's me.

71
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,057
I am going out.

72
00:55:39,668 --> 00:55:42,398
Do you think I am their slave?

73
00:55:44,073 --> 00:55:48,169
Yeah right.
See you there.

74
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:10,566
Deep your head in.
You are not touching the water.

75
00:56:10,566 --> 00:56:12,090
I am doing it.

76
00:56:16,138 --> 00:56:18,107
Here's water.

77
00:56:18,107 --> 00:56:20,409
Come here.
It's warm.

78
00:56:20,409 --> 00:56:22,070
Hey, come here.

79
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:24,211
Where?

80
00:56:27,683 --> 00:56:32,382
It's bubbly.
How much does this cost?

81
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:36,389
I can't read.
It's all so scrambled.

82
00:56:39,461 --> 00:56:41,156
It's like a boat
Isn't it?

83
00:56:46,302 --> 00:56:51,330
Take off your glasses.
Why are you wearing them?

84
00:56:52,875 --> 00:56:56,311
- I can't see.
- Don't talk back.

85
00:57:01,216 --> 00:57:02,274
Wow, Pops.

86
00:57:03,852 --> 00:57:05,513
Wow, Pops.
It's so nice. I like it.

87
00:57:13,996 --> 00:57:16,123
You are all wet.
My child.

88
00:57:17,032 --> 00:57:19,227
So wonderful. Isn't it the
first time for you too?

89
00:57:24,173 --> 00:57:26,767
- Ya.
- Stop that, you little brat

90
00:57:54,003 --> 00:57:57,962
I will come back soon.
You have to stay here.

91
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:00,175
Please let me go before the
subway stops working.

92
00:58:00,175 --> 00:58:03,838
Take me with you.
I am scared all by myself.

93
00:58:04,313 --> 00:58:10,686
What are you talking about.
Stop, I will miss the train.

94
00:58:10,686 --> 00:58:14,490
Let me go with you.
Are you trying to run away?

95
00:58:14,490 --> 00:58:17,793
Then are you going to sleep on
the streets and freeze to death?

96
00:58:17,793 --> 00:58:18,987
I won't.

97
00:58:20,763 --> 00:58:21,889
Then don't sleep.

98
00:58:22,998 --> 00:58:25,193
And don't open
the door to strangers.

99
00:58:25,834 --> 00:58:29,405
I will knock on the door twice
and ring a bell.

100
00:58:29,405 --> 00:58:30,272
Open the door then.

101
00:58:30,272 --> 00:58:32,001
Then say roar?

102
00:58:34,610 --> 00:58:35,508
Roar?

103
00:58:36,378 --> 00:58:38,847
Say them like the tiger.

104
00:58:38,847 --> 00:58:41,907
I am not in the mood for it.
Stop it.

105
00:58:42,418 --> 00:58:46,252
You do that to me.
Say roar.

106
00:59:35,904 --> 00:59:38,930
Da Sung, Da Sung!

107
00:59:42,544 --> 00:59:43,875
Pops.

108
00:59:45,047 --> 00:59:47,038
Did you miss me?

109
00:59:47,983 --> 00:59:51,754
Stay here and eat
I won't be late.

110
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:54,990
- Are you coming back soon?
- Yeah.

111
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:56,252
Pops.

112
00:59:58,594 --> 00:59:59,891
Then come back very fast.

113
01:00:11,273 --> 01:00:13,673
Princess,
you should lie down.

114
01:00:17,679 --> 01:00:19,738
Yes, bring some milk.

115
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:29,951
Here's your milk.

116
01:00:34,696 --> 01:00:36,630
Thank you child.

117
01:02:11,827 --> 01:02:14,694
I am sorry.
So sorry.

118
01:02:17,833 --> 01:02:19,824
I am sorry more.

119
01:02:21,703 --> 01:02:27,699
So don't ever say that again.

120
01:02:42,591 --> 01:02:47,153
Pops.
It's late, the train won't come.

121
01:04:18,220 --> 01:04:21,712
- We are here.
- Get out.

122
01:04:44,579 --> 01:04:46,274
Close the door.

123
01:04:46,748 --> 01:04:51,019
Are you afraid of
your boss that much?

124
01:04:51,019 --> 01:04:53,989
Why come back here
and not go to your house?

125
01:04:53,989 --> 01:04:57,186
I am missing the old days.

126
01:05:11,873 --> 01:05:17,004
Da Sung, it's me.
Open the door.

127
01:05:18,380 --> 01:05:20,280
It's okay.
Open the door.

128
01:05:23,985 --> 01:05:24,952
Da Sung.

129
01:05:27,923 --> 01:05:31,723
It's me.
I'm your grand father.

130
01:05:58,820 --> 01:06:01,311
What is taking so long?

131
01:06:06,661 --> 01:06:08,026
Delivery meat

132
01:06:12,100 --> 01:06:15,126
Get up.

133
01:06:17,172 --> 01:06:18,507
Hey.

134
01:06:18,507 --> 01:06:19,906
Hey, hey

135
01:06:21,476 --> 01:06:22,443
Hey.

136
01:06:24,379 --> 01:06:26,006
The bell's ringing.

137
01:06:28,283 --> 01:06:30,318
Hi.
Meat delivery.

138
01:06:30,318 --> 01:06:32,187
- Come back day after tomorrow?
- Yes.

139
01:06:32,187 --> 01:06:32,778
Okay, good bye.

140
01:06:50,739 --> 01:06:53,537
Hello? It's me.

141
01:06:56,912 --> 01:06:59,142
Yes, I just fed her.

142
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:07,121
Yes, I am
receiving them everyday.

143
01:07:10,792 --> 01:07:13,528
I come back late at night

144
01:07:13,528 --> 01:07:18,864
because Tanya
is receiving check up.

145
01:07:24,239 --> 01:07:25,570
Yes.

146
01:07:33,815 --> 01:07:34,941
Yes.

147
01:07:37,452 --> 01:07:38,578
Yes, sir.

148
01:07:44,759 --> 01:07:48,752
Is it okay to leave the house
empty for two days?

149
01:07:51,466 --> 01:07:52,567
Let's go.

150
01:07:52,567 --> 01:07:55,593
Are you really going?
Is it okay?

151
01:07:58,373 --> 01:08:02,742
I going to go crazy if I don't
have wind blowing at my face.

152
01:08:07,515 --> 01:08:12,316
Eat up, boy.
Slow and nicely.

153
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:32,941
Da Sung, hey.
Open the door.

154
01:08:32,941 --> 01:08:36,843
Roar. It's your grand
father so open up.

155
01:09:02,270 --> 01:09:04,135
Are you going to keep
on being stubborn like this?

156
01:09:05,173 --> 01:09:07,642
Damn. You are dirty.

157
01:09:07,642 --> 01:09:08,870
I already know
how ugly you are.

158
01:09:15,550 --> 01:09:19,884
Okay, I am not mad.
Really, I am not.

159
01:09:20,422 --> 01:09:26,328
I brought some meat
and left them on the yard.

160
01:09:26,328 --> 01:09:28,228
I'll get them.

161
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,257
Why aren't you eating?

162
01:10:00,895 --> 01:10:02,954
Don't worry about me.

163
01:10:03,665 --> 01:10:06,293
This is big.
Have some.

164
01:10:07,936 --> 01:10:11,072
- And drink this too.
- I like these.

165
01:10:11,072 --> 01:10:13,563
But pops,
where did you get these?

166
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:18,473
I worked all day at the
steak house yesterday.

167
01:10:19,914 --> 01:10:21,882
Really? You found a job?

168
01:10:22,283 --> 01:10:23,511
I got laid off.

169
01:10:27,689 --> 01:10:29,418
Keep on chewing.

170
01:10:32,794 --> 01:10:33,818
Eat them all.

171
01:11:11,533 --> 01:11:13,865
Where are you going?

172
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:16,737
I have a stomachache.

173
01:11:23,211 --> 01:11:25,647
Rich people should eat meat

174
01:11:25,647 --> 01:11:29,014
You are not used
to eating them.

175
01:12:12,594 --> 01:12:15,791
Nothing left in here.
Shit.

176
01:12:19,434 --> 01:12:22,062
Fucking jerk did it again.

177
01:12:36,618 --> 01:12:37,880
Get me a glass of water.

178
01:12:59,040 --> 01:13:00,530
Dame it.

179
01:13:26,167 --> 01:13:27,429
Here.

180
01:13:30,271 --> 01:13:35,732
It is better this way.
She will like it here.

181
01:13:36,911 --> 01:13:39,709
Da Sung, let's go.

182
01:14:03,871 --> 01:14:05,998
What do you think you are?

183
01:14:10,044 --> 01:14:16,711
I said give Tanya meat
I didn't say feed yourself.

184
01:14:18,152 --> 01:14:18,948
What?

185
01:14:28,229 --> 01:14:30,163
Are you a man?

186
01:14:31,699 --> 01:14:35,903
You shameless moron.

187
01:14:35,903 --> 01:14:41,442
You should
be treated like dogs.

188
01:14:41,442 --> 01:14:44,468
You understand?
Huh? Do you?

189
01:14:46,047 --> 01:14:54,318
Get out.
I said get out!

190
01:15:03,164 --> 01:15:06,801
Pops,
where are we going now?

191
01:15:06,801 --> 01:15:08,564
We don't have a home.

192
01:15:57,418 --> 01:16:01,320
It's nice out here.
It's not even cold.

193
01:16:09,764 --> 01:16:11,566
Pops, isn't it fun?

194
01:16:11,566 --> 01:16:14,736
- Isn't it fun?
- Hey don't make me so dizzy.

195
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:16,761
Now you are saying something.

196
01:16:39,594 --> 01:16:42,961
I was going to give
them to you.

197
01:17:15,296 --> 01:17:16,729
You like me that much?

198
01:17:18,666 --> 01:17:22,102
You like me even when
you starve to death?

199
01:17:46,060 --> 01:17:48,824
We are here.
Walk a little bit more.

200
01:17:56,137 --> 01:18:03,578
- This is mine.
- It's not yours either.

201
01:18:03,578 --> 01:18:09,312
Lee, gave it to us.
Let go of it.

202
01:18:10,952 --> 01:18:13,420
Who's going to prove that
Huh?

203
01:18:16,123 --> 01:18:18,557
Pops,
did you meet your son?

204
01:18:19,093 --> 01:18:20,958
What son?

205
01:19:01,936 --> 01:19:04,302
Have you had dinner?

206
01:19:05,172 --> 01:19:06,469
Have some.

207
01:19:09,143 --> 01:19:12,408
It's warm.
Have some.

208
01:19:15,850 --> 01:19:17,317
I said eat

209
01:19:24,025 --> 01:19:27,756
You have a bad cold.
Did you feed her?

210
01:19:28,829 --> 01:19:34,835
I don't know what to give her.
She's so sick

211
01:19:34,835 --> 01:19:42,003
Give her some fat
Like meat

212
01:19:42,777 --> 01:19:51,549
She's so weak so give her
something nutritious.

213
01:20:03,898 --> 01:20:09,268
It won't do her any good.
Your son is seriously a jerk.

214
01:20:15,443 --> 01:20:17,308
What did the doctor say?

215
01:20:18,913 --> 01:20:21,848
She's gotten worse,
she's on fire.

216
01:20:23,718 --> 01:20:25,319
It doesn't taste good.

217
01:20:25,319 --> 01:20:28,083
Still eat some.

218
01:20:29,757 --> 01:20:33,591
We are so worried
about you two.

219
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:39,193
I don't wanna eat

220
01:21:13,768 --> 01:21:17,067
Why are you still sick?

221
01:21:32,987 --> 01:21:36,354
The owner come out here.

222
01:21:37,992 --> 01:21:40,294
What now?

223
01:21:40,294 --> 01:21:42,558
I don't need you.
I need to see your boss.

224
01:21:43,664 --> 01:21:46,656
I don't need you.
I need to see your boss.

225
01:21:49,904 --> 01:21:50,871
What?

226
01:21:55,576 --> 01:22:01,537
Oh you. You are the monster
who ate up my house.

227
01:22:02,716 --> 01:22:05,553
Don't make noise and leave.
I will call the police.

228
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:07,521
Go back? To where?

229
01:22:07,521 --> 01:22:09,557
I don't have a house
to go back to.

230
01:22:09,557 --> 01:22:10,424
Spit up my house.

231
01:22:10,424 --> 01:22:13,027
I won't go till you give it back!

232
01:22:13,027 --> 01:22:15,196
I think it's already
taken care of.

233
01:22:15,196 --> 01:22:16,330
I don't care.
Just give back my money.

234
01:22:16,330 --> 01:22:18,032
Give my cart back!
My money!

235
01:22:18,032 --> 01:22:20,868
I want to live.

236
01:22:20,868 --> 01:22:25,271
You push me into the
corner with nowhere to hide.

237
01:22:29,043 --> 01:22:31,876
Here, have a meal on the way.

238
01:22:36,283 --> 01:22:38,683
This is meat too.
Why don't you eat?

239
01:22:39,286 --> 01:22:43,224
I want the same meat
that I ate there.

240
01:22:43,224 --> 01:22:47,761
It's meat too.
They are not different. Eat

241
01:22:47,761 --> 01:22:49,063
I won't.

242
01:22:49,063 --> 01:22:51,365
- Eat
- I won't.

243
01:22:51,365 --> 01:22:52,957
Eat!

244
01:22:57,071 --> 01:22:58,834
Stop crying.
Stop.

245
01:22:59,473 --> 01:23:00,371
Now eat

246
01:23:03,711 --> 01:23:08,671
I won't eat meat
I won't ever talk about it.

247
01:24:08,676 --> 01:24:10,344
- Oh, my god.
- Excuse me.

248
01:24:10,344 --> 01:24:11,645
Let me ask you
a favor madam

249
01:24:11,645 --> 01:24:16,050
May I have some of those meat
that you are giving your dog?

250
01:24:16,050 --> 01:24:16,784
What?

251
01:24:16,784 --> 01:24:18,619
Give me bones.
It's fine.

252
01:24:18,619 --> 01:24:21,053
Go away.
What are you doing?

253
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:28,023
Oh, my god.

254
01:24:29,029 --> 01:24:30,428
I will only take little bit.

255
01:24:55,456 --> 01:24:57,856
Da Sung, get up.

256
01:25:06,667 --> 01:25:10,330
I got you what you wanted.
Hurry and eat

257
01:25:12,406 --> 01:25:13,566
I won't eat

258
01:25:14,742 --> 01:25:18,269
It's okay.
Eat now little one.

259
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:21,746
I said I won't eat

260
01:25:22,916 --> 01:25:26,443
You eat meat and get well.

261
01:25:34,928 --> 01:25:37,590
This will be your last.

262
01:25:38,399 --> 01:25:41,698
Don't ever say
you want this meat

263
01:25:42,336 --> 01:25:45,772
That's it.
Eat them.

264
01:25:58,986 --> 01:26:03,616
Hey, son.
Where are you?

265
01:26:06,260 --> 01:26:11,425
My son.
Son...

266
01:26:45,065 --> 01:26:47,659
The more you eat
the more you get sick.

267
01:26:55,776 --> 01:26:57,243
It's only for a while.

268
01:26:57,845 --> 01:27:05,652
They go nuts but everyone
gives up at the end.

269
01:27:05,652 --> 01:27:08,519
They don't last for long.

270
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:29,810
What are you here for?
Is she sick?

271
01:27:29,810 --> 01:27:30,970
Bring the doctor in very fast.

272
01:27:31,512 --> 01:27:33,180
Please show us your
medical insurance.

273
01:27:33,180 --> 01:27:36,206
Bull shit.
Call the doctor now!

274
01:27:37,251 --> 01:27:41,654
You did a patriotic work.

275
01:28:04,011 --> 01:28:05,569
What did you feed her today?

276
01:28:06,580 --> 01:28:07,512
Ribs.

277
01:28:07,881 --> 01:28:08,745
Really?

278
01:28:10,951 --> 01:28:14,521
Was she sick before she eat
meat or after she ate them?

279
01:28:14,521 --> 01:28:18,559
She's always sick
but she likes meat

280
01:28:18,559 --> 01:28:21,494
You will only spent more
money with check ups.

281
01:28:22,095 --> 01:28:25,462
It's not because of food
she ate so give her a ringer.

282
01:28:27,034 --> 01:28:28,058
I will be upstairs.
Call me if anything happens.

283
01:28:29,870 --> 01:28:32,395
But why is she so sick?

284
01:28:35,909 --> 01:28:38,901
Children tend
to say those things.

285
01:29:07,841 --> 01:29:09,331
Here, have some water.

286
01:29:11,712 --> 01:29:15,079
- Pops.
- Yeah?

287
01:29:15,449 --> 01:29:18,282
Don't go anywhere.

288
01:29:48,515 --> 01:29:49,846
My baby. Get up.

289
01:29:50,450 --> 01:29:51,451
Da Sung!

290
01:29:51,451 --> 01:29:54,852
Open your eyes.
Get up.

291
01:29:55,322 --> 01:29:56,289
Da Sung.

292
01:29:56,757 --> 01:29:58,987
Open your eyes?

293
01:30:00,561 --> 01:30:01,755
Meat

294
01:30:02,663 --> 01:30:03,493
What?

295
01:30:04,865 --> 01:30:10,201
I want meat, pops.

296
01:30:18,512 --> 01:30:19,740
You drive the car.

297
01:30:21,481 --> 01:30:24,314
Don't wait up.

298
01:30:48,175 --> 01:30:53,135
It's the last. It really is.
I will only take little bit.

299
01:31:03,223 --> 01:31:04,747
Shit.

300
01:31:05,192 --> 01:31:07,524
Shit.

301
01:31:14,568 --> 01:31:17,799
So bite me. Bite me I said.

302
01:31:19,072 --> 01:31:28,743
My poor little thing
only wants dog food.

303
01:31:29,583 --> 01:31:31,881
My precious baby.

304
01:31:32,719 --> 01:31:36,323
Seeing her like that
I can't live anymore.

305
01:31:36,323 --> 01:31:38,484
I am going to kill you.

306
01:32:33,747 --> 01:32:37,911
Baby. Open your eyes.

307
01:32:40,187 --> 01:32:41,313
Baby hey, Da Sung.

308
01:32:42,689 --> 01:32:47,160
Here's meat
I brought them for you.

309
01:32:47,160 --> 01:32:49,253
Hurry open up your eyes.

310
01:33:05,479 --> 01:33:06,377
Baby...

311
01:33:09,549 --> 01:33:11,312
Here's your meat

312
01:33:13,086 --> 01:33:16,988
I brought them here.
Why aren't you eating?

313
01:33:17,657 --> 01:33:18,988
Get up and eat

314
01:33:21,294 --> 01:33:23,262
Baby, come back.

315
01:33:23,563 --> 01:33:25,198
Hey, Da Sung.

316
01:33:25,198 --> 01:33:28,099
Baby, my baby.

317
01:33:28,401 --> 01:33:30,096
Da Sung, get up.

318
01:33:36,843 --> 01:33:41,615
You said you wanted meat
and why aren't you eating it?

319
01:33:41,615 --> 01:33:43,105
Get up.

320
01:33:51,925 --> 01:33:55,128
I wish I didn't go.
I should have stayed here.

321
01:33:55,128 --> 01:33:57,289
You were always scared
of being alone.

322
01:33:57,798 --> 01:34:00,631
Why did you go by yourself?

323
01:34:04,437 --> 01:34:09,431
You might even get tumbled
down on the way.

324
01:34:11,645 --> 01:34:14,047
I should have stayed here.

325
01:34:14,047 --> 01:34:16,709
How can you go
there by yourself?

326
01:34:29,062 --> 01:34:32,031
Da Sung...

327
01:35:06,099 --> 01:35:08,659
He said he will come.

328
01:35:09,569 --> 01:35:11,036
He said he will even

329
01:35:12,138 --> 01:35:18,941
if he had to go way
round the other way.

330
