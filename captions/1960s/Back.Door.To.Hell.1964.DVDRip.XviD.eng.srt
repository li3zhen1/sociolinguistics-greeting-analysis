We need that radio down there.

513
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:07,826
We haven't got the stuff to take it
by a frontal assault...

514
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:10,263
<i>so there's only one other way.</i>

515
00:56:10,367 --> 00:56:12,335
If we can get in there
before dawn...

516
00:56:12,435 --> 00:56:14,562
there's a good chance we can get
to the radio, send a message...

517
00:56:14,671 --> 00:56:16,764
and get out before they know it.

518
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:21,141
What if they catch us
at the radio?

519
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:26,173
We can use Paco and his men
for diversion fire to cover us.

520
00:56:28,151 --> 00:56:32,451
Look, anything can happen.
I'm not even sure it's worth a chance.

521
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:35,353
You could call it quits right now
and be justified in doing so.

522
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:37,392
What do you think, Lieutenant?

523
00:56:42,165 --> 00:56:44,133
I'd like to try it.

524
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:47,169
I don't know
if it's right or wrong.

525
00:56:47,270 --> 00:56:49,670
As a man, I think it's stupid.

526
00:56:50,707 --> 00:56:52,675
As a soldier...

527
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:55,811
what can I do?

528
00:56:58,348 --> 00:57:00,179
You gonna be able to pull it off?

529
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:02,183
What do you mean?

530
00:57:03,286 --> 00:57:05,186
You know what I mean.

531
00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:08,086
Once we get in there,
that's no place to start comin' apart.
