1
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:23,834
Kit!

2
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:29,084
Kit!

3
00:01:58,959 --> 00:01:59,751
US $2

4
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:01,376
Yes!

5
00:02:08,334 --> 00:02:09,084
Come!

6
00:02:09,126 --> 00:02:09,917
Coming!

7
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,251
The plate

8
00:02:21,376 --> 00:02:22,417
Sir!

9
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:27,667
Taste good?

10
00:04:27,459 --> 00:04:28,417
Are you alright?

11
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:37,251
Take it and go to see the doctor

12
00:04:37,376 --> 00:04:38,751
Thanks

13
00:04:50,126 --> 00:04:51,042
Can you read it?

14
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:53,917
What?

15
00:04:54,876 --> 00:04:55,876
Don't pretend

16
00:05:09,001 --> 00:05:10,792
How are you!

17
00:05:11,084 --> 00:05:12,001
Hi, Russ

18
00:05:16,959 --> 00:05:18,126
Thanks

19
00:05:18,334 --> 00:05:19,459
That's it!

20
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:27,584
That's great, first class

21
00:05:42,126 --> 00:05:44,334
Why don't we go out for a drink sometimes

22
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:02,959
It's pleasure doing business with you

23
00:06:09,959 --> 00:06:11,292
Good!

24
00:06:11,626 --> 00:06:12,959
Your English is improved

25
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:14,501
Even know of course

26
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:16,001
Of course!

27
00:06:18,876 --> 00:06:20,042
- Good morning. Mark
- Good morning, Mr Sung

28
00:06:20,209 --> 00:06:21,001
Good morning

29
00:06:23,042 --> 00:06:26,084
Good morning, Mr Sung

30
00:06:28,209 --> 00:06:29,126
Good morning, Mark

31
00:06:29,209 --> 00:06:30,834
That's good

32
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:35,792
Mr Yiu

33
00:06:35,876 --> 00:06:38,376
Ho, you are back! Everything OK?

34
00:06:38,792 --> 00:06:39,584
I counted already

35
00:06:39,626 --> 00:06:40,417
Clever

36
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:41,667
Those foreigners are easy going

37
00:06:42,126 --> 00:06:43,542
Not all of them are as good as they are

38
00:06:43,709 --> 00:06:46,459
Your weakness is too easy to believe someone

39
00:06:47,501 --> 00:06:48,334
Thanks!

40
00:06:48,376 --> 00:06:49,959
You are Shing? Sit…

41
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:51,667
No, thanks. It's better for me to stand

42
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:58,126
Good morning. Linda!

43
00:07:02,917 --> 00:07:05,751
Rose!

44
00:07:07,084 --> 00:07:09,584
There's a lot, you can learn from Ho

45
00:07:10,042 --> 00:07:11,501
He's excellent

46
00:07:11,917 --> 00:07:15,417
But I'll never be as good as him

47
00:07:17,334 --> 00:07:18,584
Though mark is frivolous

48
00:07:19,084 --> 00:07:20,084
But he is loyal

49
00:07:20,376 --> 00:07:22,167
Yes, he takes good care of me

50
00:07:22,417 --> 00:07:23,209
What are you talking about?

51
00:07:23,334 --> 00:07:24,584
Nothing. Just talking about you!

52
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:26,459
Really?

53
00:07:27,542 --> 00:07:29,542
Your brother, Kit, graduates today

54
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:34,501
Oh! Yes. I forgot to buy him a present

55
00:07:35,042 --> 00:07:35,834
I've got to go now

56
00:07:36,917 --> 00:07:42,251
Ho. Take Shing with you tomorrow to Taiwan

57
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:44,167
Give the kid a chance

58
00:07:47,584 --> 00:07:49,126
Taiwan. Don't mistake it with Chai Wan?

59
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:51,292
Though I've been in this field for years
I'm still afraid to go

60
00:07:51,459 --> 00:07:52,209
Do you know why?

61
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:53,251
Too much fighting

62
00:07:53,292 --> 00:07:54,626
and drink

63
00:07:55,292 --> 00:07:56,334
Don't fool him

64
00:07:56,459 --> 00:07:57,251
OK

65
00:07:57,459 --> 00:07:59,126
Give Kit a hooker for a graduation present

66
00:08:00,167 --> 00:08:01,667
I'm no good, but I want him to be a good citizen

67
00:08:01,792 --> 00:08:03,126
But it's better to have a whore

68
00:08:05,584 --> 00:08:07,167
I want to see him to be a PhD

69
00:08:07,292 --> 00:08:08,626
Getting married

70
00:08:08,792 --> 00:08:10,459
And having his own baby

71
00:08:10,584 --> 00:08:12,126
Then you'll be as busy as a buffalo

72
00:08:15,251 --> 00:08:16,251
People say, one will step on shit

73
00:08:16,751 --> 00:08:17,792
with a big mouth

74
00:08:18,126 --> 00:08:19,292
You go in first

75
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:22,292
You first

76
00:08:22,417 --> 00:08:23,501
I won't

77
00:08:25,292 --> 00:08:26,167
We will go in together

78
00:08:45,001 --> 00:08:46,126
Hold it. We are police

79
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:47,376
- Search!
- Sir

80
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:48,251
Freeze

81
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:49,001
That's not funny

82
00:08:49,042 --> 00:08:50,209
Don't turn around

83
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:52,667
Both of us have guns If you don't respect me…

84
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:53,834
I won't

85
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,667
See who doesn't respecting the others

86
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:02,667
So ticklish

87
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,126
Don't…

88
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:05,376
Please…

89
00:09:05,501 --> 00:09:06,376
Are you sure?

90
00:09:06,542 --> 00:09:07,834
I have good news

91
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:09,209
You'll surprise

92
00:09:09,876 --> 00:09:13,167
I am an Inspector, surprise!

93
00:09:15,709 --> 00:09:17,209
You have to work hard

94
00:09:17,667 --> 00:09:19,542
At least you've got to be a superintendent

95
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:21,751
Jackie!

96
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:22,876
She is my girlfriend

97
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:23,876
She takes care of dad when she has time

98
00:09:24,167 --> 00:09:25,376
My brother

99
00:09:25,876 --> 00:09:26,876
Hi!

100
00:09:30,542 --> 00:09:32,042
Taking care of dad in this way!

101
00:09:37,542 --> 00:09:38,334
Thanks a lot

102
00:09:38,376 --> 00:09:39,251
Don't mention it

103
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:41,084
I've got to sit for an exam

104
00:09:42,876 --> 00:09:45,876
Are you going steady

105
00:09:47,292 --> 00:09:48,917
Don't know yet!

106
00:09:49,917 --> 00:09:52,751
You said you'll go with me! Hurry up!

107
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:55,251
I really want to stay… But…

108
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:56,584
No need to explain.

109
00:09:56,751 --> 00:09:58,501
- I go first
- Go!

110
00:09:59,084 --> 00:09:59,876
Sorry

111
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:01,251
Let's go!

112
00:10:01,292 --> 00:10:02,209
Quick!

113
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:03,417
Bye!

114
00:10:12,084 --> 00:10:12,876
Ho!

115
00:10:13,084 --> 00:10:14,251
Dad!

116
00:10:14,584 --> 00:10:16,084
You should quit

117
00:10:17,459 --> 00:10:19,751
Your brother doesn't know
what you have been doing

118
00:10:21,126 --> 00:10:22,751
Still remember

119
00:10:23,251 --> 00:10:25,126
You two played cop & thief when you were kids

120
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:26,542
He almost lost

121
00:10:27,584 --> 00:10:29,459
But he still wanted to be a cop

122
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:32,084
I don't want you to play

123
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:33,667
the same game again

124
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,751
For your brother

125
00:10:40,459 --> 00:10:41,626
Promise!

126
00:10:43,251 --> 00:10:44,292
Yes!

127
00:10:56,126 --> 00:10:56,917
That's better

128
00:10:57,292 --> 00:10:59,209
Excuse me… Traffic is so bad

129
00:10:59,292 --> 00:10:59,959
Yes. Traffic jam

130
00:11:00,001 --> 00:11:00,751
I am Jackie

131
00:11:00,792 --> 00:11:01,542
Sir, Traffic jam

132
00:11:01,709 --> 00:11:02,417
Give me a chance

133
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:03,709
Please give her a chance

134
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,626
Are you alright?

135
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:07,584
I'm fine

136
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,084
Sir, the traffic is really bad

137
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:10,501
Give her a chance please?

138
00:11:10,667 --> 00:11:11,542
OK…

139
00:11:11,709 --> 00:11:13,459
Go!

140
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:21,792
So pity

141
00:11:22,126 --> 00:11:23,834
Listen. Judges

142
00:11:56,209 --> 00:11:57,209
Sorry

143
00:12:02,376 --> 00:12:04,376
It's you… You made me so embarrassed

144
00:12:05,042 --> 00:12:06,042
You spoiled everything

145
00:12:06,667 --> 00:12:07,667
How can I help you,

146
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:08,834
if you don't have confidence yourself?

147
00:12:09,501 --> 00:12:10,501
They didn't say you are out

148
00:12:10,542 --> 00:12:11,584
How do you know you'll fail?

149
00:12:12,209 --> 00:12:13,209
Give it back to me

150
00:12:17,376 --> 00:12:19,251
I will really fail this time

151
00:12:30,376 --> 00:12:31,167
Are you sure?

152
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,792
This will be my last time

153
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:41,334
Because of Kit?

154
00:12:47,542 --> 00:12:49,876
Don't come with me to Taiwan tomorrow

155
00:12:50,376 --> 00:12:53,084
Any goes wrong, you here to handle it

156
00:12:54,709 --> 00:12:56,542
Then they will follow you

157
00:13:00,417 --> 00:13:01,542
I can't do it

158
00:13:03,334 --> 00:13:04,751
Then Shing will do it

159
00:13:04,876 --> 00:13:06,376
He resembles Al Pacino

160
00:13:06,501 --> 00:13:08,167
Please don't fool me, Mark

161
00:13:09,376 --> 00:13:11,417
Ho, we can't do without you

162
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:13,292
I'm not mature yet

163
00:13:13,417 --> 00:13:14,584
Don't expect too much

164
00:13:16,417 --> 00:13:17,751
Don't think you can be the Big Brother

165
00:13:17,876 --> 00:13:19,334
by reading the books about underworld

166
00:13:21,917 --> 00:13:24,209
Anyone ever point a gun at you?

167
00:13:25,501 --> 00:13:26,501
No!

168
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,042
12 years ago…

169
00:13:31,042 --> 00:13:32,126
12 years,

170
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:36,501
Ho and I went to Indonesia the first time

171
00:13:38,126 --> 00:13:40,459
We had a dinner at a club with their Big Brother

172
00:13:43,501 --> 00:13:45,626
I said something wrong

173
00:13:46,251 --> 00:13:47,751
Suddenly 2 guns were pointing at my head

174
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:50,792
and I was ordered to drink a bottle of whisky

175
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:56,084
I was so scared

176
00:13:59,167 --> 00:14:00,334
Ho is really great

177
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:02,459
He drank it for me

178
00:14:04,542 --> 00:14:06,459
But there was even worse

179
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:08,334
4 guns were pointing at me then…

180
00:14:12,834 --> 00:14:14,626
Do you know what they asked me to drink?

181
00:14:15,834 --> 00:14:17,292
Urine!

182
00:14:21,001 --> 00:14:22,542
Drank urine in the club

183
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:38,667
Learning! That's what you call learning

184
00:14:50,084 --> 00:14:51,917
That's our first deal

185
00:14:53,084 --> 00:14:55,417
That's history Don't talk about it anymore

186
00:14:55,584 --> 00:14:56,584
No!

187
00:15:04,792 --> 00:15:06,584
Never cried since I was a kid

188
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,292
That's the first time I cried

189
00:15:15,417 --> 00:15:16,292
I swore that

190
00:15:16,376 --> 00:15:18,542
no one would ever point a gun at me again

191
00:15:44,084 --> 00:15:44,959
That's good!

192
00:15:54,084 --> 00:15:55,084
Be careful

193
00:15:57,751 --> 00:15:59,084
Hitting a sand bag more often

194
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:02,917
I've to go tomorrow

195
00:16:07,792 --> 00:16:08,751
Regular disappearance

196
00:16:10,626 --> 00:16:11,667
I'll be back soon

197
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:16,709
When I'm away, take care of dad

198
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:18,292
I will

199
00:16:21,126 --> 00:16:22,084
Take care!

200
00:16:23,126 --> 00:16:24,001
Yes!

201
00:17:12,459 --> 00:17:13,876
They're coming

202
00:17:17,917 --> 00:17:19,917
Be careful, there's something wrong here

203
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:23,209
How do you know?

204
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:24,501
Intuition

205
00:17:30,876 --> 00:17:32,792
Mr Sung, how are you!

206
00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:33,626
Where is Mr Wang?

207
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:34,959
He's not feeling well I'm his nephew

208
00:17:35,251 --> 00:17:36,667
He asked me to replace him

209
00:17:36,751 --> 00:17:37,584
How are you!

210
00:17:37,751 --> 00:17:38,917
What kind of illness he has got?

211
00:17:39,876 --> 00:17:42,584
Mr Sung, let's go in and talk

212
00:17:42,876 --> 00:17:43,751
Nothing serious

213
00:17:43,917 --> 00:17:45,584
Just hiding out

214
00:17:45,709 --> 00:17:46,626
for a while

215
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:48,251
Have a cup of tea

216
00:17:48,376 --> 00:17:49,292
Thanks!

217
00:17:49,459 --> 00:17:51,001
Mr Sung, this way please!

218
00:17:51,376 --> 00:17:53,626
Scared of everything when you are getting old

219
00:17:53,751 --> 00:17:54,792
Please sit

220
00:17:54,876 --> 00:17:56,459
Don't waste time!

221
00:17:57,626 --> 00:17:58,376
Attention, head quarters

222
00:17:58,542 --> 00:17:59,834
Please check a car

223
00:17:59,876 --> 00:18:01,751
Taipei 1086379

224
00:18:01,876 --> 00:18:03,459
It's a bit suspicious

225
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:12,709
We know you're reliable

226
00:18:13,251 --> 00:18:16,042
I respected you when I was a kid

227
00:18:16,876 --> 00:18:17,876
Do you believe that?

228
00:18:17,917 --> 00:18:20,251
Someone paid me double to kill you

229
00:18:20,917 --> 00:18:23,584
He's crazy, who do they think I am?

230
00:18:23,792 --> 00:18:24,667
I give you money

231
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:46,376
Police!

232
00:19:45,542 --> 00:19:46,417
Hello!

233
00:19:53,376 --> 00:19:54,542
Uncle

234
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:20,875
We'll be miles away

235
00:20:26,042 --> 00:20:28,584
Sung kill some of our men in Taiwan

236
00:20:28,876 --> 00:20:30,459
He is wanted by the Police

237
00:20:31,126 --> 00:20:33,251
Big brother is worried that
Ho might talk his secret

238
00:20:33,667 --> 00:20:35,709
Please come with me

239
00:20:35,876 --> 00:20:37,376
I don't want to be rude

240
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:44,251
You son of a bitch

241
00:20:44,334 --> 00:20:45,417
If you hurt my son

242
00:20:45,584 --> 00:20:46,751
I won't let you off

243
00:20:48,126 --> 00:20:48,917
Run!

244
00:20:49,084 --> 00:20:49,709
What are you doing?

245
00:20:49,792 --> 00:20:51,042
No!

246
00:20:51,126 --> 00:20:52,042
Don't push me!

247
00:21:01,792 --> 00:21:02,751
Wrong number

248
00:21:09,917 --> 00:21:10,792
Go. Uncle!

249
00:21:15,292 --> 00:21:16,209
Uncle!

250
00:21:17,834 --> 00:21:19,167
Jackie, what's happening?

251
00:22:09,834 --> 00:22:11,542
Be careful, Kit?

252
00:22:11,792 --> 00:22:14,001
Dad, don't come out

253
00:22:47,917 --> 00:22:50,501
Dad, please don't

254
00:23:08,959 --> 00:23:13,917
Dad!

255
00:23:16,792 --> 00:23:22,209
Kit, you have to forgive your brother!

256
00:23:50,626 --> 00:23:51,626
Who betrayed me?

257
00:23:57,626 --> 00:23:58,584
You?

258
00:23:58,834 --> 00:24:00,667
Ho, if I did

259
00:24:01,292 --> 00:24:02,584
I wouldn't be here with you now

260
00:24:09,251 --> 00:24:10,917
I don't know if I can escape this time

261
00:24:30,459 --> 00:24:32,667
Ho, what are you doing?

262
00:24:33,292 --> 00:24:33,959
I'm going to surrender

263
00:24:34,126 --> 00:24:34,959
You can't

264
00:24:35,042 --> 00:24:36,167
Please don't

265
00:24:36,501 --> 00:24:38,292
Please don't go

266
00:24:41,834 --> 00:24:43,709
No

267
00:24:43,834 --> 00:24:44,542
No!…

268
00:24:44,709 --> 00:24:45,626
Run!

269
00:24:50,334 --> 00:24:51,042
Ho…

270
00:24:51,084 --> 00:24:52,459
Go away

271
00:24:52,501 --> 00:24:54,167
I don't want to implicate another friend

272
00:24:54,209 --> 00:24:56,626
There's gun shots in the cavern

273
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:57,709
You go

274
00:24:57,876 --> 00:24:58,667
No

275
00:24:58,792 --> 00:24:59,959
I insist you go

276
00:25:08,334 --> 00:25:10,834
Stand and don't move

277
00:25:10,959 --> 00:25:12,167
Put down the gun

278
00:25:12,626 --> 00:25:14,876
Did you hear me? Put down the gun

279
00:26:11,084 --> 00:26:13,792
There's no more rules in the world

280
00:26:14,459 --> 00:26:16,542
You can't trust any one today

281
00:26:17,584 --> 00:26:19,792
Even my nephew, Wang

282
00:26:20,209 --> 00:26:21,709
betrayed me

283
00:26:22,876 --> 00:26:24,542
He joined up with a new HK gang

284
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,917
to try to take over my business

285
00:26:28,084 --> 00:26:31,667
As a result, we've lost Ho

286
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:37,876
We respect a faithful man

287
00:26:38,292 --> 00:26:40,334
but not a traitor

288
00:26:43,459 --> 00:26:44,542
Hello!

289
00:26:45,626 --> 00:26:47,459
Yes!

290
00:26:49,459 --> 00:26:51,834
He will be in Fung Lim Restaurant tonight

291
00:26:56,459 --> 00:26:57,292
What are you gong to do?

292
00:26:57,542 --> 00:26:59,209
Do you need any help?

293
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:01,126
Do you need my men?

294
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:08,626
Take care!

295
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:10,667
Thanks!

296
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:52,834
Chief

297
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:54,209
What's this?

298
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:54,876
Chief

299
00:29:54,917 --> 00:29:56,042
Inside here

300
00:31:05,209 --> 00:31:06,501
I'm not scared

301
00:31:06,667 --> 00:31:09,292
My boss will post bail for me

302
00:31:09,376 --> 00:31:10,542
If you've the gut,

303
00:31:10,626 --> 00:31:11,667
fight with me without a gun

304
00:31:11,709 --> 00:31:13,709
See who is stronger?

305
00:31:16,709 --> 00:31:17,751
5703

306
00:31:18,792 --> 00:31:20,292
Sir, what's happening?

307
00:31:20,709 --> 00:31:21,792
Nothing!

308
00:31:31,042 --> 00:31:32,126
Sung, what's the charge?

309
00:31:32,917 --> 00:31:34,542
Drug trafficking, attacking the police

310
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:36,417
How dare you insult Inspector Sung

311
00:31:36,584 --> 00:31:37,584
Take down his statement

312
00:31:40,334 --> 00:31:41,251
Thanks!

313
00:31:55,834 --> 00:31:59,292
How's that? Feeling different!

314
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,417
Can I give you a lift?

315
00:32:01,459 --> 00:32:03,417
No, thanks We are not going the same way

316
00:32:04,792 --> 00:32:05,834
I admire you

317
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:07,126
Because of your friends

318
00:32:07,167 --> 00:32:08,876
You kept quiet

319
00:32:10,292 --> 00:32:12,292
That's ridiculous. You were behind bars

320
00:32:12,459 --> 00:32:14,584
The counterfeiting racket is still strong

321
00:32:16,042 --> 00:32:17,126
Thanks!

322
00:32:19,459 --> 00:32:21,376
I'm not involved anymore

323
00:32:26,584 --> 00:32:28,042
Tell your friends

324
00:32:28,292 --> 00:32:30,251
The case is still open

325
00:32:30,584 --> 00:32:31,792
I won't let him off

326
00:32:34,959 --> 00:32:36,126
A bad guy for a day

327
00:32:36,251 --> 00:32:37,459
Will never be a good guy again

328
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:42,126
Bye!

329
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:44,834
I'll never come back again

330
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:32,292
Stop!

331
00:34:02,501 --> 00:34:03,542
Kit, cool down

332
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:13,584
Stop fighting

333
00:34:23,751 --> 00:34:24,751
Kit, stop

334
00:34:28,584 --> 00:34:29,917
Don't let me see you again

335
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:28,667
Manager!

336
00:35:33,834 --> 00:35:35,209
There's no manager here

337
00:35:35,459 --> 00:35:36,834
I'm Ken, are you looking for me?

338
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:41,876
Uncle Chung, asked me to come see you

339
00:35:42,459 --> 00:35:43,667
When I was doing business in Taiwan…

340
00:35:43,834 --> 00:35:46,334
Doing business? You were in jail!

341
00:35:49,834 --> 00:35:52,001
Mr Chung asked me to give you this letter

342
00:35:55,042 --> 00:35:57,626
Chung, he never does anything good

343
00:35:57,667 --> 00:35:59,751
But we are friends

344
00:36:00,667 --> 00:36:03,334
It's so difficult to get a job for an ex-con

345
00:36:04,584 --> 00:36:06,209
No one will hire an ex-con

346
00:36:11,001 --> 00:36:12,376
Don't feel depressed

347
00:36:13,042 --> 00:36:16,084
All these guys were prisoner before

348
00:36:20,251 --> 00:36:21,917
Some people like to adopt orphans,

349
00:36:22,459 --> 00:36:24,292
I like to take care of ex-cons

350
00:36:25,792 --> 00:36:29,542
Because I was in prison too

351
00:36:33,251 --> 00:36:36,626
Everybody, here's a new man

352
00:36:36,792 --> 00:36:38,167
Take care of him

353
00:36:38,251 --> 00:36:40,292
He is… you are…

354
00:36:40,459 --> 00:36:41,542
Sung Tse Ho

355
00:36:41,834 --> 00:36:42,626
Ho brother!

356
00:36:43,459 --> 00:36:46,292
Just call me Ho

357
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:49,876
Social gathering?

358
00:36:50,626 --> 00:36:51,792
Back to work

359
00:36:52,709 --> 00:36:54,251
I'm not paying you for doing nothing

360
00:36:56,167 --> 00:36:56,876
Do you have a driving license?

361
00:36:56,917 --> 00:36:57,917
No

362
00:36:58,584 --> 00:37:00,751
Whether you pass the exam or not…

363
00:37:00,876 --> 00:37:02,292
You can stay

364
00:37:03,167 --> 00:37:04,501
Thanks, Ken

365
00:37:04,667 --> 00:37:07,876
Don't mention it. There's no Boss here

366
00:38:19,751 --> 00:38:21,334
- Take it for lunch
- Thanks

367
00:39:10,126 --> 00:39:11,334
Mark!

368
00:39:21,959 --> 00:39:25,209
That's not what you told me in your letter

369
00:39:56,792 --> 00:39:58,542
Even I break my legs,

370
00:39:59,251 --> 00:40:00,709
I can't pay you back

371
00:40:02,251 --> 00:40:07,126
It's not your fault

372
00:40:13,709 --> 00:40:15,334
I'm so glad to see you again

373
00:40:16,626 --> 00:40:18,167
Haven't seen you for so long

374
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:20,001
You're still looking the same

375
00:40:23,959 --> 00:40:27,334
Mark. This isn't our world anymore

376
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:30,417
Why are you still here?

377
00:40:40,417 --> 00:40:43,876
I've waited for you for 3 years

378
00:40:48,751 --> 00:40:50,376
Let's start all over again

379
00:41:09,959 --> 00:41:14,459
Don't bother me Pay attention to your brother

380
00:41:18,292 --> 00:41:20,876
He's following Shing everyday
That's very dangerous

381
00:41:26,209 --> 00:41:27,667
You're brothers

382
00:41:34,084 --> 00:41:36,667
Kit, we all know you are good at your work

383
00:41:37,917 --> 00:41:39,584
I recommended your promotion,

384
00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:40,834
but it's rejected

385
00:41:42,459 --> 00:41:43,417
Why?

386
00:41:51,209 --> 00:41:53,001
This guy, you know him very well

387
00:41:57,459 --> 00:41:59,376
He disappeared 3 years ago

388
00:41:59,959 --> 00:42:01,709
He's back after being released
from prison in Taiwan

389
00:42:02,376 --> 00:42:04,334
and got back with his old partners again

390
00:42:04,376 --> 00:42:05,376
It's none of my business

391
00:42:06,292 --> 00:42:07,292
We're investigating

392
00:42:07,376 --> 00:42:08,792
underworld activities

393
00:42:09,459 --> 00:42:10,376
and none of their family members

394
00:42:10,459 --> 00:42:12,626
would be related

395
00:42:13,876 --> 00:42:15,042
Understand?

396
00:42:19,376 --> 00:42:20,792
When I carry out my order

397
00:42:21,709 --> 00:42:24,542
I've never thought of my brother

398
00:42:25,334 --> 00:42:26,542
Kit!

399
00:42:27,417 --> 00:42:29,542
You're not in Shing's case anymore

400
00:42:30,209 --> 00:42:31,584
Or you'll spoil the whole matter

401
00:42:38,709 --> 00:42:40,376
Sung, Shing will meet those Thai tonight…

402
00:42:40,542 --> 00:42:41,751
Nam!

403
00:42:49,709 --> 00:42:53,251
Bottom up

404
00:42:53,501 --> 00:42:54,209
Mark

405
00:42:54,251 --> 00:42:54,959
Tell us about your stories

406
00:42:55,001 --> 00:42:55,876
Let Ho say it

407
00:42:55,917 --> 00:42:56,584
My boss says

408
00:42:56,626 --> 00:42:59,001
$18,000,000 maximum

409
00:42:59,084 --> 00:42:59,709
OK

410
00:42:59,751 --> 00:43:01,751
Boss, Ho is outside

411
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:06,751
Draught beer, please

412
00:43:14,376 --> 00:43:16,292
This way please

413
00:43:23,126 --> 00:43:24,084
Ho!

414
00:43:24,126 --> 00:43:25,626
How come you didn't inform us you're back

415
00:43:25,667 --> 00:43:27,001
You shouldn't do that

416
00:43:31,584 --> 00:43:32,959
We were good brothers once

417
00:43:33,001 --> 00:43:33,917
Is that right, Mark?

418
00:43:39,959 --> 00:43:41,792
Ho, if you didn't take care of me

419
00:43:42,042 --> 00:43:43,417
I would never have what I have now

420
00:43:44,542 --> 00:43:45,459
Oh no

421
00:43:46,751 --> 00:43:48,792
You deserve it

422
00:43:48,959 --> 00:43:50,292
I don't have the ability

423
00:43:50,501 --> 00:43:52,084
It's Mark who gave me the chance

424
00:43:53,334 --> 00:43:55,376
Mark, if you need my help in the future

425
00:43:55,417 --> 00:43:56,626
Just say so

426
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:59,042
Don't bullshit. Let's drink

427
00:43:59,251 --> 00:44:00,667
You have to take care of our brothers

428
00:44:02,501 --> 00:44:04,000
Cheers!

429
00:44:08,501 --> 00:44:11,001
This is for my leg

430
00:44:14,251 --> 00:44:15,334
Happy

431
00:44:24,959 --> 00:44:26,834
Come to see me when you're free

432
00:44:27,001 --> 00:44:28,459
There's a lot we can talk

433
00:44:28,626 --> 00:44:29,667
I'm not interested

434
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:31,459
You will be

435
00:44:32,584 --> 00:44:33,626
I have to go

436
00:44:42,334 --> 00:44:43,292
Sung Tse Ho!

437
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:46,584
Follow me

438
00:44:59,667 --> 00:45:01,042
What are you doing?

439
00:45:03,501 --> 00:45:04,542
What did Shing tell you?

440
00:45:05,626 --> 00:45:06,501
Bullshit!

441
00:45:07,334 --> 00:45:08,334
Don't fool me!

442
00:45:08,709 --> 00:45:10,334
Business or bullshit?

443
00:45:10,834 --> 00:45:12,001
Bullshit, really

444
00:45:12,417 --> 00:45:13,417
Is there something arriving the day after?

445
00:45:13,584 --> 00:45:14,376
Don't know

446
00:45:14,917 --> 00:45:16,584
Where to load and when?

447
00:45:17,459 --> 00:45:18,417
Don't know

448
00:45:19,876 --> 00:45:21,876
How can you be a Big Brother knowing nothing?

449
00:45:24,459 --> 00:45:25,376
Kit!

450
00:45:26,459 --> 00:45:28,751
Don't call me Kit, call me inspector!

451
00:45:38,251 --> 00:45:43,542
I'm not a Big Brother anymore

452
00:45:52,376 --> 00:45:53,376
Where do you work?

453
00:45:54,709 --> 00:45:55,667
United Taxi Co

454
00:45:58,292 --> 00:45:59,251
Decent business

455
00:46:03,167 --> 00:46:04,084
Robbing with a taxi?

456
00:46:07,376 --> 00:46:08,251
Where do you live?

457
00:46:08,834 --> 00:46:10,667
United Taxi Co

458
00:46:12,542 --> 00:46:13,917
Someone still accepted you thief

459
00:46:16,417 --> 00:46:18,751
Thief… Doesn't he have a name?

460
00:46:18,959 --> 00:46:20,251
Don't think you are great to have a gun

461
00:46:20,334 --> 00:46:22,001
I'll shoot you down, cripple

462
00:46:26,292 --> 00:46:29,376
Don't point at my head with a gun

463
00:46:29,667 --> 00:46:31,459
If you've got the guts,

464
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:33,959
then shoot me…

465
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:36,376
Kit!

466
00:46:36,667 --> 00:46:39,667
Sir, I know I owe you too much

467
00:46:40,417 --> 00:46:42,001
Give me a chance!

468
00:46:43,001 --> 00:46:44,001
Give you a chance?

469
00:46:44,376 --> 00:46:46,501
I beg you to give me one!

470
00:46:48,001 --> 00:46:49,251
Do you know because of you

471
00:46:49,417 --> 00:46:51,167
I lost my chance of promotion

472
00:46:52,167 --> 00:46:53,417
Because you are a member of the triad

473
00:46:58,834 --> 00:47:00,334
Don't leave HK

474
00:47:05,376 --> 00:47:06,876
I'll be back to get you

475
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:02,251
Do you need an invitation for a cup of tea

476
00:48:02,334 --> 00:48:04,417
Thanks!

477
00:48:04,584 --> 00:48:06,417
I will deduct it from your salary

478
00:48:06,459 --> 00:48:07,751
You are mean

479
00:48:07,834 --> 00:48:09,251
Otherwise How can I support my family?

480
00:48:09,417 --> 00:48:10,251
You're right

481
00:48:13,084 --> 00:48:16,751
There's a beautiful girl staring at you

482
00:48:16,834 --> 00:48:18,251
Your girlfriend?

483
00:48:25,459 --> 00:48:26,334
Please come in!

484
00:48:26,959 --> 00:48:28,251
No!

485
00:48:30,084 --> 00:48:32,417
I want your help

486
00:48:34,084 --> 00:48:35,292
Can you leave HK for a while?

487
00:48:37,792 --> 00:48:39,917
I don't want to see Kit getting mad

488
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:44,376
He can't take this pressure, neither can I

489
00:48:45,792 --> 00:48:49,876
So I think it's better for you
to be away for a while

490
00:48:50,959 --> 00:48:52,209
I won't leave!

491
00:48:54,792 --> 00:48:58,459
I want Kit to see that I'm in my new life

492
00:48:59,042 --> 00:49:00,126
Can you give me a chance

493
00:49:00,209 --> 00:49:01,626
to show it to him?

494
00:49:08,209 --> 00:49:10,126
Don't you see I want to skate

495
00:49:10,834 --> 00:49:13,292
Riding bicycle with him too?

496
00:49:14,667 --> 00:49:16,167
I don't want to lose this brother

497
00:49:24,209 --> 00:49:25,501
Ho!

498
00:49:27,334 --> 00:49:29,042
Don't stay here, go in!

499
00:49:30,334 --> 00:49:31,709
There's no use just staying here

500
00:49:32,584 --> 00:49:34,834
Ho can handle his own matter, go in!

501
00:49:38,584 --> 00:49:39,667
Who are they?

502
00:49:40,417 --> 00:49:41,334
They're not good

503
00:49:41,376 --> 00:49:43,251
Ho, Big Brother wants to see you

504
00:49:44,334 --> 00:49:45,334
I'm busy

505
00:49:45,584 --> 00:49:46,584
Give me some face

506
00:49:46,751 --> 00:49:48,084
Just come with me

507
00:49:52,917 --> 00:49:53,542
Hello!

508
00:49:53,626 --> 00:49:56,042
Ho, Mark is with us

509
00:49:56,167 --> 00:49:57,334
Come over too

510
00:49:57,667 --> 00:50:00,001
No, thanks I am not interested…

511
00:50:00,459 --> 00:50:01,917
You may not interested in business

512
00:50:02,251 --> 00:50:03,501
How about your brother?

513
00:50:03,626 --> 00:50:04,667
Doesn't it raise your interest?

514
00:50:04,959 --> 00:50:06,667
I'll wait for you!

515
00:50:07,167 --> 00:50:08,376
OK!

516
00:50:09,501 --> 00:50:10,417
Ken, I want to go out for a while

517
00:50:12,584 --> 00:50:14,709
You have to have principle, don't be afraid

518
00:50:16,084 --> 00:50:17,376
Be straight!

519
00:50:20,501 --> 00:50:22,542
Ho, please!

520
00:50:25,751 --> 00:50:29,876
You'll never be cleaned once
you belong to the underworld

521
00:50:57,834 --> 00:50:58,626
Ho!

522
00:50:58,709 --> 00:50:59,626
Ho!

523
00:51:00,917 --> 00:51:03,084
Ho, so glad you're back

524
00:51:03,876 --> 00:51:05,042
How are you, Mr Yiu?

525
00:51:05,417 --> 00:51:07,751
Fine, thanks

526
00:51:08,251 --> 00:51:09,626
Come, talk to Shing!

527
00:51:11,542 --> 00:51:13,084
Not you?

528
00:51:14,584 --> 00:51:16,251
It's the same as talking to Shing

529
00:51:16,584 --> 00:51:20,417
I'm too old to make decisions

530
00:51:21,251 --> 00:51:22,417
Ho, sit please

531
00:51:25,251 --> 00:51:26,417
We can make big money

532
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:28,876
I really hope to cooperate with you again

533
00:51:30,501 --> 00:51:31,459
How?

534
00:51:31,834 --> 00:51:33,334
You're still our Big Brother

535
00:51:33,459 --> 00:51:34,959
Mark handles the trafficking of money

536
00:51:35,667 --> 00:51:39,792
I'll take care of the drugs,
make money for our company

537
00:51:40,292 --> 00:51:43,001
We need you to contact the old clients

538
00:51:44,959 --> 00:51:46,792
You haven't got to the point yet

539
00:51:48,792 --> 00:51:50,459
With your brother's assistance

540
00:51:50,584 --> 00:51:51,792
That would be perfect!

541
00:51:52,959 --> 00:51:53,834
What else to have your

542
00:51:53,876 --> 00:51:55,626
own man in the police!

543
00:51:58,959 --> 00:52:00,792
Come, I have something to tell you

544
00:52:11,209 --> 00:52:12,584
How about if I don't accept?

545
00:52:15,417 --> 00:52:16,209
Ho

546
00:52:16,376 --> 00:52:18,417
I kept Mark because of you

547
00:52:20,126 --> 00:52:22,501
Your brother is following everything

548
00:52:23,334 --> 00:52:26,167
If it wasn't you, he's dead already!

549
00:52:29,001 --> 00:52:34,459
Shing, one is my brother the other is my friend

550
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:35,501
How would I walk out this door

551
00:52:35,626 --> 00:52:37,501
if I said yes?

552
00:52:39,167 --> 00:52:40,292
It doesn't matter for you to insult me

553
00:52:41,001 --> 00:52:42,501
But not my friend

554
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,501
If you hurt my brother

555
00:52:53,626 --> 00:52:55,376
You won't live long

556
00:53:26,209 --> 00:53:28,042
We've wanted Mark Lee

557
00:53:28,376 --> 00:53:29,542
for 3 years

558
00:53:29,834 --> 00:53:32,792
But we can't take him back legally

559
00:53:33,292 --> 00:53:34,126
Otherwise,

560
00:53:34,417 --> 00:53:37,251
we can control the syndicate

561
00:53:37,417 --> 00:53:38,584
The Roc Police Dept is willing
to give information

562
00:53:38,751 --> 00:53:41,167
to the Interpol to the Hong Kong Government

563
00:53:41,417 --> 00:53:43,751
The US Government has also taken action

564
00:53:43,917 --> 00:53:44,751
I see!

565
00:53:44,917 --> 00:53:46,917
We've some information recently

566
00:53:47,084 --> 00:53:50,542
in 2 days there'll be counterfeit
shipped to Taiwan

567
00:53:51,209 --> 00:53:52,917
and 500 kg heroin!

568
00:53:53,584 --> 00:53:55,667
Though I can't do this case myself

569
00:53:56,376 --> 00:53:57,584
I hope to see

570
00:53:57,751 --> 00:53:59,584
Mark and his men being charged

571
00:54:06,917 --> 00:54:08,584
Boss, Ho is too much

572
00:54:08,751 --> 00:54:09,917
Let's kill him

573
00:54:10,751 --> 00:54:13,584
Not necessary

574
00:54:23,959 --> 00:54:25,209
Do as we plan

575
00:54:34,917 --> 00:54:37,292
I gave you the money already

576
00:54:37,459 --> 00:54:39,042
Where do we load the thing?

577
00:54:41,792 --> 00:54:43,709
I'll give you the address

578
00:54:48,292 --> 00:54:49,584
Get in!

579
00:54:55,459 --> 00:54:56,376
Come back!

580
00:55:02,334 --> 00:55:03,334
Did you have dinner yet?

581
00:55:09,459 --> 00:55:10,459
What are you doing?

582
00:55:44,459 --> 00:55:46,834
Mr Mok, it's Kit, I've got hints

583
00:55:47,251 --> 00:55:49,209
That Thai will deal with Shing tomorrow

584
00:55:49,459 --> 00:55:51,709
Time and location should be…

585
00:55:51,876 --> 00:55:53,709
OK, you hand in the hints tomorrow

586
00:55:53,876 --> 00:55:55,209
and there will be no concern of yours

587
00:55:55,292 --> 00:55:56,001
Why?

588
00:55:56,042 --> 00:55:57,042
You are not involved

589
00:55:57,376 --> 00:55:58,792
I'm afraid that you'll spoil the whole thing

590
00:55:59,709 --> 00:56:00,709
Give me a chance?

591
00:56:00,751 --> 00:56:01,584
I have told you that

592
00:56:01,626 --> 00:56:03,667
There is no hero in the police

593
00:56:03,709 --> 00:56:04,959
What are you doing now?

594
00:56:31,917 --> 00:56:33,584
Do you know that today is my birthday?

595
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:02,542
Can you look at me?

596
00:57:02,584 --> 00:57:03,876
You'll look

597
00:57:03,917 --> 00:57:05,584
at vase

598
00:57:05,626 --> 00:57:07,792
This is your home, not the police barrack

599
00:57:09,917 --> 00:57:13,167
You even forget my birthday

600
00:57:24,292 --> 00:57:25,376
Jackie

601
00:57:31,459 --> 00:57:32,792
Happy birthday

602
00:57:36,667 --> 00:57:37,459
I didn't forget

603
00:57:51,042 --> 00:57:53,417
Blow out the candles

604
00:58:06,959 --> 00:58:07,751
What wish did you make?

605
00:58:07,792 --> 00:58:09,376
You really want to know?

606
00:58:09,542 --> 00:58:10,459
What is it?

607
00:58:10,917 --> 00:58:12,917
Promise not to lose your temper

608
00:58:13,001 --> 00:58:14,001
Say it

609
00:58:16,584 --> 00:58:19,126
The reunion of the two of you

610
00:58:26,876 --> 00:58:27,959
Don't be angry

611
00:58:28,667 --> 00:58:29,709
Nothing

612
00:58:30,792 --> 00:58:33,251
Don't get angry on my birthday

613
00:58:33,751 --> 00:58:35,751
I don't let you get angry

614
00:58:35,917 --> 00:58:37,709
Otherwise I will get angry

615
00:58:37,876 --> 00:58:39,292
Smile

616
00:58:42,542 --> 00:58:43,709
Let me open it

617
00:58:51,209 --> 00:58:52,251
Anything happens?

618
00:58:55,209 --> 00:58:56,584
I want to speak to Kit

619
00:59:01,959 --> 00:59:03,042
Who is?

620
00:59:03,876 --> 00:59:05,376
Don't be mad

621
00:59:05,417 --> 00:59:07,709
Keep your promise

622
00:59:20,917 --> 00:59:21,709
Sit

623
00:59:21,834 --> 00:59:22,834
Thanks

624
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:24,459
Today is your birthday?

625
00:59:24,584 --> 00:59:25,459
Yes

626
00:59:26,001 --> 00:59:27,042
Have a piece of cake

627
00:59:27,084 --> 00:59:28,501
Why do you treat him that nice?

628
00:59:29,084 --> 00:59:30,792
Don't do that

629
00:59:33,542 --> 00:59:36,626
I don't care how you treat me

630
00:59:37,334 --> 00:59:39,292
I'm here to tell you that

631
00:59:39,667 --> 00:59:41,417
Shing tries to trap you

632
00:59:41,834 --> 00:59:43,126
Be careful

633
00:59:43,834 --> 00:59:44,792
Thank you!

634
00:59:45,417 --> 00:59:47,251
Don't trust those crummy

635
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:50,126
It's always a trap if you

636
00:59:50,584 --> 00:59:52,334
have it too easy

637
00:59:53,751 --> 00:59:56,042
Do you think I am as dumb as before?

638
00:59:56,084 --> 00:59:58,376
I only want to help you

639
00:59:58,417 --> 00:59:59,626
Help me or trick me?

640
01:00:03,001 --> 01:00:03,626
Do you know

641
01:00:03,667 --> 01:00:05,917
You are my burden

642
01:00:07,042 --> 01:00:08,542
Can you trust me one more time?

643
01:00:09,292 --> 01:00:13,167
Trust you?

644
01:00:19,251 --> 01:00:20,542
Jackie!

645
01:00:22,459 --> 01:00:23,459
Ho!

646
01:00:24,792 --> 01:00:27,959
His impression of me didn't change a bit

647
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:31,834
Don't give up

648
01:00:32,001 --> 01:00:33,251
Don't let the other look down upon you

649
01:00:39,626 --> 01:00:41,334
Why can't you forgive him?

650
01:00:41,417 --> 01:00:42,751
Let him start a new life?

651
01:00:42,834 --> 01:00:45,001
He killed dad indirectly?

652
01:00:45,667 --> 01:00:47,667
Why do you force me to accept him

653
01:00:54,001 --> 01:00:56,001
He can't blame anymore for
choosing the wrong way?

654
01:01:04,126 --> 01:01:07,626
I'm the cop, he's the thief

655
01:01:10,001 --> 01:01:14,001
We're going opposite

656
01:01:57,251 --> 01:01:58,584
I'm a cop

657
01:02:08,834 --> 01:02:10,167
What's happening? Ken!

658
01:02:10,251 --> 01:02:12,251
Your brother is having an operation

659
01:02:13,834 --> 01:02:15,084
He's now at Queen Margaret's

660
01:02:15,126 --> 01:02:16,376
Hurry up!

661
01:02:16,417 --> 01:02:17,209
OK

662
01:02:23,709 --> 01:02:25,251
What happened to my brother?

663
01:02:25,292 --> 01:02:27,001
He was trapped by Shing

664
01:02:27,042 --> 01:02:28,459
He purposely did it

665
01:02:29,542 --> 01:02:30,459
How is he?

666
01:02:30,709 --> 01:02:32,167
You can't get in

667
01:03:12,834 --> 01:03:14,501
I tried to stop him alone

668
01:03:14,542 --> 01:03:15,751
But he insisted

669
01:03:16,126 --> 01:03:17,709
I hope you can cooperate with the police

670
01:03:17,751 --> 01:03:19,834
and let us know your location

671
01:04:10,792 --> 01:04:14,209
It's easy to be a hero. Jump

672
01:04:16,167 --> 01:04:19,292
It's not the same now, you don't have any choice

673
01:04:19,876 --> 01:04:21,501
Get along with us

674
01:04:22,459 --> 01:04:24,209
And don't tell the police

675
01:04:24,251 --> 01:04:26,126
We know each other well

676
01:04:59,792 --> 01:05:01,167
What's happening?

677
01:05:07,084 --> 01:05:08,709
Don't use Sung ever again

678
01:05:15,376 --> 01:05:16,626
Stop!

679
01:05:28,542 --> 01:05:30,376
Fight with them

680
01:05:46,709 --> 01:05:47,542
Stop it!

681
01:05:48,042 --> 01:05:51,959
Can we make a deal

682
01:05:52,251 --> 01:05:53,459
It's not worthwhile

683
01:05:53,501 --> 01:05:55,084
breaking the law again

684
01:06:08,459 --> 01:06:09,584
Stop fighting

685
01:06:11,751 --> 01:06:13,251
Stop

686
01:06:17,001 --> 01:06:18,542
Run!

687
01:06:18,667 --> 01:06:21,542
You idiot, don't go!

688
01:06:23,334 --> 01:06:25,292
Stay if you have guts!

689
01:06:25,792 --> 01:06:27,042
You, son of bitch!

690
01:06:30,167 --> 01:06:31,417
Ken. That's my fault

691
01:06:31,834 --> 01:06:33,542
I don't want you to be involved

692
01:06:35,334 --> 01:06:37,084
You've no principle

693
01:06:37,334 --> 01:06:39,084
They fight because they are scared

694
01:06:39,667 --> 01:06:42,251
If you hit them back then they win

695
01:06:48,459 --> 01:06:50,042
Why do you want to change?

696
01:06:50,209 --> 01:06:51,126
Why?

697
01:06:51,792 --> 01:06:54,292
Who's he?

698
01:06:54,876 --> 01:06:56,042
Ken! Ho!

699
01:06:56,251 --> 01:06:57,251
Come and have a look

700
01:06:57,292 --> 01:06:58,209
Come over

701
01:06:58,251 --> 01:06:59,042
Mark…

702
01:07:05,251 --> 01:07:06,876
Emergency box

703
01:07:07,042 --> 01:07:09,084
Quick!

704
01:07:15,042 --> 01:07:16,459
Ken, what are we going to do?

705
01:07:18,292 --> 01:07:19,459
Let's go!

706
01:07:41,542 --> 01:07:43,501
Police. Stop for searching

707
01:07:47,334 --> 01:07:50,167
That's too much

708
01:07:50,334 --> 01:07:52,292
I'll send the quotation to the Station

709
01:07:52,417 --> 01:07:54,292
Smart

710
01:08:17,292 --> 01:08:20,459
I didn't notice HK is so beautiful at night

711
01:08:23,542 --> 01:08:25,542
But it doesn't last

712
01:08:26,626 --> 01:08:27,876
It's not worthwhile

713
01:08:35,292 --> 01:08:36,334
Ho!

714
01:08:36,834 --> 01:08:38,209
Let's start all over again

715
01:08:39,042 --> 01:08:40,376
After this last time

716
01:08:40,501 --> 01:08:42,292
then leave HK gloriously

717
01:08:43,376 --> 01:08:44,084
Mark!

718
01:08:44,167 --> 01:08:46,209
We've never been scared before

719
01:08:46,626 --> 01:08:48,417
Why are we scared of Shing…

720
01:08:48,459 --> 01:08:51,917
Don't push me, I'll never get involved again

721
01:08:57,251 --> 01:09:00,001
That was the past

722
01:09:00,042 --> 01:09:02,834
I'm still alive

723
01:09:04,084 --> 01:09:06,834
Even you do 10 times, 100 times

724
01:09:06,917 --> 01:09:07,959
Then what?

725
01:09:08,001 --> 01:09:09,751
Even you kill Shing?

726
01:09:17,334 --> 01:09:18,751
I lost my brother already

727
01:09:19,001 --> 01:09:20,751
I don't want to lose you too

728
01:09:21,792 --> 01:09:23,542
Mark, can you wake up?

729
01:09:23,584 --> 01:09:26,334
I don't want sympathy

730
01:09:29,709 --> 01:09:30,917
You didn't owe me anything?

731
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:33,876
I never force my friend's
doing things unwillingly

732
01:09:34,917 --> 01:09:35,959
I've my principle

733
01:09:36,792 --> 01:09:39,376
I don't want to be a loser for my whole life

734
01:09:40,626 --> 01:09:42,167
Do you think I like begging?

735
01:09:44,459 --> 01:09:47,251
I've waited for a chance for 3 years

736
01:09:47,959 --> 01:09:48,709
I've to show them

737
01:09:48,792 --> 01:09:50,417
that I'm not the best

738
01:09:50,459 --> 01:09:51,209
but I just want to say that

739
01:09:51,251 --> 01:09:53,126
what I've lost, I will take back

740
01:10:03,417 --> 01:10:06,292
What do you look like?

741
01:10:08,167 --> 01:10:09,792
We were scared when we were bad

742
01:10:09,834 --> 01:10:12,959
Felt as if we were being
followed when we are good

743
01:10:13,959 --> 01:10:15,501
Did you fight for a chance?

744
01:10:16,876 --> 01:10:17,834
You didn't

745
01:10:18,667 --> 01:10:19,792
No!

746
01:10:24,376 --> 01:10:25,667
I don't want to be like you

747
01:10:30,334 --> 01:10:31,376
Mark!

748
01:11:00,709 --> 01:11:01,876
What happened to you?

749
01:11:03,042 --> 01:11:04,459
I just want to take back something

750
01:11:21,376 --> 01:11:22,709
Stand over that side

751
01:11:22,876 --> 01:11:24,209
Go and get the plate

752
01:11:24,334 --> 01:11:26,334
You'll be in big trouble

753
01:11:27,667 --> 01:11:29,167
Think twice before you do it

754
01:11:35,876 --> 01:11:36,959
Stop for a moment

755
01:11:48,626 --> 01:11:49,709
Run!

756
01:11:49,792 --> 01:11:50,917
Open the door!

757
01:11:52,459 --> 01:11:53,584
Thanks. Mr Chan!

758
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:56,251
Go after them

759
01:13:44,959 --> 01:13:46,459
You idiot!

760
01:13:46,917 --> 01:13:48,251
I told you that's too much

761
01:13:49,292 --> 01:13:50,334
Idiot

762
01:13:50,792 --> 01:13:53,292
If Ho hands the plate to the police

763
01:13:53,417 --> 01:13:54,459
Not only you will die but

764
01:13:54,501 --> 01:13:56,542
even the syndicate will collapse

765
01:13:56,667 --> 01:13:57,459
That's enough

766
01:13:57,542 --> 01:13:59,167
Don't call me idiot

767
01:13:59,251 --> 01:14:00,834
What did you call me when I made money for you?

768
01:14:01,667 --> 01:14:03,292
I regret to have you

769
01:14:03,501 --> 01:14:06,376
I'll kill you if you
don't bring me back the plate

770
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:07,667
You kill me then

771
01:14:07,876 --> 01:14:09,876
I betrayed Ho 3 years ago

772
01:14:09,959 --> 01:14:11,334
Would I be scared of him now?

773
01:14:16,001 --> 01:14:17,376
You have to pay him back

774
01:14:17,667 --> 01:14:18,834
We've to share

775
01:14:19,084 --> 01:14:20,709
the problem together!

776
01:14:27,417 --> 01:14:28,417
Hello!

777
01:14:29,876 --> 01:14:32,584
Ho, why did you give me such a problem?

778
01:14:32,751 --> 01:14:34,667
Mr Yiu. I want to speak to Shing

779
01:14:34,751 --> 01:14:37,376
Shing? Wait a minute

780
01:14:38,376 --> 01:14:40,167
Beg him to give

781
01:14:40,251 --> 01:14:42,417
us back the plate

782
01:14:44,876 --> 01:14:47,042
Ho, don't fool me

783
01:14:47,376 --> 01:14:48,751
We can compromise

784
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:51,751
10 p.m. tonight. Go to Temple with US $2,000,000

785
01:14:51,876 --> 01:14:53,501
For the exchange of the plate

786
01:14:53,584 --> 01:14:55,834
and have a boat ready for you at The Bay

787
01:14:56,251 --> 01:14:57,334
That's simple?

788
01:14:57,417 --> 01:14:58,542
I want cash

789
01:14:59,251 --> 01:15:00,251
You yourself!

790
01:15:00,417 --> 01:15:01,542
I will be there

791
01:15:10,209 --> 01:15:11,959
What did Ho say?

792
01:15:12,792 --> 01:15:14,542
What did he say?

793
01:15:16,959 --> 01:15:17,959
What?

794
01:15:18,209 --> 01:15:19,626
He said he wants to have dinner with you

795
01:15:19,792 --> 01:15:21,417
OK, I'll wait for him

796
01:15:25,792 --> 01:15:26,626
Sir!

797
01:15:27,459 --> 01:15:28,459
Sir!

798
01:15:28,959 --> 01:15:29,876
Come in!

799
01:15:30,709 --> 01:15:31,626
Mr Mok, I've information

800
01:15:31,667 --> 01:15:34,167
Ho, Mark and Shing have a quarrel

801
01:15:34,209 --> 01:15:35,834
They blackmailed Shing

802
01:15:35,876 --> 01:15:37,126
and they're having a deal tonight

803
01:15:39,501 --> 01:15:40,376
Did you know the time and place?

804
01:15:40,459 --> 01:15:41,792
Later

805
01:15:43,667 --> 01:15:45,501
Hello. I'm…

806
01:15:47,459 --> 01:15:48,501
Thanks!

807
01:15:50,376 --> 01:15:51,417
2 minutes ago

808
01:15:51,501 --> 01:15:53,667
Shing debited US $2,000,000 from the bank

809
01:15:53,917 --> 01:15:55,084
Everyone get ready

810
01:15:55,167 --> 01:15:56,376
for order

811
01:15:56,417 --> 01:15:57,334
Yes, Sir!

812
01:15:57,876 --> 01:15:59,834
Mr Mok. Let me in

813
01:16:00,376 --> 01:16:01,376
You should be in the hospital

814
01:16:01,417 --> 01:16:02,584
What are you doing here?

815
01:16:04,792 --> 01:16:07,334
I'm fine

816
01:16:07,376 --> 01:16:08,959
You've a paid leave for a few days

817
01:16:11,334 --> 01:16:13,334
See, I can lift the chair easily

818
01:16:13,501 --> 01:16:14,792
You're not included

819
01:16:16,167 --> 01:16:18,001
My brother is the thief. Not me

820
01:16:19,667 --> 01:16:20,667
Why do you

821
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:21,917
give me pressure?

822
01:16:21,959 --> 01:16:22,959
If you still remember the rules

823
01:16:23,001 --> 01:16:23,667
You shouldn't get involved

824
01:16:23,709 --> 01:16:24,917
My dad died 3 years ago

825
01:16:25,001 --> 01:16:26,459
I allow Shing

826
01:16:26,501 --> 01:16:27,376
But you two are brothers

827
01:16:27,417 --> 01:16:28,417
I know this case most thoroughly

828
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:29,626
Don't pressure me

829
01:16:29,667 --> 01:16:31,376
would you lock him up?

830
01:16:32,876 --> 01:16:35,709
I want to lock him up myself

831
01:16:38,001 --> 01:16:40,001
I'll lock him up

832
01:16:43,209 --> 01:16:45,626
Kit. Be practical

833
01:17:37,501 --> 01:17:38,501
Jackie

834
01:17:44,709 --> 01:17:46,334
I'm leaving HK tonight

835
01:17:47,792 --> 01:17:49,501
You are giving up

836
01:17:50,626 --> 01:17:51,417
Can you give

837
01:17:51,501 --> 01:17:52,501
this packet

838
01:17:52,542 --> 01:17:54,126
to Kit tonight at 9

839
01:17:54,792 --> 01:17:56,709
It's very important to him

840
01:18:00,876 --> 01:18:02,209
Will you come back?

841
01:18:21,709 --> 01:18:24,001
Kit, your brother is leaving tonight

842
01:18:24,084 --> 01:18:26,167
He asked me to give this packet to you

843
01:18:26,542 --> 01:18:29,334
Kit. The plate I gave you

844
01:18:29,667 --> 01:18:31,709
is the proof to charge Shing

845
01:18:32,542 --> 01:18:34,792
We're having a dealing tonight at The Bay

846
01:18:35,376 --> 01:18:37,834
You can put me in prison if you like to

847
01:18:38,251 --> 01:18:40,292
I decided not to stay in HK

848
01:18:42,167 --> 01:18:44,167
What are you doing?

849
01:18:44,501 --> 01:18:45,334
I have to grab him

850
01:18:45,501 --> 01:18:46,667
No. You can't

851
01:18:46,834 --> 01:18:48,167
No

852
01:18:48,292 --> 01:18:49,334
Go away!

853
01:18:50,959 --> 01:18:55,001
Kit…

854
01:19:05,501 --> 01:19:07,667
Ho. They are late

855
01:19:13,001 --> 01:19:14,334
Do you know what to say?

856
01:19:41,834 --> 01:19:43,126
Do you believe in god?

857
01:19:44,876 --> 01:19:47,334
I'm the god

858
01:19:49,834 --> 01:19:51,209
God is a human

859
01:19:53,376 --> 01:19:55,542
Anyone will be god, if he can control his fate

860
01:19:57,376 --> 01:20:00,751
But sometimes you couldn't

861
01:20:04,584 --> 01:20:05,917
You'll either gain or loose

862
01:20:16,417 --> 01:20:17,251
Hold it!

863
01:20:20,417 --> 01:20:21,417
Money?

864
01:20:24,251 --> 01:20:25,251
Plate?

865
01:20:25,876 --> 01:20:27,001
Hand it to the police

866
01:20:33,876 --> 01:20:35,209
Don't

867
01:20:36,126 --> 01:20:37,376
There's a bomb

868
01:20:37,792 --> 01:20:39,292
I'm not a dummy

869
01:20:44,584 --> 01:20:45,667
You scared?

870
01:20:46,709 --> 01:20:48,209
Don't trick me?

871
01:21:26,459 --> 01:21:27,417
Shit!

872
01:21:27,626 --> 01:21:30,459
After Ho arrived, he had a quarrel with Master

873
01:21:30,792 --> 01:21:32,584
He asked for $2,000,000

874
01:21:32,626 --> 01:21:34,126
He'll be at sea tonight

875
01:21:34,251 --> 01:21:35,792
Then I heard a shot

876
01:21:36,292 --> 01:21:37,542
That's him

877
01:21:38,376 --> 01:21:39,209
Are you sure?

878
01:21:39,376 --> 01:21:40,459
Yes!

879
01:21:40,792 --> 01:21:41,626
Do you want to be the witness?

880
01:21:42,167 --> 01:21:42,959
Yes!

881
01:22:19,917 --> 01:22:21,501
I know you'll do that already

882
01:22:21,959 --> 01:22:23,167
You'll lose

883
01:22:23,292 --> 01:22:24,667
Get out!

884
01:22:25,126 --> 01:22:28,167
Get out…

885
01:22:29,417 --> 01:22:30,584
Let him go if you're smart!

886
01:22:33,459 --> 01:22:35,834
Come over

887
01:22:36,667 --> 01:22:37,792
Go!

888
01:22:58,084 --> 01:22:59,667
Ho, on board

889
01:23:00,042 --> 01:23:01,542
You go first

890
01:23:03,709 --> 01:23:05,251
You said we'll go together

891
01:23:07,292 --> 01:23:08,709
I've something to do

892
01:23:13,042 --> 01:23:14,542
I'll meet you

893
01:23:17,209 --> 01:23:19,417
Mark. Go!

894
01:23:25,251 --> 01:23:27,126
I'll wait for you

895
01:24:33,459 --> 01:24:34,376
Release him

896
01:24:34,459 --> 01:24:35,292
Otherwise, I'll kill your brother

897
01:24:36,417 --> 01:24:37,626
Don't do it

898
01:24:40,126 --> 01:24:41,751
One for one

899
01:24:49,084 --> 01:24:50,292
Go!

900
01:24:51,834 --> 01:24:53,626
Go!

901
01:25:12,292 --> 01:25:13,167
I won't let you off

902
01:25:15,334 --> 01:25:16,501
I know!

903
01:25:29,167 --> 01:25:31,167
Kit!

904
01:27:39,834 --> 01:27:41,167
Come over

905
01:29:26,917 --> 01:29:27,917
You

906
01:29:30,376 --> 01:29:32,792
Look at your brother

907
01:29:35,584 --> 01:29:37,417
Look!

908
01:29:41,292 --> 01:29:42,792
No matter how he wronged you before

909
01:29:42,876 --> 01:29:44,542
He paid you back now

910
01:29:50,167 --> 01:29:51,709
He has the guts to change

911
01:29:52,334 --> 01:29:54,042
What can't you forgive him?

912
01:29:54,167 --> 01:29:55,292
Why?

913
01:30:01,001 --> 01:30:02,459
For a brother…

914
01:30:49,834 --> 01:30:52,084
Shing!

915
01:31:21,834 --> 01:31:23,126
You can't get over, Miss

916
01:31:26,001 --> 01:31:27,209
Shing!

917
01:31:32,792 --> 01:31:35,709
Ho, you're being surrounded

918
01:31:35,834 --> 01:31:37,501
In 3 minutes

919
01:31:37,542 --> 01:31:39,251
Come out unarmed

920
01:31:53,001 --> 01:31:54,167
No more bullets

921
01:31:56,167 --> 01:31:57,459
I'm going to surrender

922
01:31:58,126 --> 01:31:59,251
I'll be alright

923
01:31:59,751 --> 01:32:00,876
You'll not

924
01:32:02,459 --> 01:32:05,209
I will have money, 3 days later

925
01:32:05,251 --> 01:32:06,959
I'll be released

926
01:32:07,542 --> 01:32:10,334
I've money, can change black to white

927
01:32:11,417 --> 01:32:13,626
I learned it from you

928
01:32:14,209 --> 01:32:15,959
But your brother,

929
01:32:16,001 --> 01:32:18,501
because of you, he's from white to black

930
01:32:19,084 --> 01:32:20,292
You've dragged him down

931
01:33:30,834 --> 01:33:35,126
Kit. You didn't do it wrong

932
01:33:35,167 --> 01:33:36,709
We are on different routes

933
01:33:37,959 --> 01:33:40,417
Yours is right

934
01:33:48,501 --> 01:33:50,167
I was wrong before

935
01:33:52,209 --> 01:33:55,251
I want to be back on the right one now
