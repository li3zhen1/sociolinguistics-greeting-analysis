1
00:00:16,636 --> 00:00:19,423
History teaches us
that men behave wisely...

2
00:00:19,681 --> 00:00:22,386
...once they've exhausted
all other alternatives.

3
00:00:22,643 --> 00:00:25,976
For most rock bands, the pursuit
of wisdom's a low priority...

4
00:00:26,229 --> 00:00:29,264
...compared to fame, fortune
and fornication.

5
00:00:29,523 --> 00:00:31,682
Such a band was "Strange Fruit. "

6
00:00:31,943 --> 00:00:35,526
- You said this is an important gig!
- It is!

7
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,353
It's a waterlogged field
miles from anywhere.

8
00:00:38,616 --> 00:00:42,068
I was the road dog 20 years ago when
they played the Wisbech Rock Festival.

9
00:00:42,329 --> 00:00:45,081
There's 20,000 fans out there
waiting for you.

10
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,822
They can't go anywhere.
They're up to their bollocks in mud.

11
00:00:48,083 --> 00:00:50,753
We should sing "Painted Lady"
as a tribute to Keith.

12
00:00:51,004 --> 00:00:52,249
Why? What's the point?

13
00:00:52,506 --> 00:00:54,913
It's two years since he
passed on.

14
00:00:55,175 --> 00:00:58,874
He didn't "pass on. "
He OD'd in a Little Chef.

15
00:00:59,136 --> 00:01:01,759
Nice thought, but it'll
bring everybody down.

16
00:01:02,015 --> 00:01:03,889
You told us we'd close the night.

17
00:01:04,142 --> 00:01:07,641
No, I didn't. I said you'd go on after
Blodwyn Pig and Uriah Heep.

18
00:01:07,894 --> 00:01:08,927
What about Mott the Hoople?

19
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:11,182
I can't move that. It's a done deal.

20
00:01:11,442 --> 00:01:14,229
We're the Fruits, Neil.
We're the Fruits!

21
00:01:14,486 --> 00:01:16,894
- You should be on stage.
- Without Brian?

22
00:01:17,155 --> 00:01:19,647
Where is he?
And where's Karen?

23
00:01:19,908 --> 00:01:21,237
It's a question of stature.

24
00:01:21,493 --> 00:01:23,782
You have to consider where
we stand in the overall spectrum.

25
00:01:24,037 --> 00:01:25,151
Where do we, Ray?

26
00:01:25,413 --> 00:01:26,955
Above Mott the fucking Hoople.

27
00:01:27,206 --> 00:01:30,124
We're on at 3 a.m.
No one will be awake.

28
00:01:30,377 --> 00:01:31,787
Lindisfarne went on in daylight.

29
00:01:32,045 --> 00:01:34,915
So they should,
they're fucking folk singers!

30
00:01:35,173 --> 00:01:38,460
What's he on?
Horse tranquilizers?

31
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:41,424
- You were to look after him, Karen.
- I never let him out of my sight.

32
00:01:41,681 --> 00:01:44,715
Forget about the album
and all that negative press stuff.

33
00:01:44,974 --> 00:01:46,005
Go out there.

34
00:01:46,267 --> 00:01:49,684
Remind them what the Fruits
were, are, will be!

35
00:01:49,938 --> 00:01:52,856
You've been very patient,
but it's worth waiting for.

36
00:01:53,108 --> 00:01:54,768
I know you want to see the guys.

37
00:01:55,027 --> 00:01:58,028
So let's hear it for Strange Fruit!

38
00:02:13,504 --> 00:02:14,914
Watch where you turn

39
00:02:15,172 --> 00:02:16,418
It might be today

40
00:02:20,053 --> 00:02:21,250
For fuck's sake!

41
00:02:21,512 --> 00:02:22,922
You lose your head

42
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,711
Then just throw it away

43
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,478
It was their last gig.

44
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:38,016
Divine intervention...

45
00:02:38,279 --> 00:02:39,821
...pulled the plug on the Fruits.

46
00:02:40,614 --> 00:02:42,606
I think God just got sick of...

47
00:02:42,866 --> 00:02:44,409
...all that 70s excess.

48
00:02:44,661 --> 00:02:47,068
That's why He invented The Sex Pistols.

49
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:48,866
That ought to tell us something.

50
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:04,464
So they went their separate ways,
dragging their dwindling royalties...

51
00:03:04,722 --> 00:03:06,880
...and bruised egos behind them.

52
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,421
Tony sold his Yamaha...

53
00:03:09,144 --> 00:03:12,726
...but he still puts "rock star"
as his job description.

54
00:03:12,981 --> 00:03:14,773
Mind you, for the last few years...

55
00:03:15,025 --> 00:03:18,191
...no one's been quite sure
what it is he actually does.

56
00:03:20,196 --> 00:03:21,109
Tony Costello?

57
00:03:22,782 --> 00:03:24,028
Maybe.

58
00:03:24,325 --> 00:03:25,274
Who wants to know?

59
00:03:26,494 --> 00:03:28,404
Strange Fruit, right?

60
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,028
Steve Greenblatt.

61
00:03:30,289 --> 00:03:31,665
Big fan of yours, Tony.

62
00:03:31,917 --> 00:03:33,826
God, this is amazing.

63
00:03:34,085 --> 00:03:35,877
My dad put on the Wisbech Rock Festival.

64
00:03:36,088 --> 00:03:37,711
Yeah? No kidding?

65
00:03:37,964 --> 00:03:39,339
Can I buy you a drink?

66
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:42,298
Maybe later.
I have some business.

67
00:03:43,761 --> 00:03:46,928
You live here?
Retired to the sun, eh?

68
00:03:47,182 --> 00:03:48,759
Lucky you.

69
00:03:52,979 --> 00:03:54,225
- How's business?
- Slow.

70
00:03:55,981 --> 00:03:58,057
English are not here.

71
00:03:58,817 --> 00:04:01,309
Bloody hell, things are slow.

72
00:04:07,201 --> 00:04:09,824
Karen still had ink on her fingers
from school...

73
00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:11,788
...when she went to work
for the Fruits.

74
00:04:12,041 --> 00:04:13,416
Started by sorting their laundry.

75
00:04:13,668 --> 00:04:16,418
By Wisbech,
she was sorting their lives.

76
00:04:16,669 --> 00:04:19,755
They treated her like crap,
but she loved the music...

77
00:04:20,007 --> 00:04:21,252
...and idolized Brian.

78
00:04:21,508 --> 00:04:23,715
That bastard was a near-genius...

79
00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:27,219
...but hell-bent on going
the way of his brother Keith...

80
00:04:27,472 --> 00:04:30,391
...already dead
from a drug overdose.

81
00:04:30,643 --> 00:04:31,674
Baby?

82
00:04:31,936 --> 00:04:33,051
Get some fucking help!

83
00:04:34,145 --> 00:04:38,309
So she did a complete 180:.
Marriage, mortgage, daughter, a divorce.

84
00:04:38,567 --> 00:04:40,358
Welcome to the Viking Hotel.

85
00:04:40,611 --> 00:04:42,484
Everything's set up for you
in the Collingwood Suite.

86
00:04:42,738 --> 00:04:45,691
You'll find tea and coffee,
leaded and unleaded.

87
00:04:45,949 --> 00:04:49,366
Lunch will be served at 12:30.
Thank you.

88
00:04:51,163 --> 00:04:53,285
Brilliant, Karen.
I'll buy you a drink later.

89
00:04:53,706 --> 00:04:55,534
Admiral's Locker at six?

90
00:04:58,503 --> 00:05:00,828
He brings 12
conferences a year here.

91
00:05:01,089 --> 00:05:02,833
Give him the benefit of the doubt.

92
00:05:03,092 --> 00:05:04,372
He tries it every time.

93
00:05:04,634 --> 00:05:07,553
What this job needs
is a people pleaser.

94
00:05:07,805 --> 00:05:09,216
Sometimes I think
you don't even like people.

95
00:05:09,473 --> 00:05:12,593
Pleasing people
is letting them touch my arse?

96
00:05:14,227 --> 00:05:18,179
- Can I have the Mitsubishi list?
- Hi, babe. What's happening?

97
00:05:22,653 --> 00:05:23,898
Tony!

98
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,854
He's the son
of the original promoter...

99
00:05:27,117 --> 00:05:29,608
...of the Wisbech Rock Festival.

100
00:05:31,203 --> 00:05:33,409
He wants to set it up again.

101
00:05:33,663 --> 00:05:36,666
20th anniversary.
A lot of the original acts.

102
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:40,290
- And he wants the Fruits.
- Sure.

103
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:43,089
Come on. Come on!

104
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:46,046
I'm at work, Tony.
What do you want?

105
00:05:46,303 --> 00:05:49,636
I've no idea how
to track the guys down.

106
00:05:49,846 --> 00:05:51,424
I could use a little help.

107
00:05:53,809 --> 00:05:56,845
Mitsubishi delegates are wandering
around reception like lost sheep.

108
00:05:57,105 --> 00:05:59,643
I'll be with you
in one minute.

109
00:06:02,318 --> 00:06:06,648
You can't see this happening?
You hated each other in the end.

110
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:08,442
Hate's a bit heavy.

111
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:10,775
I need a few phone numbers.
That's all.

112
00:06:11,285 --> 00:06:13,742
I owe it to the guys
to let them know about it.

113
00:06:13,997 --> 00:06:16,370
Some of them
may not be doing so well.

114
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,456
Desperate times best forgotten.

115
00:06:20,628 --> 00:06:23,500
I had enough rock 'n' roll
to last a lifetime.

116
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,506
So you gave it all up for this.

117
00:06:49,282 --> 00:06:52,533
Les Wickes was the most pissed off
when the band broke up.

118
00:06:52,786 --> 00:06:55,158
He'd been pissed off
since Keith died...

119
00:06:55,413 --> 00:06:57,287
...and Ray Simms replaced him.

120
00:06:57,624 --> 00:06:59,663
He swears he doesn't miss it.

121
00:07:00,085 --> 00:07:01,994
Well, his wife believes him.

122
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,208
You could break your neck
in those heels.

123
00:07:05,757 --> 00:07:09,968
There's only two reasons to get you
to haul your ass up here.

124
00:07:10,637 --> 00:07:12,714
Either I owe you money...

125
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,137
Or?

126
00:07:14,474 --> 00:07:16,966
Or you want to put
the band back together.

127
00:07:17,185 --> 00:07:18,680
We had a shot.

128
00:07:19,312 --> 00:07:21,472
A real shot for greatness.

129
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,271
Don't tell me it hasn't
haunted you.

130
00:07:26,277 --> 00:07:27,309
Nope.

131
00:07:27,904 --> 00:07:31,605
I'm just glad I got out when I did.
Built up a decent business.

132
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,284
That's Camille talking.

133
00:07:36,997 --> 00:07:38,954
Is it stickier going down?

134
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:42,045
You wanted it as much as any of us.

135
00:07:42,336 --> 00:07:45,205
Money, hit records, being famous.

136
00:07:45,463 --> 00:07:48,298
Don't tell me this is a step up, Les.

137
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:02,555
You frightened the life out of me.

138
00:08:03,273 --> 00:08:04,471
What are you doing?

139
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,732
Look at all this stuff.

140
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,315
Should've straightened it out years ago.

141
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:11,562
Why didn't you?

142
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,701
You might like to wear these.

143
00:08:16,412 --> 00:08:17,907
Oh, God.

144
00:08:58,539 --> 00:09:00,329
Costello Music. Good morning.

145
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,991
Tony, it's me.

146
00:09:02,917 --> 00:09:04,994
Listen, I've just handed in my notice.

147
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,581
You're in?

148
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:09,536
Fantastic, man.

149
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,343
Can't believe he managed
to hang on to this pile.

150
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:18,722
Ray was always careful with his money.

151
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,643
And I'm dossing down
at my sister's flat.

152
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:26,267
The only thing I have of value
is this.

153
00:09:26,567 --> 00:09:27,942
What is it?

154
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:30,816
Jimi Hendrix's tooth.

155
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,480
There was a fight in a club
on Oxford Street.

156
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:36,113
Somebody planked him and I picked it up.

157
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:38,445
I knew he was a genius even then.

158
00:09:38,703 --> 00:09:40,696
You think it'd fetch
a fortune, right?

159
00:09:40,955 --> 00:09:43,625
Absolutely. No two ways about it.

160
00:09:46,628 --> 00:09:48,501
What's going on here?

161
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,001
Ladies and gentlemen...

162
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,378
...a toast by our host,
the father of the bride.

163
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,968
One, two.

164
00:10:05,813 --> 00:10:07,142
Hello, Wembley.

165
00:10:12,614 --> 00:10:14,073
As you know, I'm a man of music...

166
00:10:14,866 --> 00:10:16,442
...and Tamsin...

167
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,195
...is a child of song.

168
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:23,790
She remains
one of the best songs I ever wrote.

169
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,034
I think our timing's a bit off.

170
00:10:27,169 --> 00:10:30,004
Well, I should say, co-wrote...

171
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:31,667
...with her mother...

172
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:33,549
...June, who we're...

173
00:10:34,927 --> 00:10:37,714
...lucky enough to have
with us today.

174
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:40,179
What was the name
of his band?

175
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:44,181
Trying to remember.
It's driving me crazy.

176
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:45,516
Strange Fruit.

177
00:10:46,813 --> 00:10:48,308
- Strange...?
- Fruit.

178
00:10:48,524 --> 00:10:50,517
I'd like to read this,
which is...

179
00:10:50,777 --> 00:10:55,188
...from my first solo album,
Taking Wing.

180
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:56,936
Thank you.

181
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:00,067
"Love is the heat...

182
00:11:00,703 --> 00:11:02,991
...that melts the wax of wings.

183
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:06,241
Fly close to that heat...

184
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,576
...dear girl, fly close.

185
00:11:09,504 --> 00:11:11,082
For when the smoke clears...

186
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,213
...what remains?

187
00:11:13,467 --> 00:11:17,049
The sweet kissing breath
of lips and thighs...

188
00:11:17,303 --> 00:11:21,467
...and sky-blue eyes that love. "

189
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:44,487
- You're ex-directory, obviously.
- No, it's cool.

190
00:11:44,747 --> 00:11:47,286
Why don't we talk in the crypt?

191
00:11:48,752 --> 00:11:51,456
Tony's trying to get the Fruits
together for a reunion.

192
00:11:53,464 --> 00:11:54,329
Really?

193
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,050
Have you spoken to Les?

194
00:11:58,469 --> 00:12:01,921
We wanted to talk to you first,
naturally.

195
00:12:02,181 --> 00:12:05,265
It was always complex karma
between him and me...

196
00:12:05,518 --> 00:12:07,677
...from the moment I joined the band.

197
00:12:07,938 --> 00:12:10,429
It was long ago, Ray.
We've all moved on.

198
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:14,777
He said you were a wanker, but he always
thought you had great pipes.

199
00:12:15,612 --> 00:12:18,282
What are you doing here? Please.

200
00:12:18,532 --> 00:12:20,110
Hello, baby.

201
00:12:20,826 --> 00:12:21,857
Hello, Astrid.

202
00:12:22,494 --> 00:12:25,698
Hello. I am forgetting.
Did we invite you?

203
00:12:26,165 --> 00:12:29,035
They're getting the Fruits together.

204
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:32,493
Why would you want to?

205
00:12:32,754 --> 00:12:37,582
A lot of outfits are surfing
the nostalgia wave, cleaning up.

206
00:12:38,051 --> 00:12:40,625
Ray is in the middle of a solo album.

207
00:12:40,887 --> 00:12:42,465
- We work night and day.
- "We"?

208
00:12:42,723 --> 00:12:44,467
Ray plays every instrument himself.

209
00:12:44,725 --> 00:12:48,177
Sometimes I make
percussions on tinkerbells.

210
00:12:48,437 --> 00:12:51,354
This is very "happening now" music.

211
00:12:51,606 --> 00:12:53,183
Strange Fruit?

212
00:12:54,109 --> 00:12:57,359
It's passé. They're an old hat.

213
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:06,652
- Without a singer, we're bollixed.
- But Astrid said no. Not Ray.

214
00:13:06,913 --> 00:13:09,450
His last solo album was in '89.

215
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:11,367
Dying for a pee.

216
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:13,372
- Hang on.
- Where are you going?

217
00:13:13,630 --> 00:13:17,045
I'm not going back in there.
I'm not dressed for the occasion.

218
00:13:19,927 --> 00:13:21,718
Come and look at this!

219
00:13:28,143 --> 00:13:31,263
He's got it on the market.
This is all a front.

220
00:13:31,521 --> 00:13:33,147
Bet he's as broke as I am.

221
00:13:41,866 --> 00:13:42,981
Mrs. Baggot?

222
00:13:44,577 --> 00:13:45,407
Who's asking?

223
00:13:45,869 --> 00:13:47,447
I'm Karen Knowles.

224
00:13:47,704 --> 00:13:49,862
This is Tony Costello.

225
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:54,002
Do you remember us from years ago?
With the band?

226
00:13:54,294 --> 00:13:55,493
Yeah.

227
00:13:56,755 --> 00:13:59,294
Beano sold all his gold disks,
you know.

228
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,590
Well, the wife took everything.

229
00:14:01,844 --> 00:14:04,680
The cow. Lives in Wales now.

230
00:14:04,930 --> 00:14:06,092
Serves her right.

231
00:14:06,348 --> 00:14:07,676
Does he still live with you?

232
00:14:07,933 --> 00:14:09,391
No. Moved away.

233
00:14:09,644 --> 00:14:10,640
Where to?

234
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:12,598
Over there.

235
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:18,354
Comes home for
his meals and his washing.

236
00:14:19,321 --> 00:14:20,864
Where can we contact him?

237
00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:24,355
You're the second lot
looking for him this morning.

238
00:14:24,576 --> 00:14:27,066
He's at work. At the nursery.

239
00:14:27,328 --> 00:14:29,120
He works in a nursery?

240
00:14:29,789 --> 00:14:31,118
Not with children?

241
00:14:31,542 --> 00:14:36,582
If you don't put these in today,
give them a drink before bedtime.

242
00:14:36,837 --> 00:14:38,214
Remember, they don't like lime.

243
00:14:38,465 --> 00:14:42,213
Excuse me, do you know if
David Baggot works here?

244
00:14:42,428 --> 00:14:44,917
Sometimes known as "Beano" Baggot?

245
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:50,926
There was a Mr. Baggot
worked here a while back.

246
00:14:51,186 --> 00:14:54,187
Had to leave.
Allergic to azaleas, apparently.

247
00:14:54,439 --> 00:14:56,016
It turned his piss green.

248
00:14:56,273 --> 00:14:58,481
Where can we get in touch with him?

249
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:01,773
One of the girls had a postcard
from Zimbabwe, I think.

250
00:15:02,029 --> 00:15:03,737
A call for you, Beano!

251
00:15:04,657 --> 00:15:08,276
I'll be straight there!
Just turn the hose off.

252
00:15:08,578 --> 00:15:09,408
Excuse me!

253
00:15:10,288 --> 00:15:12,327
If it's true that men
are from Mars...

254
00:15:12,582 --> 00:15:14,622
...and women are from Venus,
then drummers...

255
00:15:14,877 --> 00:15:16,420
...are from Pluto.

256
00:15:16,629 --> 00:15:19,203
The others were haunted by the past.

257
00:15:19,465 --> 00:15:21,920
Beano worried it may catch up with him.

258
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,301
What you doing here?

259
00:15:29,683 --> 00:15:32,174
How do you feel about getting
together again?

260
00:15:32,436 --> 00:15:34,144
Not a moment too soon.

261
00:16:10,224 --> 00:16:12,015
Bastard. Please.

262
00:16:12,266 --> 00:16:15,969
Come on. Do me a fucking favor,
would you?

263
00:16:16,732 --> 00:16:19,352
You can do it. Come on, do that.

264
00:16:20,526 --> 00:16:22,269
Will you shut up?!

265
00:16:22,527 --> 00:16:25,446
Button it! Fucker.

266
00:16:25,698 --> 00:16:27,774
Yeah, come on, please.

267
00:16:32,622 --> 00:16:36,205
All I want is to watch the Brazilian
Grand Prix. Which button is it?!

268
00:16:36,459 --> 00:16:39,032
- There's a limousine outside.
- What?

269
00:16:39,295 --> 00:16:42,166
Obviously, Karen did this.
She must think we are so easy.

270
00:16:47,053 --> 00:16:48,167
Mr. Simms?

271
00:16:48,804 --> 00:16:50,085
Big fan, sir!

272
00:16:50,472 --> 00:16:52,881
The reunion lunch is at 12:30!

273
00:16:55,979 --> 00:16:57,603
Give me a few minutes!

274
00:16:58,147 --> 00:17:00,222
- This came for you.
- Thanks.

275
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:04,439
Try to be back by four,
even if it is your last week.

276
00:17:38,521 --> 00:17:41,059
I'm not sure how long this will take.

277
00:17:41,275 --> 00:17:42,685
I'm not to take you back.

278
00:17:43,318 --> 00:17:46,272
Costello Music said
you'd be taking the train.

279
00:17:46,487 --> 00:17:49,193
Well, there's some mistake, surely.

280
00:17:51,577 --> 00:17:54,743
You were engaged to a
Guinness heiress, wasn't it?

281
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,196
Yeah, but they paid me to go away.

282
00:17:57,957 --> 00:18:01,291
- Not enough, by the look of you.
- Never is, man.

283
00:18:09,719 --> 00:18:11,547
You old tosser!

284
00:18:13,972 --> 00:18:15,468
- How you doing?
- All right.

285
00:18:15,768 --> 00:18:18,520
I was reminding Tony about
that night in Air Studios...

286
00:18:18,729 --> 00:18:21,220
...we caught you shagging that
singer on an amp.

287
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,354
Surely not.

288
00:18:24,818 --> 00:18:26,610
Why are we meeting here?

289
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:28,778
We shot an album cover here
years ago.

290
00:18:29,031 --> 00:18:31,071
That was before Ray's time.

291
00:18:31,909 --> 00:18:35,242
We dropped some acid
in the Druids' Circle.

292
00:18:46,132 --> 00:18:48,290
Brian wrote
quite a good song.

293
00:18:48,509 --> 00:18:50,666
The last verse even rhymed.

294
00:18:51,303 --> 00:18:53,176
Do you want a beer, Ray?

295
00:18:54,723 --> 00:18:56,632
Jack Daniels, right?

296
00:18:57,226 --> 00:18:59,183
It's usually Evian nowadays.

297
00:18:59,478 --> 00:19:02,478
- And I don't touch those anymore.
- How about a sausage, then?

298
00:19:07,111 --> 00:19:08,391
Hey, Wicksey!

299
00:19:10,739 --> 00:19:12,197
Hey. Great.

300
00:19:12,407 --> 00:19:14,150
Still pounding them drums?

301
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:21,041
- How are you, Ray?
- Cool. Thanks, Les.

302
00:19:21,876 --> 00:19:23,916
- Like the T-shirt.
- This?

303
00:19:24,588 --> 00:19:27,707
- What's that mean?
- It's a Zen quotation.

304
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:32,093
Is it? I thought that was
Japanese for "Calvin Klein. "

305
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:36,883
Are we getting a table,
or waiting for Brian?

306
00:19:37,308 --> 00:19:38,588
He won't be here.

307
00:19:39,269 --> 00:19:41,759
I've got news about Brian.

308
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:47,316
I reckoned his song royalties
must be paid somewhere...

309
00:19:47,527 --> 00:19:49,685
...so I tried his publishers...

310
00:19:49,903 --> 00:19:53,320
...and I got a fax
just before I left work.

311
00:19:53,574 --> 00:19:55,282
But it was too late
to call you all.

312
00:19:55,493 --> 00:19:57,236
Call us all about what?

313
00:19:58,037 --> 00:20:01,870
His royalties have been paid to a
cancer foundation in the States...

314
00:20:02,084 --> 00:20:03,543
...for the last five years.

315
00:20:03,793 --> 00:20:05,418
He gave his royalties away?

316
00:20:05,629 --> 00:20:08,581
Gave his Rolls away once
to his window cleaner.

317
00:20:09,172 --> 00:20:10,667
This is a bequest.

318
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:13,259
Something you leave in a will.

319
00:20:15,639 --> 00:20:17,715
You mean the silly sod's dead?

320
00:20:36,701 --> 00:20:40,616
It was always in the cards,
something like this. He was...

321
00:20:40,831 --> 00:20:42,990
...you know what I'm saying...

322
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:44,867
...fragile.

323
00:20:46,127 --> 00:20:47,918
And we crushed him.

324
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:52,582
Keith screwed himself up,
we screwed up Brian.

325
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:56,420
So make it up to him.

326
00:20:56,804 --> 00:20:59,558
Do the gig and let people
hear his songs.

327
00:21:00,017 --> 00:21:04,642
If Wisbech works out, maybe the record
company will rerelease the old albums.

328
00:21:04,854 --> 00:21:05,684
Definitely.

329
00:21:06,105 --> 00:21:08,145
- What do you say?
- Can't see it.

330
00:21:08,608 --> 00:21:10,731
We'd bollix it all over again.

331
00:21:12,529 --> 00:21:14,984
Pretty pointless reunion.

332
00:21:15,282 --> 00:21:18,319
Suppose I might get
a shepherd's pie out of it.

333
00:21:21,956 --> 00:21:23,331
You hear that?

334
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:38,839
- That's Brian.
- Yes. Tequila Mockingbird.

335
00:21:40,058 --> 00:21:41,173
Track one.

336
00:21:47,815 --> 00:21:49,724
Is that spooky, or what?

337
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:55,738
It's a sign.

338
00:21:57,408 --> 00:22:00,195
A message from
the gods of rock 'n' roll.

339
00:22:12,423 --> 00:22:15,211
Oh you dangerous things

340
00:22:17,596 --> 00:22:19,754
I'm not sure of the vibe here.

341
00:22:20,139 --> 00:22:24,719
Maybe we should've rented in the
country. Somewhere more cloistered.

342
00:22:24,936 --> 00:22:28,601
What's wrong with your place?
You've got enough bedrooms.

343
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:32,682
That would've been cool,
but we're having the lake drained.

344
00:22:38,074 --> 00:22:40,363
I'm very surprised you'd do this.

345
00:22:40,576 --> 00:22:42,984
I suppose you hope
to see Brian again.

346
00:22:44,706 --> 00:22:46,248
Doing it for all of us.

347
00:22:47,459 --> 00:22:50,709
Even though you married,
he was the love of your life.

348
00:22:50,961 --> 00:22:53,584
That's very sad
for a woman of your age.

349
00:22:54,550 --> 00:22:57,716
Astrid was wrong.
Age has got sod-all to do with it.

350
00:22:57,969 --> 00:23:02,429
And if they're putting their balls
on the block again, I won't miss it.

351
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:05,054
Fuck me! I can't believe it!

352
00:23:05,268 --> 00:23:09,182
What've I strayed into here?
Night of the Living Dead!

353
00:23:12,401 --> 00:23:15,604
You big sack of shite!
Beano Baggot!

354
00:23:16,656 --> 00:23:18,362
Where's Tony?

355
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,282
Tony-boy!

356
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:21,529
Look at you!

357
00:23:21,786 --> 00:23:23,446
Big bollock!
Let me see.

358
00:23:23,662 --> 00:23:27,031
Cuban heels! He's been
walking downhill since 1969.

359
00:23:27,291 --> 00:23:31,419
I have made herb tea for everyone,
and also dried fruit.

360
00:23:31,671 --> 00:23:34,161
You'll get fat if you
just eat Mars bars.

361
00:23:34,757 --> 00:23:39,797
Well, Astrid, my wee Nordic charmer,
so you and Ray went the distance.

362
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:42,427
Are you still a road dog, Hughie?

363
00:23:42,681 --> 00:23:47,142
The last tour I did was ten years ago,
with Aerosmith.

364
00:23:47,352 --> 00:23:50,139
But it's all wheatgrass juice
and pumpkin seeds now.

365
00:23:50,398 --> 00:23:53,813
Hope you're still crazy, or I'm out.
I have a surprise.

366
00:23:54,026 --> 00:23:55,188
Eat something.

367
00:23:55,443 --> 00:23:59,108
Strange Fruit!
Rock musicians, poets, legends!

368
00:23:59,614 --> 00:24:01,857
This is your life!

369
00:24:02,075 --> 00:24:03,949
Except for these. That's my life.

370
00:24:04,828 --> 00:24:06,405
Some memories in here.

371
00:24:06,663 --> 00:24:08,952
- Don't believe it.
- Hello.

372
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:10,619
How did these get here?

373
00:24:11,043 --> 00:24:13,913
Groupies keep them on their mantelpiece.
Sent ours back.

374
00:24:14,837 --> 00:24:16,165
Look at this bugger.

375
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:18,998
Hello? Testing. One, two, three.

376
00:24:19,218 --> 00:24:22,670
Ray! Ask Astrid
if she recognizes this.

377
00:24:22,889 --> 00:24:24,431
Give me my horns, man!

378
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:14,679
No, no.

379
00:25:14,982 --> 00:25:17,355
That's not it. Just a minute.

380
00:25:21,156 --> 00:25:22,187
That's not it.

381
00:25:22,407 --> 00:25:25,028
- What's not it?
- The way you sing it.

382
00:25:25,285 --> 00:25:26,744
I'm sorry, Les.

383
00:25:26,996 --> 00:25:29,617
It's not a wimpy song, you know.

384
00:25:29,873 --> 00:25:32,707
It's got to be sung with balls.

385
00:25:32,959 --> 00:25:36,542
Given, Ray, but they
can't be borrowed balls.

386
00:25:36,796 --> 00:25:40,296
Recycled balls.
They have to be Fruit balls.

387
00:25:40,842 --> 00:25:44,887
What he's saying is Keith used to
sing it with more...

388
00:25:45,973 --> 00:25:46,838
...panache.

389
00:25:47,057 --> 00:25:50,888
You wouldn't know panache
if it bit you on the ass, Beano.

390
00:25:54,898 --> 00:25:56,974
- Pill break.
- Hand them around.

391
00:25:57,651 --> 00:26:00,521
From my herbalist.
They won't get you high.

392
00:26:00,779 --> 00:26:02,771
- Yeah, well, we can try.
- Here.

393
00:26:07,702 --> 00:26:10,406
Why don't I take the guitar break
on the synth...

394
00:26:10,663 --> 00:26:13,070
...so you can focus on the singing?

395
00:26:14,501 --> 00:26:17,917
It'd help if I could hear myself
over Beano's drumming.

396
00:26:18,797 --> 00:26:20,624
Sounds like he's building a shed.

397
00:26:20,883 --> 00:26:21,712
Steady.

398
00:26:23,929 --> 00:26:29,052
He should go back on the sauce.
Get some juice back in his voice.

399
00:26:29,349 --> 00:26:32,185
The guy's easing himself in.
We all are.

400
00:26:35,063 --> 00:26:39,891
In an uncertain world, it's good
to know some things never change.

401
00:26:40,111 --> 00:26:42,234
These stairs here?
Thank you.

402
00:27:05,802 --> 00:27:07,711
Where have you been hiding?

403
00:27:07,970 --> 00:27:09,714
Doing different things.

404
00:27:10,222 --> 00:27:14,056
Wanted to get back in the biz,
make sure the timing's right.

405
00:27:14,311 --> 00:27:15,591
Strange Fruit?

406
00:27:16,604 --> 00:27:20,390
There's a whole new audience
discovering 70s stuff.

407
00:27:21,444 --> 00:27:25,856
It's a great time to bring out
some reissues, maybe even a box set.

408
00:27:26,198 --> 00:27:28,191
Listen to you, sweetie.

409
00:27:28,408 --> 00:27:31,031
20 years ago, you were
Neil Gaydon's doormat.

410
00:27:31,871 --> 00:27:34,825
Well, you were a tea boy
at Virgin, Clive.

411
00:27:35,041 --> 00:27:38,327
- Came to you first.
- Only because I own their catalog.

412
00:27:39,796 --> 00:27:41,456
I used to fancy Brian.

413
00:27:41,715 --> 00:27:44,880
Had that dirty, sweet,
helpless Marc Bolan thing.

414
00:27:45,092 --> 00:27:48,461
- Where is he, rehab or ashram?
- We're tracking him down.

415
00:27:49,513 --> 00:27:51,341
The other guys are really juiced.

416
00:27:51,599 --> 00:27:53,010
Strange Fruit.

417
00:27:53,225 --> 00:27:54,221
Cool name.

418
00:27:54,436 --> 00:27:56,392
Tour them. That's my advice.

419
00:27:57,146 --> 00:27:59,519
Good idea. Maybe colleges?

420
00:27:59,774 --> 00:28:03,473
Not the U.K., sweetie.
Get them across the Channel.

421
00:28:04,403 --> 00:28:06,027
See what they've got.

422
00:28:14,455 --> 00:28:17,741
How do you feel about your mom
getting back into this?

423
00:28:18,001 --> 00:28:20,836
I hope we can pay
the mortgage next month.

424
00:28:22,547 --> 00:28:23,792
Tell me, Clare.

425
00:28:26,092 --> 00:28:28,714
What's the situation, boyfriend-wise?

426
00:28:28,971 --> 00:28:30,346
I've had a couple.

427
00:28:30,597 --> 00:28:32,008
Nothing serious.

428
00:28:32,849 --> 00:28:35,008
I'm talking about your mother.

429
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:40,727
Why is a nice girl like you
putting herself through this crap again?

430
00:28:41,148 --> 00:28:44,150
- Revenge?
- If it's crap, why are you here?

431
00:28:44,652 --> 00:28:48,947
I seem to have this irresistible urge
to chronicle human folly.

432
00:28:49,199 --> 00:28:50,942
I still love their music.

433
00:28:52,327 --> 00:28:56,575
I want to stand in the dark and
see an audience feel the way I do.

434
00:28:57,291 --> 00:28:58,702
Panic-stricken?

435
00:29:01,336 --> 00:29:02,533
Just keep singing!

436
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:07,048
You know why that is.

437
00:29:08,134 --> 00:29:10,755
There's a hole
in the middle of this band.

438
00:29:12,097 --> 00:29:13,923
It's called Brian Lovell.

439
00:29:14,225 --> 00:29:17,428
All we need is a guitarist
with a bit of charisma.

440
00:29:18,688 --> 00:29:20,430
Do you want a hit on this?

441
00:29:21,564 --> 00:29:23,807
Haven't done that in years.

442
00:29:28,906 --> 00:29:31,741
Now may be a very good time to start.

443
00:29:37,331 --> 00:29:39,240
Could you sign this, please?

444
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:41,613
Sure, man.

445
00:29:44,213 --> 00:29:45,790
"Best wishes... "

446
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,003
...to who?

447
00:29:48,801 --> 00:29:51,718
I need a signature for the pizzas.

448
00:30:01,479 --> 00:30:02,678
Dickhead.

449
00:30:24,712 --> 00:30:26,586
Are you sure about this one?

450
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:30,210
He'll make you sound younger,
make you look younger.

451
00:30:35,848 --> 00:30:38,136
He's all show-off.
We don't need him.

452
00:30:38,392 --> 00:30:40,433
Clive's paying for these rehearsals.

453
00:30:40,645 --> 00:30:44,594
He may underwrite a tour, but
he'll notice that Brian's not there.

454
00:30:44,816 --> 00:30:47,935
There's got to be someone
brilliant in his place.

455
00:30:48,194 --> 00:30:50,401
Ray's doing this for the boys.

456
00:30:50,613 --> 00:30:53,484
We have many stoves in the fire.
We don't need it.

457
00:30:53,741 --> 00:30:56,066
How are Kirby, Steele and Oakes?

458
00:30:57,745 --> 00:30:59,370
I never listen to their music.

459
00:30:59,622 --> 00:31:04,450
Your estate agents.
So don't tell me you don't need this.

460
00:31:07,922 --> 00:31:10,496
You're a bloody nosy bitch.
Also a slut.

461
00:31:11,426 --> 00:31:12,802
I remember Isle of Wight.

462
00:31:13,051 --> 00:31:13,917
Come on, Ray.

463
00:31:39,788 --> 00:31:41,282
Is that all right?

464
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,080
Call me.

465
00:31:44,334 --> 00:31:45,448
You know I'll call.

466
00:31:45,752 --> 00:31:48,505
I call you even when I'm up on a roof.

467
00:31:50,716 --> 00:31:52,708
But if this thing works out...

468
00:31:53,634 --> 00:31:55,710
...you won't see me up a ladder again.

469
00:31:58,932 --> 00:32:01,683
It took us a long time
to build this business.

470
00:32:06,649 --> 00:32:07,562
Yeah.

471
00:32:07,817 --> 00:32:09,477
And I hate it, Camille.

472
00:32:09,735 --> 00:32:11,726
I really hate it.

473
00:32:13,946 --> 00:32:16,652
Your train tickets
and your traveling checks.

474
00:32:16,909 --> 00:32:20,029
I faxed Karen about your vitamins,
how many and how often.

475
00:32:20,288 --> 00:32:21,319
Wish you were coming.

476
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:26,492
I'm not going on a bus
with them all drinking beer and farting.

477
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:30,161
Karen arrange flights for me.
Give her your credit card number.

478
00:32:30,422 --> 00:32:31,832
I don't know it.

479
00:32:34,468 --> 00:32:36,793
It's on your credit card.

480
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:04,998
Feast your eyes on this
magnificent land yacht.

481
00:33:05,249 --> 00:33:08,913
Tinted windows, air conditioning,
and twin portaloos.

482
00:33:09,128 --> 00:33:12,497
Not to mention an extensive
library of pornography...

483
00:33:12,756 --> 00:33:17,502
...courtesy of the Psychedelic Furs'
world tour of 1988.

484
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:20,597
Step right up, ladies and gentlemen.

485
00:33:21,892 --> 00:33:23,221
Pongs a bit in here.

486
00:33:23,477 --> 00:33:25,885
Think one of the Furs
is still in here?

487
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:27,849
That's pedigree.

488
00:33:28,565 --> 00:33:32,016
Smell that
Dettol... fag-ends... vomit.

489
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:36,405
Yes! I love the smell
of vomit in the morning!

490
00:33:50,212 --> 00:33:51,077
Wait!

491
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,209
Wait!

492
00:33:58,469 --> 00:33:59,799
Karen, look!

493
00:34:00,013 --> 00:34:01,425
Harpoon that whale!

494
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:07,306
Go, Beano, go! You can do it!

495
00:34:07,561 --> 00:34:10,267
- Peel rubber, Hughie!
- Paternity suit, eh?

496
00:34:13,568 --> 00:34:15,110
Wait! Wait!

497
00:34:15,361 --> 00:34:18,648
I bet she's bloody Inland Revenue,
come out of the woodwork.

498
00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:25,283
- What's the problem?
- I owe the buggers 33,000 pounds.

499
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:26,911
How?

500
00:34:28,376 --> 00:34:30,202
Bad management.

501
00:34:30,586 --> 00:34:34,963
In the history of the Fruits, you're
our strongest link to the past.

502
00:34:35,215 --> 00:34:36,081
Thank you.

503
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:41,253
In all the time I've known you,
there's been zero growth.

504
00:34:41,514 --> 00:34:43,920
You're what they call a "flatliner. "

505
00:34:45,642 --> 00:34:48,098
It's better than being a "wanker. "

506
00:35:00,825 --> 00:35:01,653
That's right.

507
00:35:01,908 --> 00:35:04,446
Astrid will join us
in a couple of days.

508
00:35:04,702 --> 00:35:08,286
Could somebody look into flights
and get some options?

509
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:09,951
Sure. No problem.

510
00:35:10,208 --> 00:35:14,253
And when we get to wherever we're going,
I'll need a meeting.

511
00:35:14,504 --> 00:35:15,334
Band meeting?

512
00:35:16,131 --> 00:35:18,171
No. You know. A.A.

513
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:21,343
- Right.
- No problem.

514
00:35:26,851 --> 00:35:30,220
So are you enjoying yourself,
doing wardrobe?

515
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:35,023
Trying to get Beano to change
his socks? Yeah, I'm mad for it.

516
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:37,270
Didn't you want to come?

517
00:35:37,779 --> 00:35:39,652
I didn't have much choice.

518
00:35:39,905 --> 00:35:42,028
Mom didn't want to leave me at home.

519
00:35:42,283 --> 00:35:44,442
Afraid of what I might get up to.

520
00:35:51,542 --> 00:35:54,663
America. That was the greatest,
weren't it?

521
00:35:54,921 --> 00:35:56,297
If you say so.

522
00:35:56,757 --> 00:35:59,328
We toured it on the back
of Sonic Handshake.

523
00:35:59,591 --> 00:36:03,173
That was like our Sgt. Pepper.
We were mega.

524
00:36:03,554 --> 00:36:05,048
Hollywood Bowl.

525
00:36:06,474 --> 00:36:08,134
That was a great gig.

526
00:36:08,392 --> 00:36:11,097
We never played the Hollywood Bowl.

527
00:36:13,189 --> 00:36:14,352
Didn't we?

528
00:36:16,567 --> 00:36:19,402
That's one of my
most vivid memories!

529
00:36:19,653 --> 00:36:21,361
And it never happened?

530
00:36:26,327 --> 00:36:28,237
I think this is us!

531
00:36:35,962 --> 00:36:37,242
It's a fucking boat.

532
00:36:45,931 --> 00:36:47,473
Grumbling ulcer.

533
00:36:50,102 --> 00:36:51,929
Torn cartilage.

534
00:36:55,981 --> 00:36:57,607
Dutch curry.

535
00:37:08,161 --> 00:37:10,996
My God!
It's Night of the Living Dead 2.

536
00:37:11,248 --> 00:37:14,699
I'll get some of them organ
donor cards. I'll be back.

537
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:16,417
Sorry.

538
00:37:18,254 --> 00:37:20,081
And where's Tony?

539
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,001
He's throwing up.

540
00:37:23,094 --> 00:37:25,845
- This place is a shithole.
- It's a happening shithole.

541
00:37:26,054 --> 00:37:29,922
Tell him that we started out
in places like this.

542
00:37:30,185 --> 00:37:33,470
He didn't. He waltzed in
when we were number one.

543
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:36,516
It was all white wine
and chicken wings in the dressing room.

544
00:37:36,773 --> 00:37:40,819
Is that your idea of the highlife?
Warm bottle of Blue Nun?

545
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:44,071
Actually, I prefer
a very dry Montrachet.

546
00:37:46,366 --> 00:37:50,116
If you spy any toothsome strumps,
bring them around.

547
00:37:50,371 --> 00:37:52,660
- Not my job.
- It always was!

548
00:37:56,834 --> 00:37:58,709
You are the man, Ray.

549
00:37:59,296 --> 00:38:01,004
You are the man.

550
00:38:01,631 --> 00:38:02,830
You are the man.

551
00:38:03,341 --> 00:38:05,915
You are the goddamn motherfucking man.

552
00:38:06,595 --> 00:38:08,505
Kick some ass!

553
00:38:18,398 --> 00:38:20,391
Strange Fruit!

554
00:38:21,736 --> 00:38:22,851
Hello, Belgium.

555
00:38:23,529 --> 00:38:25,107
Holland, you prick.

556
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,289
One, two, three!

557
00:39:26,176 --> 00:39:27,754
Fuck me!

558
00:39:31,431 --> 00:39:33,056
I've got me a woman

559
00:39:33,642 --> 00:39:35,302
Twice my height and size

560
00:39:35,561 --> 00:39:39,059
She's a married woman
Comes to see me sometimes

561
00:39:39,314 --> 00:39:41,389
You don't believe I love you

562
00:39:41,816 --> 00:39:42,932
Magic, huh?

563
00:39:43,152 --> 00:39:47,445
Doctors, civil servants, moguls.
They got no idea what it's like.

564
00:39:48,114 --> 00:39:50,154
Stealing

565
00:39:52,870 --> 00:39:55,194
Go and have a word with him.

566
00:39:55,872 --> 00:39:57,034
I'm stealing

567
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:00,291
Back to my same old used-to-be

568
00:40:05,174 --> 00:40:07,046
I didn't feel like...

569
00:40:07,425 --> 00:40:09,133
...I was happening tonight.

570
00:40:09,385 --> 00:40:11,010
What are you talking about?

571
00:40:11,221 --> 00:40:14,388
- I was shouting, not singing.
- Bollocks!

572
00:40:15,016 --> 00:40:17,139
- You were brilliant.
- Was I?

573
00:40:17,393 --> 00:40:19,137
You were like-

574
00:40:20,021 --> 00:40:21,481
Totally.

575
00:40:22,734 --> 00:40:24,109
Love you, man.

576
00:40:25,444 --> 00:40:27,732
I love you too, Tony.

577
00:40:29,155 --> 00:40:30,947
What do you think, Luke?

578
00:40:33,286 --> 00:40:35,029
I thought we were shit.

579
00:40:37,206 --> 00:40:38,783
Kill that racket.

580
00:40:39,416 --> 00:40:40,283
Come again?

581
00:40:42,211 --> 00:40:44,003
We were totally crap.

582
00:40:45,130 --> 00:40:46,921
Especially on "Heartbreaker. "

583
00:40:47,131 --> 00:40:50,217
- I think we should dump that.
- It's a classic!

584
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:53,636
Maybe we should agree
what key it's in, then.

585
00:40:53,889 --> 00:40:54,885
- B flat.
- C.

586
00:40:55,098 --> 00:40:57,636
The sound was terrible,
and the stage-

587
00:40:57,893 --> 00:40:59,518
Sit down, Karen.

588
00:40:59,979 --> 00:41:01,141
Band stuff.

589
00:41:01,605 --> 00:41:02,886
Crap?

590
00:41:05,567 --> 00:41:07,524
You got no right in saying that.

591
00:41:07,944 --> 00:41:08,976
Sorry, man.

592
00:41:09,237 --> 00:41:11,645
We've been around the block,
you shit!

593
00:41:12,033 --> 00:41:14,654
We know who we are.
Been Fruits a long time.

594
00:41:15,076 --> 00:41:17,651
You can't go calling us crap!

595
00:41:17,956 --> 00:41:20,281
Listen.
I was out of order.

596
00:41:22,126 --> 00:41:24,118
And we weren't crap.

597
00:41:25,463 --> 00:41:28,215
We were seriously, diabolically...

598
00:41:28,717 --> 00:41:29,879
...shite.

599
00:41:44,982 --> 00:41:46,228
You're right.

600
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:29,731
Clogface! There's more than 200 people
in here. This is not enough.

601
00:42:31,488 --> 00:42:32,402
Excuse me?

602
00:42:32,655 --> 00:42:35,029
You make me horny.
I'll buy you a drink.

603
00:42:35,284 --> 00:42:38,901
Pay what you owe me
and I'll buy you a drink, arsehole.

604
00:42:40,121 --> 00:42:42,956
Almost sounded like a band
a couple of times.

605
00:42:43,166 --> 00:42:46,120
People are finding their spaces,
you know?

606
00:42:46,962 --> 00:42:48,955
Our lead singer isn't.

607
00:42:49,756 --> 00:42:52,128
Same old fucking poseur.

608
00:42:52,467 --> 00:42:54,710
Only this time,
he doesn't have the chops.

609
00:42:54,971 --> 00:42:56,927
For chrissake, he'll get there.

610
00:42:57,181 --> 00:42:58,555
He should be there.

611
00:42:59,474 --> 00:43:01,715
Even if it's just
a pisshole in Hoogeven.

612
00:43:01,976 --> 00:43:03,257
Groningen.

613
00:43:03,521 --> 00:43:04,895
It's a pisshole in Groningen.

614
00:43:05,147 --> 00:43:07,602
The Hoogeven pisshole is tomorrow.

615
00:43:10,777 --> 00:43:13,150
I remember this old model.

616
00:43:18,451 --> 00:43:20,408
Going to get something to eat?

617
00:43:21,078 --> 00:43:22,324
Got other plans, have you?

618
00:43:34,177 --> 00:43:36,085
You should be so lucky.

619
00:43:41,183 --> 00:43:43,341
Haven't you got washing to collect?

620
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:45,100
Sorry, Mum.

621
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:10,120
No problem, mate.

622
00:44:10,964 --> 00:44:12,755
No problem.

623
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:16,509
Fucking massacre them.

624
00:44:17,635 --> 00:44:20,591
Take no prisoners,
you know what I'm saying?

625
00:44:44,289 --> 00:44:47,540
Zoë Ball here in the Netherlands,
where Blind Fish begins their tour.

626
00:44:47,793 --> 00:44:50,414
Also present,
rock veterans Strange Fruit.

627
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:52,164
All Over The World, remember?

628
00:44:52,422 --> 00:44:53,832
Ray Simms, you must be a
big follower of the boys.

629
00:44:54,090 --> 00:44:57,044
I got on their vibe
with their first album.

630
00:44:57,928 --> 00:44:58,959
Favorite track?

631
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:01,460
The third one.

632
00:45:03,516 --> 00:45:07,645
Why do they always assume that
the singer is the voice of the band?

633
00:45:07,896 --> 00:45:09,095
How do you see your career?

634
00:45:09,356 --> 00:45:12,356
When I look at my career,
I feel it's like the universe.

635
00:45:12,566 --> 00:45:14,524
Unfolding on schedule.

636
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:17,438
Sorry. We'll be back.

637
00:45:19,282 --> 00:45:22,448
- I don't know why we're here.
- Clive wants it.

638
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:24,745
The Fish are on his label.

639
00:45:24,997 --> 00:45:27,037
We're in the same city.
It's a great P R. op.

640
00:45:27,375 --> 00:45:28,573
How big are these buggers?

641
00:45:28,834 --> 00:45:30,625
They're platinum in the States.

642
00:45:30,919 --> 00:45:33,042
They don't mean shite in my local.

643
00:45:42,514 --> 00:45:45,136
That was worth an hour
on the fucking autobahn.

644
00:45:45,393 --> 00:45:47,681
They need a few minutes. Obviously.

645
00:45:47,937 --> 00:45:51,850
Well, the chances of me
getting a shag around here is slim.

646
00:45:52,064 --> 00:45:53,690
I'm off to the bar.

647
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:22,220
You okay?

648
00:46:24,056 --> 00:46:25,468
Yeah.

649
00:46:26,101 --> 00:46:27,558
I was, you know...

650
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:30,767
...feeling a bit fragile.

651
00:46:31,564 --> 00:46:32,809
I needed a meet.

652
00:46:34,192 --> 00:46:36,184
I forgot it'd be in Dutch.

653
00:46:37,278 --> 00:46:39,271
I blew it last night.

654
00:46:40,198 --> 00:46:42,868
I shouldn't have
let Clive talk me into it.

655
00:46:44,703 --> 00:46:47,193
Just seeing them, you know...

656
00:46:48,372 --> 00:46:49,403
...soar...

657
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:53,243
...it brought it all back.

658
00:46:55,004 --> 00:46:56,202
You know, what we were.

659
00:46:56,672 --> 00:46:58,960
What you'll be again.

660
00:47:02,304 --> 00:47:04,545
I've got a birthday tomorrow.

661
00:47:06,181 --> 00:47:08,340
Do you know how old I'll be?

662
00:47:08,558 --> 00:47:09,389
How old?

663
00:47:12,647 --> 00:47:13,761
Old.

664
00:47:18,027 --> 00:47:20,269
You haven't lost it, Ray.

665
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:23,365
You need the big stage,
the great arena.

666
00:47:23,616 --> 00:47:25,942
That's the kind of artist you are.

667
00:47:28,872 --> 00:47:29,821
Sorry.

668
00:47:32,333 --> 00:47:33,365
Sorry.

669
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,083
My name's Ray...

670
00:47:37,505 --> 00:47:38,502
...and...

671
00:47:39,883 --> 00:47:41,757
...and I'm an alcoholic.

672
00:47:43,219 --> 00:47:44,334
Alcoholic?

673
00:47:45,889 --> 00:47:47,632
We zijn overeaters.

674
00:47:48,934 --> 00:47:51,056
Dit is Overeaters Anonymous.

675
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,101
Thank you.

676
00:48:06,910 --> 00:48:08,155
It's easy enough.

677
00:48:08,411 --> 00:48:10,203
Just name a band whose name...

678
00:48:10,455 --> 00:48:12,079
...corresponds with a body part.

679
00:48:12,332 --> 00:48:14,574
I'll give you one: The Faces.

680
00:48:15,459 --> 00:48:18,995
- Small Faces.
- Excellent. That's a point to you.

681
00:48:19,799 --> 00:48:21,172
I've got it:

682
00:48:21,424 --> 00:48:22,289
Badfinger.

683
00:48:22,508 --> 00:48:25,046
How about the Stones?
As in "kidney" stones.

684
00:48:26,138 --> 00:48:28,594
Find someone to share
the condom with?

685
00:48:30,226 --> 00:48:32,895
I only had that
out of a professional interest.

686
00:48:33,145 --> 00:48:36,479
- Run that by me again?
- That's what I did in Ibiza.

687
00:48:36,733 --> 00:48:39,650
It's not
something you boast about, but...

688
00:48:39,903 --> 00:48:42,772
...I had the condom concession
for the Balearics.

689
00:48:43,030 --> 00:48:46,399
I personally am in a
state of celibacy at this time.

690
00:48:46,658 --> 00:48:50,323
- It's of no interest to me.
- It obviously is.

691
00:48:50,579 --> 00:48:52,738
If not, you wouldn't be using
that snotty voice.

692
00:48:52,956 --> 00:48:53,787
What snotty voice?

693
00:48:54,041 --> 00:48:56,828
That voice you use on club owners
and waitresses.

694
00:48:57,045 --> 00:48:59,748
Really doesn't bother me,
all right?

695
00:49:00,881 --> 00:49:02,458
Then why did you ask me?

696
00:49:08,597 --> 00:49:10,637
Thumbscrew! First band I was in.

697
00:49:10,891 --> 00:49:13,976
Has to be a band
someone's heard of, Ray.

698
00:49:14,395 --> 00:49:15,427
Bollocks, then.

699
00:49:15,688 --> 00:49:16,969
You get two points for that.

700
00:49:17,231 --> 00:49:18,641
- Spooky Tooth.
- Good.

701
00:49:18,898 --> 00:49:19,929
Talking Heads!

702
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:22,189
Now we're rolling.
Einsteins, every one.

703
00:49:22,402 --> 00:49:24,526
Dr. Hook and the Medicine Show!

704
00:49:26,032 --> 00:49:27,491
Objection, Your Honor.

705
00:49:27,742 --> 00:49:28,655
Sustained.

706
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:30,452
Some people have hook
instead of hand.

707
00:49:30,703 --> 00:49:34,287
It's not a part of the body.
It's not anatomical.

708
00:49:34,541 --> 00:49:36,747
It is if you ain't got
a fucking hand.

709
00:49:42,715 --> 00:49:44,838
Only the footlights up first.

710
00:49:45,051 --> 00:49:47,542
When the drums kick in,
everything up.

711
00:49:47,804 --> 00:49:50,175
Hughie, I want to do
"Scream Freedom. "

712
00:49:50,431 --> 00:49:53,766
The way we always did it,
with the amps up full volume.

713
00:49:53,977 --> 00:49:55,352
Full? In this wee place?

714
00:49:55,603 --> 00:49:58,557
Karen feels I need scale.
What do you think?

715
00:49:58,814 --> 00:50:01,187
Sure, go for it.

716
00:50:01,442 --> 00:50:03,400
"Scream Freedom. "

717
00:50:12,537 --> 00:50:16,534
And the flame still burns

718
00:50:20,127 --> 00:50:21,788
It's there in my soul

719
00:50:23,547 --> 00:50:25,422
For that unfinished goal

720
00:50:26,718 --> 00:50:30,633
And the flame still burns

721
00:50:33,934 --> 00:50:35,557
From a glimmer, back then

722
00:50:37,186 --> 00:50:38,895
It lights up again

723
00:50:40,524 --> 00:50:41,722
In my life

724
00:50:48,615 --> 00:50:49,991
It's a good song.

725
00:50:50,326 --> 00:50:51,785
"The Flame Still Burns. "

726
00:50:52,036 --> 00:50:54,276
Les and Brian wrote it
after Keith's death.

727
00:50:54,537 --> 00:50:55,450
Why don't they play it?

728
00:50:56,455 --> 00:50:58,745
You're in murky waters there.

729
00:50:59,001 --> 00:51:01,622
For a while, Les stood in
as the lead singer.

730
00:51:01,878 --> 00:51:04,796
But he was never a frontman.
It was obvious to everybody.

731
00:51:06,174 --> 00:51:07,799
Is that why he's got it in for Ray?

732
00:51:08,010 --> 00:51:10,086
The song always meant
a great deal to Les...

733
00:51:10,346 --> 00:51:12,836
...but he always hated
the way Ray did it.

734
00:51:13,139 --> 00:51:15,262
Ray wouldn't let
anybody else do the lead...

735
00:51:15,517 --> 00:51:17,889
...so they stopped doing it forever.

736
00:51:18,144 --> 00:51:21,514
All part of the weird shit
that's the history of the Fruits.

737
00:51:22,107 --> 00:51:24,146
It'd be cool to see
them make it again.

738
00:51:25,902 --> 00:51:28,146
We wait with bated breath.

739
00:51:29,491 --> 00:51:34,151
Sounds a bit grandiose to me,
dry ice in a place like this.

740
00:51:34,411 --> 00:51:38,908
I saw a rat when I was taking a leak.
You don't get that in Albert Hall.

741
00:51:39,166 --> 00:51:42,500
- Les hates "Scream Freedom. "
- I don't give a flying dog's bollock.

742
00:51:42,753 --> 00:51:46,206
I've been doing this for years.
He's been whistling up a ladder.

743
00:51:46,424 --> 00:51:50,089
It's full and noisy. Lots of
headbangers. Rough crowd.

744
00:51:50,344 --> 00:51:53,178
Maybe we should cut
the Joni Mitchell tribute.

745
00:51:53,471 --> 00:51:55,179
- Any sign of Astrid?
- Not yet.

746
00:52:03,732 --> 00:52:04,847
Fuck.

747
00:52:07,195 --> 00:52:10,776
Tokyo, 23,000 people.
Anaheim, 44,000 people.

748
00:52:11,031 --> 00:52:13,901
Dallas, 67,000 people!

749
00:52:14,158 --> 00:52:16,781
And you bring me headbangers!

750
00:53:23,772 --> 00:53:24,887
Oh, go home!

751
00:53:47,378 --> 00:53:49,122
Forget this, man.

752
00:53:49,798 --> 00:53:51,791
It's supposed to be rock 'n' roll!

753
00:53:52,050 --> 00:53:55,135
Not the Phantom
of the fucking Opera!

754
00:54:06,356 --> 00:54:09,524
I know what you're up to.
I've known it since day one.

755
00:54:09,776 --> 00:54:12,315
I can feel your eyes on me
every time I'm onstage.

756
00:54:12,571 --> 00:54:17,197
Why can't you just get your notes right
and remember the lyrics?

757
00:54:17,450 --> 00:54:19,942
I hate your fucking lyrics!

758
00:54:20,245 --> 00:54:23,696
They're not meaningful poetry
like Brian's, right?

759
00:54:24,624 --> 00:54:28,920
For him, the music was enough.
Before the hair and the limos.

760
00:54:29,172 --> 00:54:32,622
All I remember about Brian
is missed cues, missed gigs...

761
00:54:32,884 --> 00:54:34,792
...brother OD'd in a Little Chef.

762
00:54:35,052 --> 00:54:37,545
You worshiped the ground he vomited on.

763
00:54:37,806 --> 00:54:40,676
It's not because they're great.
It's because they're dead!

764
00:54:41,518 --> 00:54:44,221
Maybe if I was dead,
I'd get some respect.

765
00:54:44,436 --> 00:54:45,635
It would be a start.

766
00:54:52,486 --> 00:54:54,110
I'm not fifty.

767
00:54:54,906 --> 00:54:56,983
I'm not fifty!

768
00:55:03,872 --> 00:55:05,070
Back off!

769
00:55:05,624 --> 00:55:07,867
You got a problem, pick on me.

770
00:55:11,922 --> 00:55:12,953
Where's Ray?

771
00:55:13,215 --> 00:55:14,758
No one's seen him.

772
00:55:14,967 --> 00:55:16,545
He's doing one of his moodies.

773
00:55:16,802 --> 00:55:19,175
Don't go after him,
that's what he wants.

774
00:55:19,430 --> 00:55:23,177
- Hope this isn't another Sunderland.
- What happened in Sunderland?

775
00:55:23,433 --> 00:55:26,221
He tried to slash his wrists
with my Swiss Army knife.

776
00:55:26,437 --> 00:55:27,766
He couldn't find the blade.

777
00:55:28,023 --> 00:55:30,395
This could be serious.
He's on Prozac.

778
00:55:30,609 --> 00:55:33,894
Prozac and alfalfa sprouts?
That could be lethal.

779
00:55:37,992 --> 00:55:40,778
I love playing the guitar,
you know?

780
00:55:42,203 --> 00:55:44,659
Ain't much joy
for me here tonight.

781
00:55:45,082 --> 00:55:47,703
I think I'll retire to my boudoir...

782
00:55:47,917 --> 00:55:50,076
...if the youngsters
will keep the noise down.

783
00:55:50,337 --> 00:55:52,792
Hell, you sound like their father.

784
00:55:53,048 --> 00:55:55,621
Might be.
We toured here 20 years ago.

785
00:55:55,884 --> 00:55:57,960
And I know I had a shag then.

786
00:55:58,302 --> 00:56:00,129
Know what your problem is?

787
00:56:00,387 --> 00:56:03,058
You see yourself
as keeper of the flame.

788
00:56:03,267 --> 00:56:05,258
All these reasons
for your anger.

789
00:56:05,477 --> 00:56:07,469
Ray's style, Ray's taste,
Ray's lyrics.

790
00:56:07,937 --> 00:56:09,561
His shoes piss me off.

791
00:56:09,814 --> 00:56:12,269
You had your shot.
You couldn't hack it.

792
00:56:12,526 --> 00:56:14,317
Dearie me, trouble in paradise?

793
00:56:14,570 --> 00:56:16,361
Fuck off, Hughie!

794
00:56:16,697 --> 00:56:18,818
Why'd you come on this ride?

795
00:56:19,573 --> 00:56:22,659
Just to watch us
bollix it all up again?

796
00:56:23,494 --> 00:56:26,910
Maybe the antique trade's
slow this time of year.

797
00:56:27,123 --> 00:56:28,583
Blood, Sweat and Tears!

798
00:56:29,168 --> 00:56:29,997
What?

799
00:56:30,711 --> 00:56:32,372
Name of a band.
Parts of the body.

800
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:34,667
Triple whammy, right?

801
00:56:37,384 --> 00:56:39,091
The woman from the tax!

802
00:56:39,344 --> 00:56:41,836
I thought I saw her at the gig.

803
00:56:44,016 --> 00:56:46,637
- I want to go home. I'm sick of it.
- Not now.

804
00:56:46,851 --> 00:56:49,010
But this is stupid!

805
00:56:49,437 --> 00:56:50,553
Why don't we just pack it in?

806
00:56:50,815 --> 00:56:51,978
What's he saying?

807
00:56:52,191 --> 00:56:54,267
He wants the police
to impound your bus!

808
00:56:54,485 --> 00:56:58,316
Tell him we're well-established
on the British music scene...

809
00:56:58,571 --> 00:57:01,028
...and will live up
to their obligations.

810
00:57:01,659 --> 00:57:04,575
Why don't you live up to yours
and get us out of here?

811
00:57:07,872 --> 00:57:10,626
This isn't about me,
it's about him.

812
00:57:23,305 --> 00:57:26,223
Hey, Fruit. Want to get high?

813
00:57:30,188 --> 00:57:31,563
What you...

814
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:33,061
No, I...

815
00:57:36,318 --> 00:57:38,026
What you got?

816
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:41,655
You want to go up,
or you want to go down?

817
00:57:41,866 --> 00:57:43,657
Down. Definitely...

818
00:57:44,869 --> 00:57:46,113
...down.

819
00:57:52,627 --> 00:57:54,168
I heard you were here.

820
00:57:54,753 --> 00:57:55,951
You okay?

821
00:57:56,213 --> 00:57:58,206
No, not really, no.

822
00:57:59,425 --> 00:58:03,090
They want to hold the bus
till I get money wired for damages.

823
00:58:04,514 --> 00:58:06,638
What made me think I could do this?

824
00:58:06,892 --> 00:58:10,260
It's only you who's
held us together this long.

825
00:58:13,397 --> 00:58:16,933
You're going to need some help.
Financial.

826
00:58:17,901 --> 00:58:19,776
I want you to have this.

827
00:58:22,072 --> 00:58:25,857
No. This is your fallback,
your rainy day.

828
00:58:26,078 --> 00:58:27,452
It's yours now.

829
00:58:29,373 --> 00:58:31,115
Where's the tooth?

830
00:58:31,373 --> 00:58:33,947
Oh, shit. Oh, no! Where is it?

831
00:58:34,210 --> 00:58:36,084
- So tiny...
- Bollocks!

832
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:44,794
Hold on, man! Quick, quick!

833
00:58:46,974 --> 00:58:47,969
Stop!

834
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:54,434
Stop! You're about to violate
a piece of rock 'n' roll history!

835
00:59:04,909 --> 00:59:07,067
"They called him
the Prince of Darkness.

836
00:59:08,412 --> 00:59:11,827
And he ruled the Zuider Zee.

837
00:59:13,625 --> 00:59:15,333
And he had one mantra-"

838
00:59:20,549 --> 00:59:22,874
Bugger me.

839
00:59:27,847 --> 00:59:29,009
There we are.

840
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:34,681
Bollocks.

841
00:59:41,195 --> 00:59:42,690
Fuck. Oh, no.

842
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:49,070
Oh, no, no! Help, somebody!

843
00:59:50,036 --> 00:59:52,528
Jesus! Help! Somebody!

844
00:59:53,165 --> 00:59:54,446
Help!

845
00:59:55,334 --> 00:59:56,828
Oh, my God!

846
00:59:57,086 --> 00:59:59,411
Stay there! I'm coming!

847
01:00:19,233 --> 01:00:20,811
Oh, my God!

848
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:25,687
Somebody!

849
01:00:33,915 --> 01:00:35,325
Somebody...

850
01:00:36,751 --> 01:00:38,127
Oh, God!

851
01:00:55,811 --> 01:00:57,092
For God's sake, grab this!

852
01:00:58,857 --> 01:00:59,806
Pull!

853
01:01:04,945 --> 01:01:07,401
I think I had a near-death experience.

854
01:01:07,699 --> 01:01:10,451
It was almost a full-death experience.

855
01:01:10,701 --> 01:01:13,026
- I slipped.
- You're on a frozen canal.

856
01:01:13,287 --> 01:01:18,199
The tragedy for people like me is
our lives peak too early.

857
01:01:18,460 --> 01:01:19,373
Tragedy?

858
01:01:20,003 --> 01:01:24,213
Famine's a tragedy, Ray.
Or knocking down the rainforests.

859
01:01:24,465 --> 01:01:28,961
Anyway, some people's lives
never peak. Think about it.

860
01:01:29,387 --> 01:01:31,096
Happy birthday, by the way.

861
01:01:31,348 --> 01:01:32,427
I'm not fifty.

862
01:01:32,974 --> 01:01:34,516
Bollocks!

863
01:01:35,018 --> 01:01:37,937
Maybe it wasn't his tooth, anyway.

864
01:01:39,439 --> 01:01:43,389
That was the nicest thing
anyone's ever done for me.

865
01:01:44,027 --> 01:01:46,732
I'd do anything for you,
you know that?

866
01:01:47,656 --> 01:01:51,440
If you weren't so hung up on Brian,
I'd have married you years ago.

867
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:53,617
I told you once. Remember?
In Detroit.

868
01:01:53,870 --> 01:01:56,327
- No, it was Cardiff.
- Close.

869
01:01:56,582 --> 01:01:57,578
Brian-

870
01:01:59,917 --> 01:02:00,913
Tony.

871
01:02:04,714 --> 01:02:06,754
Let's get back to the hotel.

872
01:02:14,057 --> 01:02:16,845
Why are you still chasing ghosts?

873
01:02:24,902 --> 01:02:26,182
Can you move?

874
01:02:32,034 --> 01:02:35,238
I am at Amsterdam at 3:00!
There is no limo.

875
01:02:35,455 --> 01:02:38,123
I wait an hour.
I don't know who to call!

876
01:02:38,415 --> 01:02:40,621
I get train to this terrible place!

877
01:02:40,875 --> 01:02:44,744
The taxi driver's a fool!
He has not heard about the club.

878
01:02:45,005 --> 01:02:47,544
I have to tell you,
I'm bloody pissed off!

879
01:02:53,806 --> 01:02:55,431
Hello, baby.

880
01:02:55,683 --> 01:02:57,675
I'm okay now, thank you.

881
01:02:58,018 --> 01:02:59,299
Hello, baby.

882
01:03:00,103 --> 01:03:02,097
- What's happening?
- What happened to you?

883
01:03:02,314 --> 01:03:04,106
What have you taken?

884
01:03:04,358 --> 01:03:05,983
I love you, Momma.

885
01:03:08,529 --> 01:03:09,394
My God!

886
01:03:19,331 --> 01:03:20,160
What?

887
01:03:20,415 --> 01:03:23,998
Cockney Rebel! "Cock" and "knee, "
bonus points for that one.

888
01:03:24,253 --> 01:03:25,712
Who is this?

889
01:03:27,047 --> 01:03:28,589
Bastard!

890
01:03:29,633 --> 01:03:31,675
Sorry about that, darling.

891
01:03:39,185 --> 01:03:40,894
Who the fuck is this?

892
01:03:41,145 --> 01:03:42,973
Sorry, boss. I mean Karen.

893
01:03:43,231 --> 01:03:46,398
- Get your socks on. We're leaving.
- What? Now?!

894
01:03:57,119 --> 01:03:58,947
Come on, Tony-boy!

895
01:04:00,915 --> 01:04:02,030
Here we go!

896
01:04:04,168 --> 01:04:05,711
Easy, now!

897
01:04:09,091 --> 01:04:10,122
Here we go!

898
01:04:25,482 --> 01:04:28,103
Was this your tooth, Tony?

899
01:04:30,278 --> 01:04:32,153
Hilarious, Beano.

900
01:04:33,489 --> 01:04:35,529
Fucking hilarious.

901
01:04:44,335 --> 01:04:45,414
Hello, man.

902
01:04:47,047 --> 01:04:48,374
About last night...

903
01:04:49,215 --> 01:04:50,840
It's a heavy thought that...

904
01:04:51,175 --> 01:04:53,213
...I drove you to do
something that desperate.

905
01:04:54,094 --> 01:04:54,923
What?

906
01:04:57,014 --> 01:04:59,090
Well, you know, man.

907
01:04:59,475 --> 01:05:02,345
A dark night of the soul, I suppose.

908
01:05:02,686 --> 01:05:04,228
Yeah, well.

909
01:05:05,523 --> 01:05:08,440
There's maybe some things
I shouldn't have said.

910
01:05:09,193 --> 01:05:11,101
Shouldn't have said them
20 years ago.

911
01:05:11,361 --> 01:05:13,152
He says he's a very bastard pig.

912
01:05:15,199 --> 01:05:18,650
Does Les think
Ray was trying to kill himself?

913
01:05:19,328 --> 01:05:22,743
I may have given him
that impression, yes.

914
01:05:23,665 --> 01:05:26,453
Best for the band, I thought.

915
01:05:31,088 --> 01:05:32,500
You should know this.

916
01:05:33,133 --> 01:05:34,794
Last night...

917
01:05:35,136 --> 01:05:37,674
...as the icy waters closed over me...

918
01:05:39,098 --> 01:05:40,675
...I saw Brian.

919
01:05:45,189 --> 01:05:47,227
What was he wearing?

920
01:05:47,607 --> 01:05:49,266
I don't remember.

921
01:05:49,525 --> 01:05:51,731
But I saw him so clearly.

922
01:05:52,569 --> 01:05:56,022
Maybe he was on some
astral travel trip.

923
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:00,024
I don't know,
but he was sending a message.

924
01:06:00,786 --> 01:06:03,741
And the message was positive, man.

925
01:06:27,771 --> 01:06:31,853
Better call the club.
Tell them we might not make it.

926
01:06:32,069 --> 01:06:34,737
The fates have conspired against us.

927
01:06:34,946 --> 01:06:37,069
It was that
old Scottish phrase again:

928
01:06:37,282 --> 01:06:40,699
- "If you don't succeed... "
- "... pull your foreskin over your head. "

929
01:06:40,953 --> 01:06:43,241
Is that how you all feel?
Is it?

930
01:06:43,497 --> 01:06:45,488
If it is,
we can all piss off home...

931
01:06:45,832 --> 01:06:48,120
...and get on
with the rest of our lives.

932
01:06:49,543 --> 01:06:51,122
Excuse me.

933
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:53,871
You go, maybe, to Antwerp?

934
01:06:55,091 --> 01:06:57,629
Hasn't been decided yet, my lovely.

935
01:07:01,932 --> 01:07:03,890
Where did you get that T-shirt?

936
01:07:04,142 --> 01:07:06,846
This? It belonged my father.

937
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:08,301
Look at that.

938
01:07:11,691 --> 01:07:13,684
Must've been through the wash
a few times.

939
01:07:13,985 --> 01:07:15,444
My father, he died.

940
01:07:15,737 --> 01:07:17,859
- Sorry.
- That's a shitter.

941
01:07:18,114 --> 01:07:19,941
They were his favorite band.

942
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:23,367
He say, best band he ever saw.

943
01:07:23,911 --> 01:07:25,654
It's another sign.

944
01:07:27,123 --> 01:07:28,404
Brian sent her.

945
01:07:29,417 --> 01:07:30,995
Thank you, Brian.

946
01:08:54,129 --> 01:08:55,373
Band sounds good.

947
01:08:56,048 --> 01:08:57,127
Wicked!

948
01:09:57,400 --> 01:09:58,810
Excuse me!

949
01:10:04,115 --> 01:10:06,986
Get lost, you slut!
He's mine!

950
01:10:55,208 --> 01:10:56,488
I love you!

951
01:11:05,552 --> 01:11:09,385
A week later, a record deal.
Straight into the studio.

952
01:11:09,641 --> 01:11:11,929
And Ray let Les sing!

953
01:11:12,183 --> 01:11:14,721
Just one song,
but on the scale of miracles...

954
01:11:14,978 --> 01:11:18,348
...this rated at a level
with the Immaculate Conception.

955
01:11:57,689 --> 01:11:59,681
Zoë Ball's program's on.

956
01:11:59,899 --> 01:12:01,524
In a minute.
There's money on this.

957
01:12:01,776 --> 01:12:06,190
I also caught up with
seminal 70s rockers, Strange Fruit.

958
01:12:06,448 --> 01:12:08,488
Why play
such down-and-out venues?

959
01:12:08,951 --> 01:12:11,156
This tour, we wanted to be...

960
01:12:11,410 --> 01:12:16,203
...more grassroots, you know,
with the audience right in your face.

961
01:12:16,791 --> 01:12:18,748
As a band, do you miss Brian?

962
01:12:18,959 --> 01:12:21,285
If you want my opinion...

963
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:24,163
...Brian Lovell
was as near to a genius...

964
01:12:24,424 --> 01:12:26,631
...as you can get in this business.

965
01:12:26,885 --> 01:12:27,999
Don't remember this.

966
01:12:28,261 --> 01:12:30,087
You'd left.
She got them tanked up.

967
01:12:30,303 --> 01:12:32,343
People who remember the Fruits...

968
01:12:32,598 --> 01:12:35,007
...remember Keith and Brian.

969
01:12:35,853 --> 01:12:39,517
They don't remember Wicksey,
Ray, or me.

970
01:12:39,773 --> 01:12:44,186
Except maybe when I fell off
the stage once, pissed as a bollock.

971
01:12:44,445 --> 01:12:48,905
No use kidding yourself we're
Strange Fruit, because we ain't.

972
01:12:49,156 --> 01:12:51,778
Not with Brian and Keith ten feet under.

973
01:12:52,119 --> 01:12:53,992
You dickhead, Beano!

974
01:12:54,246 --> 01:12:58,706
Maybe if we was to call ourselves
"Slightly Strange Fruit. "

975
01:12:58,958 --> 01:13:01,712
Or how about
"Fairly Ordinary Fruit"?

976
01:13:01,962 --> 01:13:05,082
Or "Canned Fruit. " I'm canned.

977
01:13:05,340 --> 01:13:07,048
Don't know about you.

978
01:13:09,844 --> 01:13:11,125
Ray, come here!

979
01:13:12,514 --> 01:13:14,756
- You fucking assholes!
- Hey!

980
01:13:14,975 --> 01:13:17,051
This is set point!

981
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:21,095
- What's rattled your eyeliner?
- You two crapped all over this band!

982
01:13:23,734 --> 01:13:25,560
- That's enough!
- Get off me!

983
01:13:28,154 --> 01:13:29,529
I'm sorry.

984
01:13:29,781 --> 01:13:31,156
I didn't mean... I'm sorry.

985
01:13:36,748 --> 01:13:38,241
Leave it!

986
01:13:41,128 --> 01:13:44,910
You'll be hitting each other
with your handbags next.

987
01:13:45,172 --> 01:13:48,256
You never forgave me
for taking over from Keith!

988
01:13:49,969 --> 01:13:51,167
Well...

989
01:13:51,805 --> 01:13:55,008
...you can find yourself
another fucking singer.

990
01:14:02,857 --> 01:14:04,398
For chrissake!

991
01:14:05,609 --> 01:14:07,068
This was about us.

992
01:14:07,318 --> 01:14:09,193
This was our second shot.

993
01:14:10,114 --> 01:14:13,150
And it was working.
Anybody who was at Antwerp saw it.

994
01:14:13,409 --> 01:14:18,486
We were brilliant, better than
we ever were. We were a great band!

995
01:14:18,915 --> 01:14:20,788
Stupid bastards!
Why couldn't you...

996
01:14:21,042 --> 01:14:23,413
...bury the past before it buried us?

997
01:15:13,720 --> 01:15:14,835
Ironically...

998
01:15:15,097 --> 01:15:19,225
...a week later was the 25th
anniversary of Keith's death.

999
01:15:19,434 --> 01:15:22,184
Because she didn't
have a grave for Brian...

1000
01:15:22,436 --> 01:15:24,560
...Karen went to pay her respects.

1001
01:15:25,065 --> 01:15:27,104
God, look at them all!

1002
01:15:28,818 --> 01:15:31,356
This one's written in Dutch.
Look!

1003
01:15:37,662 --> 01:15:40,578
"Even after all this time,
the flame still burns.

1004
01:15:40,830 --> 01:15:43,237
Love you, man. Brian. "

1005
01:15:49,256 --> 01:15:50,999
Where is he, Hughie?

1006
01:15:51,675 --> 01:15:53,467
He's alive, isn't he?

1007
01:15:55,763 --> 01:15:58,514
We went to the cemetery.
He sent flowers.

1008
01:15:58,723 --> 01:16:01,179
Probably a fan
with a twisted sense of humor.

1009
01:16:01,392 --> 01:16:04,809
Or you, looking after him
like you always did.

1010
01:16:05,439 --> 01:16:08,808
I thought he was dead!
Why did you put me through that?

1011
01:16:09,443 --> 01:16:12,065
- I love the wee guy.
- You're not the only one.

1012
01:16:12,279 --> 01:16:16,194
When he came back from the States,
he was a basket case.

1013
01:16:16,409 --> 01:16:20,405
I couldn't let him go through
all that shit again.

1014
01:16:20,662 --> 01:16:23,284
Maybe it wouldn't have been
all that shit again.

1015
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:28,167
But wasn't it? There's no blinding
flash on the road to Damascus.

1016
01:16:28,378 --> 01:16:31,879
Listen, Hughie.
The guys don't deserve this.

1017
01:16:32,091 --> 01:16:33,834
You saw how close they were.

1018
01:16:34,343 --> 01:16:37,047
- You were there.
- Did you tell him?

1019
01:16:37,429 --> 01:16:38,592
How good they were?

1020
01:16:39,848 --> 01:16:41,842
As a matter of fact, I did.

1021
01:16:42,102 --> 01:16:44,639
I even let him hear a couple of tracks.

1022
01:16:47,940 --> 01:16:50,610
- You'll find him just over there.
- Thanks.

1023
01:16:58,658 --> 01:17:01,067
Maybe you should talk to him first.

1024
01:17:45,123 --> 01:17:48,410
I was trying to picture
what you would look like.

1025
01:17:51,380 --> 01:17:53,003
Still look like yourself.

1026
01:17:54,465 --> 01:17:56,043
You don't look much different.

1027
01:17:57,385 --> 01:17:58,500
A few more lines.

1028
01:17:59,512 --> 01:18:01,304
Less than you deserve.

1029
01:18:04,433 --> 01:18:06,344
How long have you been working here?

1030
01:18:06,603 --> 01:18:08,477
Since I stopped being a patient.

1031
01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:12,358
Kind of handy if I have a relapse.

1032
01:18:14,109 --> 01:18:15,854
But you're fine now, yeah?

1033
01:18:16,363 --> 01:18:18,485
Tchaikovsky, when conducting...

1034
01:18:18,740 --> 01:18:21,860
...used to cradle a hand on his head.

1035
01:18:22,118 --> 01:18:24,574
He thought it might fall off.

1036
01:18:25,414 --> 01:18:28,249
- Did you know that?
- No, I didn't.

1037
01:18:28,708 --> 01:18:30,083
Is that how you felt?

1038
01:18:31,752 --> 01:18:33,994
Is that why
you gave your royalties away?

1039
01:18:34,798 --> 01:18:35,913
No.

1040
01:18:38,469 --> 01:18:41,469
The only way I could get away
from the life I had...

1041
01:18:41,764 --> 01:18:44,052
...was to start again with a new one.

1042
01:18:47,895 --> 01:18:49,472
Do you like my garden?

1043
01:18:50,480 --> 01:18:51,476
It's beautiful.

1044
01:18:51,731 --> 01:18:53,012
I write songs here.

1045
01:18:53,483 --> 01:18:54,397
Yeah!

1046
01:18:54,652 --> 01:18:59,360
I've got over a hundred of them
in a Sainsbury's plastic bag.

1047
01:19:05,580 --> 01:19:08,699
Did you play the Fruits' tracks?

1048
01:19:10,333 --> 01:19:15,328
Too much reverb for my taste,
but they were definitely happening.

1049
01:19:16,298 --> 01:19:17,673
They missed you.

1050
01:19:18,509 --> 01:19:20,133
I miss them.

1051
01:19:25,600 --> 01:19:28,884
Anything in the rules
says I can't give you a hug?

1052
01:19:30,019 --> 01:19:31,812
I don't think so.

1053
01:20:01,178 --> 01:20:04,713
Why did you leave me
all those years ago?

1054
01:20:10,353 --> 01:20:12,511
I didn't want to watch you die.

1055
01:20:40,175 --> 01:20:41,884
The house has much history.

1056
01:20:42,136 --> 01:20:45,503
Queen Victoria slept here,
and so did Steve Winwood.

1057
01:20:50,811 --> 01:20:52,222
You cannot see Ray.

1058
01:20:52,479 --> 01:20:55,645
He don't want to see you
bloody people again.

1059
01:20:55,858 --> 01:20:56,972
That's nice.

1060
01:20:58,194 --> 01:20:59,937
He'll see me.

1061
01:21:02,238 --> 01:21:03,732
Brian, careful!

1062
01:21:44,365 --> 01:21:47,531
I can see you, Brian.
So clearly.

1063
01:21:48,494 --> 01:21:50,451
Do you have a message?

1064
01:21:51,622 --> 01:21:53,579
Got a gig on Saturday, man.

1065
01:21:56,044 --> 01:21:57,241
What?

1066
01:21:57,504 --> 01:22:02,460
A record number of people, maybe
200,000. Wisbech is happening!

1067
01:22:06,137 --> 01:22:07,465
Great to see you.

1068
01:22:07,722 --> 01:22:09,465
This is a great thrill for me.

1069
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:10,755
Brian Lovell?

1070
01:22:11,016 --> 01:22:14,516
I'm pleased the rumors
of your demise were premature.

1071
01:22:14,729 --> 01:22:17,481
I hope we're on
after Mott the Hoople this time.

1072
01:22:17,690 --> 01:22:20,643
- After Mott and Little Feat.
- Little Feet, one point.

1073
01:22:23,154 --> 01:22:24,316
Questions, please.

1074
01:22:24,571 --> 01:22:26,114
So which Fruit's which?

1075
01:22:26,782 --> 01:22:29,355
I'm Posh Fruit.
Les is Sour Fruit.

1076
01:22:29,619 --> 01:22:32,654
Ray's the one with money.
He's Bread Fruit.

1077
01:22:32,914 --> 01:22:35,583
What does that make you, Brian?
Bruised fruit?

1078
01:22:35,916 --> 01:22:37,956
Brian, 20 years ago you said...

1079
01:22:38,210 --> 01:22:41,330
..."I'll never walk on stage
with the Fruits again. "

1080
01:22:41,589 --> 01:22:42,669
How do you feel about that now?

1081
01:22:44,050 --> 01:22:46,837
Since when did anyone
believe what they read?

1082
01:22:47,095 --> 01:22:51,389
Any new material on the tour,
or just golden oldies?

1083
01:22:53,768 --> 01:22:55,596
Any punch-ups on the tour?

1084
01:22:55,854 --> 01:22:58,973
- It was sweetness and light.
- Very mellow vibe.

1085
01:23:10,118 --> 01:23:11,494
Oh, fuck!

1086
01:23:11,787 --> 01:23:16,115
Did you plant the story of
Brian's death as a publicity stunt?

1087
01:23:16,331 --> 01:23:17,162
Of course not.

1088
01:23:17,416 --> 01:23:21,284
There are questions about your life.
Wasn't the pressure too much?

1089
01:23:21,546 --> 01:23:23,539
Was that when you lost your plot?

1090
01:23:23,798 --> 01:23:26,799
- Were you in a mental home?
- Or in a clinic?

1091
01:23:27,051 --> 01:23:30,966
- You used to be a patient-
- One question at a time, please.

1092
01:23:31,181 --> 01:23:36,304
Was the breakdown chemically induced,
or brought about by Keith's death?

1093
01:23:41,191 --> 01:23:42,353
Can you answer?

1094
01:23:42,568 --> 01:23:43,599
Let's go. Come on.

1095
01:23:43,944 --> 01:23:48,072
- You called a press conference!
- You've got a responsibility to answer.

1096
01:23:48,324 --> 01:23:50,032
Are you going to answer?

1097
01:23:50,284 --> 01:23:51,944
We need pictures, guys!

1098
01:23:52,161 --> 01:23:53,489
You people are really something!

1099
01:23:53,704 --> 01:23:58,164
All you want is a few free drinks
and a chance to tear people down.

1100
01:23:58,458 --> 01:24:00,784
Those guys deserve
a bit more respect.

1101
01:24:03,046 --> 01:24:05,418
You bunch of wankers!

1102
01:24:12,431 --> 01:24:15,596
Find Beano, love.
I want everyone to hear this.

1103
01:24:15,809 --> 01:24:17,183
Hear what?

1104
01:24:18,729 --> 01:24:20,520
Brian's not going on.

1105
01:24:22,524 --> 01:24:24,433
We knew it might happen.

1106
01:24:24,693 --> 01:24:26,685
With or without him, you'll be okay.

1107
01:24:26,946 --> 01:24:31,157
He just feels he could do
without all that flack again, you know.

1108
01:24:38,583 --> 01:24:40,042
Mr. Baggot!

1109
01:24:43,546 --> 01:24:45,088
Who are you?

1110
01:24:49,677 --> 01:24:51,550
You were in the first band I ever saw.

1111
01:24:51,845 --> 01:24:55,095
My father banned me from
seeing a rock concert again.

1112
01:24:55,307 --> 01:24:56,137
He was a Methodist.

1113
01:24:57,936 --> 01:25:01,470
- So what do you want from me?
- Quick, violent sex.

1114
01:25:10,281 --> 01:25:13,067
You're not from
the Inland Revenue, then?

1115
01:25:19,081 --> 01:25:21,488
What can I tell you?
I'm minus a drummer.

1116
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:26,045
Don't pull this stroke on me.
You're not going on after Quo.

1117
01:25:26,297 --> 01:25:28,089
If you don't go on now,
they'll get ugly.

1118
01:25:28,341 --> 01:25:30,214
Listen, they're baying for our blood.

1119
01:25:30,467 --> 01:25:34,548
Let's find another drummer.
There's got to be a dozen here.

1120
01:25:34,763 --> 01:25:38,263
- Thank you very much for the loyalty.
- Where have you been?

1121
01:25:38,475 --> 01:25:43,388
- It doesn't matter. Are you okay?
- I'm very okay, as a matter of fact.

1122
01:25:43,649 --> 01:25:45,227
Shall we do this then?

1123
01:25:45,484 --> 01:25:48,733
All right, let's go.
Come on! Let's go, Fruits!

1124
01:25:49,070 --> 01:25:51,477
Okay, everyone, it's been far too long.

1125
01:25:51,739 --> 01:25:56,153
So let me hear you give a great welcome
to Strange Fruit!

1126
01:27:03,938 --> 01:27:05,182
Come on!

1127
01:27:40,767 --> 01:27:41,681
Go on!

1128
01:27:44,728 --> 01:27:46,520
"The Flame Still Burns. "

1129
01:27:58,952 --> 01:28:00,197
What key are we in?

1130
01:28:00,453 --> 01:28:01,781
E. B.

1131
01:30:33,857 --> 01:30:35,481
Don't you dare.

1132
01:30:45,244 --> 01:30:46,738
I was wrong about God.

1133
01:30:46,954 --> 01:30:49,743
Turns out He likes
that 70s stuff after all.

1134
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,664
So it didn't piss down,
and they played four encores.

1135
01:30:53,919 --> 01:30:57,918
And with the Almighty in their corner,
who knows what might happen?

1136
01:30:58,174 --> 01:31:02,753
And how will the Fruits conspire
to bollix things up this time around?

1137
01:31:03,012 --> 01:31:05,716
We wait with bated breath.

1138
01:35:24,193 --> 01:35:28,321
I've got one. Tom Petty
and the Heartbreakers.

1139
01:35:28,530 --> 01:35:32,907
Here, I had one with "heart. "
Gerry and the Pacemakers.
