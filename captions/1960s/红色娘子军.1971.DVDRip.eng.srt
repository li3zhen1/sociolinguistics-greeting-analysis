00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:17,581
This is a war story about heroines.

3
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:21,925
It took place on Hainan Island

4
00:00:21,926 --> 00:00:25,318
in south China, in 1930.

5
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:30,062
It was a period when the Chinese people greatly suffered.

6
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:35,961
It was also a period when the young Red Army laid its foundation in China.

26
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,431
Hey, who is this?

27
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:58,876
Hey, this must be the hatchet man of the local tyrant Nan Batian.

28
00:02:58,978 --> 00:03:03,381
Well, the Coconut Grove is ahead. Watch out.

29
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:11,953
Stinking lackey, where are you running to?

30
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,624
I feel so suffocated to see the enemy tyrannize us.

31
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:22,394
If we were on the battlefield, I would beat them.

32
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,902
Don't mess things up, little devil. We will eradicate the enemies one day.

33
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:31,107
Crossing this barrier, we'll be at the Soviet District.

34
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:39,644
Stop! Where are you from?

35
00:03:39,786 --> 00:03:41,185
Guangzhou.

36
00:03:42,322 --> 00:03:44,449
What do you do?

37
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:49,688
Stop shouting. We are overseas Chinese from Southeast Asia.

38
00:03:58,004 --> 00:03:58,766
Open it up.

39
00:03:59,672 --> 00:04:01,299
Let them examine it.

40
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:37,232
Take it away.

41
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:54,258
You still want to run away, you son of a bitch, stinking lackey?

42
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:58,356
I'm running away because I can't bear it!

43
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,067
Go!

44
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:13,677
Go quickly!

45
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:23,353
Go!

46
00:05:30,963 --> 00:05:31,759
Go over there!

47
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,305
Fourth Master.

48
00:05:43,409 --> 00:05:44,671
Who are they?

49
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:45,607
They are overseas Chinese.

50
00:05:46,646 --> 00:05:47,704
They have lots of money.

51
00:05:48,815 --> 00:05:52,342
Your local militias are simply brigands.

52
00:05:56,756 --> 00:05:59,350
Go get your commander-in-chief.

53
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,528
You are simply blind.

54
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:25,016
He is a high-ranking overseas Chinese who can create miracles.

55
00:06:26,085 --> 00:06:30,954
He has made a pile abroad and came back to build ancestral halls.

56
00:06:33,526 --> 00:06:36,495
As you can see, the president of Guangdong province,

57
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:40,623
and chief of security and directors of every department are on the list,

58
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,998
let alone the rich and powerful families of Hainan.

59
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:46,937
Old Four, what's the matter with you guys?

60
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,735
Thinking him a wealthy man, they caught him.

61
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:54,475
Bring him here and let me talk to him face to face.

62
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:56,939
Old Four.

63
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:02,077
No, bring my coat.

64
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,695
Comrade Changqing.

65
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:15,996
She suffered a lot from the beating.

66
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,104
She said she tried to run away several times.

67
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:21,470
Why did she want to run away?

68
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,097
I didn't understand clearly.

69
00:07:24,243 --> 00:07:28,646
She said she wanted to become a female soldier so as to take revenge.

70
00:07:28,748 --> 00:07:34,709
The trend of forming a women army has swept through here.

71
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:51,094
Here comes the master.

72
00:08:09,121 --> 00:08:11,112
How can you treat Mr. Hong like this?

73
00:08:12,492 --> 00:08:18,488
The servant knows nothing. I'm sorry for the offence. Please.

74
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:28,702
Here are Master's things. Please check them out.

75
00:08:30,109 --> 00:08:31,133
No need for that.

76
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,582
Let's take away the donated money and return home tonight.

77
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:46,615
Leaving tonight will leave us open to suspicion.

78
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:51,486
Hold still. If he dares to importune us,

79
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,464
we will never let him be at ease.

80
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:58,294
Take advantage to get his friend's number.

81
00:08:59,205 --> 00:09:01,537
It can help us leave here in the future.

82
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,406
Entertain him fairly.

83
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,910
We must captivate this big fish,

84
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:11,552
and use his connection network to buy

85
00:09:11,553 --> 00:09:15,483
ammunition in Guangzhou and Southeast Asia.

86
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:25,930
Look at this fellow.

87
00:09:26,032 --> 00:09:30,401
There may be no difficulty to ask him for 500 guns.

88
00:09:31,437 --> 00:09:35,840
Though the world belongs to the Chiang family now,

89
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:40,309
Hainan Island is still too far away for the Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek,

90
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:43,212
to control for the moment.

91
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:50,419
I mean this is a chance of a lifetime.

92
00:09:50,523 --> 00:09:52,013
You're right.

93
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:53,819
Here comes Master Huang.

94
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:02,396
Master.

95
00:10:02,501 --> 00:10:05,902
Come here.

96
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:10,136
This is a great hero, Lu Li, who rarely appears in public.

97
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:12,404
Huang Zhanshan, it's my pleasure to meet you.

98
00:10:12,545 --> 00:10:13,534
It is a great pleasure to meet you.

99
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:16,945
This is my steward and brainpower.

100
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,678
Master, the meal is ready.

101
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:24,688
To help Mr. Hong recover from the shock, serve the meal.

102
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:25,688
Yes.

103
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:28,216
Serve the meal.

104
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:30,659
Please, please.

105
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:33,996
Put out the light.

106
00:10:39,905 --> 00:10:42,669
This is my servant's humble idea for entertainment.

107
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:53,991
Two Dragons Playing With The Pearl.

108
00:10:53,992 --> 00:10:57,953
These are family dishes.

109
00:10:58,758 --> 00:11:01,315
Mr. Hong, please drink this cup of snake bile wine.

110
00:11:01,316 --> 00:11:02,888
Double Bile For Honorable Guests.

111
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:05,058
Thank you.

112
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,967
Come on. Come on. To a wealthy life, please.

113
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,559
Please, please.

114
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:58,074
Mr. Hong, why didn't you bring Baorun?

115
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:05,821
It is not peaceful on the road. It is inconvenient to bring women.

116
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:13,256
To tell you a joke, some mistakes happened when I passed by your village.

117
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:17,495
But for the help of hospitable Brother Nan, would I...?

118
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:20,967
Come on. Help yourself.

119
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,631
Please.

120
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,410
You are selling people at night again.

121
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:38,480
We can go to the brothel after selling her.

122
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,032
Come up.

123
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,130
I have found you a husband.

124
00:13:00,045 --> 00:13:01,137
Come up, you...

125
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:23,401
Catch her. Qionghua intends to run away.

126
00:13:25,337 --> 00:13:29,831
Catch her. Don't let go.

127
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:38,009
Currently, there are only a few central armies on the island.

128
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:39,902
The commander-in-chief Mr. Jiang is busy

129
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:42,011
encircling and annihilating the Communist Party on the mainland.

130
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:45,885
These are mostly armed forces of the local militia from the counties.

131
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,885
It is like Chinese opera.

132
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:55,228
All the lords divide the territory and one dominates an area.

133
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:58,734
Yes, yes. However, we only have one enemy.

134
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,102
That is the Communist Party on Hainan Island.

135
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:06,068
Its so-called Red Army was formed hastily this summer.

136
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:11,743
Only one regiment has arms.

137
00:14:11,884 --> 00:14:14,853
The others are pieced together.

138
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:24,085
But, the Communist Party is our serious trouble.

139
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:30,391
We must eradicate it before it gets strong.

140
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:34,630
Brother Hong.

141
00:14:35,307 --> 00:14:37,683
If you want to accomplish something at home,

142
00:14:37,684 --> 00:14:40,006
you must annihilate the Communist Party first.

143
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:46,651
If you and I unite, we can conquer Hainan.

144
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:52,856
I ought to devote myself to this wonderful plan.

145
00:14:54,093 --> 00:14:59,258
However, I have to do my filial duty and build the ancestral hall first.

146
00:14:59,365 --> 00:15:02,493
Oh, yes. Filial piety is a fundamental duty.

147
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,906
Qionghua ran again just now.

148
00:15:12,011 --> 00:15:14,878
This slave girl has run away many times.

149
00:15:23,022 --> 00:15:25,582
I want to ask you a favor.

150
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:26,783
Tell me. Tell me.

151
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:32,897
My mother and the commander-in-chief Mr. Nan are from the same town.

152
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:37,944
My mother is staying in Zhuangzhou.

153
00:15:37,945 --> 00:15:41,195
She wants to buy a slave girl who can speak our native language.

154
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,241
Could you please do me a favor?

155
00:15:43,876 --> 00:15:47,175
It's nothing. I can handle it for you.

156
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:50,313
Since the slave girl is for your mother,

157
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:55,012
we need to pick one with good character and appearance.

158
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,445
You see?

159
00:15:57,556 --> 00:16:02,016
Master, in my opinion, you can give up what you favor.

160
00:16:02,127 --> 00:16:05,153
I dare not snatch your favorite.

161
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:09,999
How about the girl dragged inside just now?

162
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:13,903
It's nothing. She violated some family rules.

163
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:17,133
Oh, the girl looks terrific,

164
00:16:17,276 --> 00:16:19,767
but she's a little rude.

165
00:16:21,013 --> 00:16:24,847
She's just a slave girl. Having a loose manner is inevitable.

166
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:29,114
She is so lucky that Brother Hong likes her.

167
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:35,624
Go pack for her and ask her to go with Mr. Hong tomorrow.

168
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:46,882
Fine. I will wait for you.

169
00:16:46,883 --> 00:16:50,233
We will talk in detail after you have shown filial piety to your family.

170
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:51,042
OK. OK.

171
00:16:51,043 --> 00:16:51,907
Please get on the horse.

172
00:16:56,382 --> 00:16:58,350
OK. Let's meet again some day.

173
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,280
Have a nice journey.

174
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:15,260
Madam, please have mercy on me.

175
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,858
Madam, please have mercy on me.

176
00:17:48,133 --> 00:17:50,397
Comrade Changqing, shall we take her back to our division?

177
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:52,333
No, our division station shouldn't be exposed.

178
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:54,498
Doesn't she want to join the women's army?

179
00:17:54,606 --> 00:17:56,437
Show her the way to our Stone Village.

180
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,406
She can go along the branch road ahead.

181
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,238
OK.

182
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,203
What are you doing?

183
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,468
Young lady, please turn around.

184
00:18:40,752 --> 00:18:42,879
What do you want, Master?

185
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:46,081
He is not a master at all.

186
00:18:48,260 --> 00:18:49,625
You are free now.

187
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,799
That means you can go anywhere you want.

188
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,608
Really.

189
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:05,107
Absolutely.

190
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:12,107
Hey, wait a moment.

191
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,350
What?

192
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,722
I wonder where you are going.

193
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,153
It's none of your business.

194
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:23,791
I don't mean to interfere your life.

195
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:27,023
I just wonder if you have a place.

196
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:28,861
I'm afraid you are alone.

197
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:32,531
Where's your home?

198
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,730
Home...

199
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,854
I have no home.

200
00:19:49,955 --> 00:19:53,118
What? You have no home?

201
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:56,255
Three years ago,

202
00:19:56,328 --> 00:20:01,391
the commander-in-chief Nan Batian killed my father.

203
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:05,862
My mother was beaten until crippled and driven away.

204
00:20:05,863 --> 00:20:08,131
She probably starved to death.

205
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,778
Why did I mention this to you?

206
00:20:14,646 --> 00:20:17,080
Would you like to join the women's army?

207
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:25,182
I'd love to.

208
00:20:26,091 --> 00:20:27,149
All right.

209
00:20:27,292 --> 00:20:29,021
Tell you,

210
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:33,600
now you go along this road and turn left.

211
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:36,026
You'll see Red Stone Village.

212
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,913
If they are forming a women army, they must be there.

213
00:20:38,914 --> 00:20:40,164
Do you know how to get there?

214
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:41,738
I can find it.

215
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:44,898
What's your name?

216
00:20:46,645 --> 00:20:48,203
Wu Qionghua.

217
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,521
All right, Qionghua.

218
00:20:52,522 --> 00:20:58,088
This is for you to buy something to eat on the way.

219
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:01,426
Take it.

220
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:31,850
Let's go.

221
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:40,621
Secretary Hong, Xiao Pang, you are back.

222
00:21:40,766 --> 00:21:42,358
Yes, we're back.

223
00:21:44,269 --> 00:21:45,463
Secretary Hong.

224
00:21:45,604 --> 00:21:46,901
Xiao Niu, where's the division commander?

225
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:47,739
Over there.

226
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:49,768
Division commander!

227
00:21:49,941 --> 00:21:50,873
You are back!

228
00:21:50,942 --> 00:21:52,171
-Division commander.
-You finally got back!

229
00:21:52,277 --> 00:21:55,209
-We are back.
-Look at you. Interesting.

230
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:56,803
We have brought back all the money.

231
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:58,072
-Little devil.
-Division commander.

232
00:21:58,216 --> 00:21:59,016
Give it to me.

233
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:00,273
Let's go.

234
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:01,477
How's it going?

235
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,589
Xiao Wang, prepare the meal quickly.

236
00:22:10,762 --> 00:22:12,059
How can you make it so fast?

237
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:13,862
How could I delay?

238
00:22:16,601 --> 00:22:18,364
Come on. Drink some water.

239
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,203
Fine.

240
00:22:20,238 --> 00:22:23,435
With these amulets and the help of the underground party,

241
00:22:23,575 --> 00:22:25,941
we went through the White Zone in disguise.

242
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:28,612
Division commander.

243
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:32,547
The workers in Guangzhou, Haikou and Ao'men were so zealous.

244
00:22:33,385 --> 00:22:35,876
They said, though their donations were limited,

245
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,921
they belonged to the working class.

246
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,218
It was to show that they support the Red Army.

247
00:22:41,159 --> 00:22:46,654
They were so enthusiastic, hearing we are preparing for the revolution.

248
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,831
Go get your commander-in-chief Mr. Nan here.

249
00:22:50,969 --> 00:22:52,493
Comrade Changqing.

250
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:54,868
We must stay calm and hold still.

251
00:22:54,973 --> 00:22:57,464
When the old fellow Nan Batian comes here

252
00:22:57,609 --> 00:23:00,237
we should serve him cigarettes and wine to show our respect.

253
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:04,213
We will go to Red Stone Village together after eating.

254
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:08,184
They are ready for the opening ceremony tomorrow morning.

255
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:12,155
This is the first revolutionary armed force of the Red Army.

256
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:15,486
I had thought you, as the party representative of the women's army,

257
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:17,687
couldn't show up at the ceremony.

258
00:23:19,431 --> 00:23:24,266
Early tomorrow morning, Qiong Hua...

259
00:23:24,369 --> 00:23:25,802
I can make it.

260
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,407
Don't drink that.

261
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,551
Come in my house. There is water here.

262
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:53,385
Come on.

263
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:02,529
Don't shut the door.

264
00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:03,367
What for?

265
00:25:04,402 --> 00:25:06,097
Oh, don't be afraid.

266
00:25:14,813 --> 00:25:18,078
Here is the money. I got four coins.

267
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:25,152
I'm also female.

268
00:25:34,165 --> 00:25:38,568
Sit down. Still hungry? Here you are.

269
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:59,422
Why are you so hungry?

270
00:26:00,425 --> 00:26:01,983
I escaped from prison.

271
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:04,186
I haven't had anything for three or four days.

272
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:06,161
You escaped?

273
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:10,726
A benefactor rescued me.

274
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,038
I met many nice people today.

275
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:16,407
There are few good people this time of year.

276
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,648
You must be very careful because you are alone.

277
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:24,801
I'm nearly there.

278
00:26:24,802 --> 00:26:27,775
Is Red Stone Village on the side of the mountain?

279
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:29,820
You are going to the Soviet District?

280
00:26:29,988 --> 00:26:33,424
Yes, there's no other way.

281
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,594
But why do you dress up like a man?

282
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:41,631
I'm also going to the Soviet District.

283
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:45,464
That's great. We're going the same way.

284
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:49,902
Why are you home alone?

285
00:26:50,041 --> 00:26:52,066
My parents-in-law has gone to burn joss sticks and pray in town.

286
00:26:58,216 --> 00:26:59,808
You have parents-in-law, so you have a husband?

287
00:27:01,019 --> 00:27:02,611
You can say so.

288
00:27:02,721 --> 00:27:03,619
Where's your husband?

289
00:27:03,922 --> 00:27:05,082
Behind you.

290
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:09,851
Don't scare me.

291
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:15,154
That's true. The one lying in bed.

292
00:27:23,174 --> 00:27:24,732
Dead?

293
00:27:25,844 --> 00:27:28,438
He has never been alive.

294
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:42,927
This is my husband.

295
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:48,731
I married him when I was ten.

296
00:27:49,267 --> 00:27:53,328
I have already lived with this dead wood for ten years.

297
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,171
There is really no way out.

298
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,837
No way out.

299
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:04,437
Let's go.

300
00:28:45,390 --> 00:28:49,258
We are late. Run fast!

301
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:14,674
Brother A'Gui!

302
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:23,686
You got out after all.

303
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:25,057
I got out.

304
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,864
What's the matter with you two?

305
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:32,696
He is my old neighbor, who ran away the year before last.

306
00:29:39,911 --> 00:29:41,742
Does she belong to the propertied class?

307
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:00,159
Go quickly, go!

308
00:30:00,265 --> 00:30:02,130
I can't go now.

309
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,337
Comrades!

310
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:13,741
The reactionary party led by Chiang Kai-shek has deployed 100,000 mobsters

311
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:19,078
to fiercely attack our central District in Jiangxi.

312
00:30:19,184 --> 00:30:22,945
Workers and peasants all over China

313
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:28,855
are fighting hard every second, every hour and every day.

314
00:30:30,028 --> 00:30:34,171
Therefore, our party calls on you.

315
00:30:34,172 --> 00:30:38,436
All suffering women to take up arms

316
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:41,972
and open fire on the extremely evil old society.

317
00:30:42,073 --> 00:30:44,166
Down with feudal rule!

318
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,334
Carry out land reform!

319
00:30:46,477 --> 00:30:48,672
Overturn the feudal system!

320
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:56,380
Now, on behalf of the Hainan Independent Division of the Red Army,

321
00:30:56,454 --> 00:30:59,446
the Hainan Special Committee of the Chinese Communist Party,

322
00:30:59,524 --> 00:31:02,550
I confer on you the flag of our army.

323
00:31:27,585 --> 00:31:29,712
Is the flag receiver a female official?

324
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:31,982
There are no officials in our party. She is the company commander.

325
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,455
Company commander?

326
00:31:33,558 --> 00:31:34,786
How powerful is the position?

327
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:37,326
She's in charge of all the women soldiers.

328
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:39,794
I will go find her.

329
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,593
It won't work.

330
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:42,399
It will.

331
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:46,297
Forwarch march.

332
00:31:46,437 --> 00:31:47,461
Forward march.

333
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:51,508
The fighter's responsibility is heavy; women's animosity is strong.

334
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:54,821
There was Hua Mulan in ancient times who joined the army

335
00:31:54,822 --> 00:31:56,512
taking the place of her father.

336
00:31:56,614 --> 00:32:00,710
There is a women army's using guns to protect the people nowadays.

337
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:02,308
Forward march.

338
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,318
Forward march.

339
00:32:03,454 --> 00:32:07,481
The fighter's responsibility is heavy; women's animosity is strong.

340
00:32:07,592 --> 00:32:12,359
Communism is our creed. The Communist Party is our leader

341
00:32:12,463 --> 00:32:16,490
Slaves get freedom. Slaves get freedom.

342
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,159
Forward march.

343
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:19,099
Forward march.

344
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:23,196
The fighter's responsibility is heavy; women's animosity is strong.

345
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:26,072
One, two, three, four.

346
00:32:27,245 --> 00:32:30,544
One, two, three, four.

347
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:33,845
One, two, three, four.

348
00:32:41,993 --> 00:32:46,623
One, two, one, one, two, three, four.

349
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:48,755
One, two, three, four.

350
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:50,993
Common people, don't follow us.

351
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,536
We are parading here.

352
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:59,675
One, two, one, one, two, one.

353
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:01,642
Why are you still following us?

354
00:33:01,746 --> 00:33:04,214
This is a troop.

355
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:09,096
Stand at attention.

356
00:33:09,097 --> 00:33:15,285
Turn left, put down the guns, stand at ease.

357
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,084
Company commander!

358
00:33:17,195 --> 00:33:19,425
Two common people appeared for no reason.

359
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:20,519
Stand at attention and report.

360
00:33:20,631 --> 00:33:23,828
How do I report it?

361
00:33:26,704 --> 00:33:28,399
Report!

362
00:33:28,539 --> 00:33:29,836
Two common people came here.

363
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:35,842
What do you want?

364
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,437
We came here to join the women army.

365
00:33:38,816 --> 00:33:40,875
You came here when the troops were parading.

366
00:33:40,985 --> 00:33:42,475
You are very brave.

367
00:33:42,587 --> 00:33:45,215
I'm brave. I dare to do anything.

368
00:33:47,892 --> 00:33:49,257
Are you a member of proletariat?

369
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:50,954
What?

370
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,222
Do you own land?

371
00:33:53,598 --> 00:33:55,896
I'm a slave girl. I own nothing.

372
00:33:57,068 --> 00:33:58,592
Good. You pass.

373
00:33:58,736 --> 00:33:59,794
What about you?

374
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:02,462
I'm not sure whether I own land or not.

375
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:04,165
I was sold to others at the age of ten.

376
00:34:04,275 --> 00:34:05,799
You are certainly a proletarian.

377
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:06,706
Pass.

378
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,316
Quiet!

379
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:18,184
You should go through some formalities now.

380
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:23,419
Aren't you the company commander? You can make the decisions.

381
00:34:25,129 --> 00:34:28,826
Calm down, calm down.

382
00:34:30,968 --> 00:34:33,801
You go to apply and explain clearly why you are here.

383
00:34:33,938 --> 00:34:39,376
Why did I come here? There's no need to ask why.

384
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,944
Just for this.

385
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:45,278
I want to rebel and take revenge.

386
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:48,266
I will kill the officials, those big bellies,

387
00:34:48,267 --> 00:34:49,443
who eat human beings.

388
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,282
I will rip off their dog skins.

389
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:54,986
I, I...

390
00:35:04,569 --> 00:35:06,059
Secretary Changqing.

391
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:17,144
Division commander, this is the female comrade I told you about.

392
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:20,350
OK, let her stay.

393
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,247
OK.

394
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:29,859
You can stay.

395
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:33,463
I have an elder sister.

396
00:35:33,931 --> 00:35:35,922
Fine, stand in the troop.

397
00:35:36,834 --> 00:35:37,732
Let's go!

398
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,025
Stand at attention!

399
00:35:42,026 --> 00:35:46,072
Now the party representative will give a speech. Stand at ease!

400
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:55,241
Comrades, you are the first armed force of the Chinese women's revolution.

401
00:35:56,754 --> 00:36:00,747
In the past, you are female workers who suffer from lots of oppression.

402
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:02,860
You lived a bitter life like cattle.

403
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,656
You were looked down upon.

404
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:11,295
But from now on, you 120 persons

405
00:36:12,370 --> 00:36:17,706
no, 122 persons, have become honorable soldiers

406
00:38:10,087 --> 00:38:11,611
Most importantly,

407
00:38:11,689 --> 00:38:14,927
remember that Nan Batian has newly built the firepower positions

408
00:38:14,928 --> 00:38:16,820
of the blockhouse at the southern gate.

409
00:38:18,562 --> 00:38:19,790
OK, let's go.

410
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:28,168
Don't expose your identity as women soldiers.

411
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:30,263
Let's go.

412
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:53,090
Come here quickly. You see.

413
00:38:58,003 --> 00:39:00,563
Their project is nearly completed.

414
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:10,605
They've added three firepower positions.

415
00:39:15,281 --> 00:39:16,151
Some people are coming.

416
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,091
They are visiting the graves to cherish the memory of the dead.

418
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:27,720
Take cover for a moment.

419
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:28,660
OK.

420
00:39:58,095 --> 00:39:59,221
What are you going to do?

421
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:02,127
Nan Batian!

422
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,873
No. You will violate the scouting rules.

423
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:11,939
I'm violating the rules.

424
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,968
I, I will kill him, kill him! Let go!

425
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:21,385
Put it down, hurry, put it down!

426
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:24,420
Master, try the bullets of your servant.

427
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:32,458
Go get the Communist Party. Quick. Go catch them quickly. Go!

428
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,360
You are exposed. Withdraw.

429
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:46,571
In your head there's only revenge, revenge. You feel exhilarated!

430
00:40:48,913 --> 00:40:51,404
But don't you know the scouting rules!

431
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:54,011
Why didn't you stop her?

432
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,245
I tried to stop her, but failed.

433
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:58,685
You failed, which is equal to not taking action.

434
00:40:58,789 --> 00:40:59,778
I regret it.

435
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:00,652
What?

436
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:04,524
I didn't shoot well and there were not enough bullets.

437
00:41:04,662 --> 00:41:07,825
or else I would kill them all!

438
00:41:07,932 --> 00:41:09,524
Do you think this is brave?

439
00:41:09,667 --> 00:41:13,677
You are not the wild girl of three months ago.

440
00:41:13,678 --> 00:41:15,128
You are a soldier.

441
00:41:16,373 --> 00:41:19,308
Do you think as a company commander I would love your bravery?

442
00:41:20,511 --> 00:41:22,411
You go out and break your path by yourself.

443
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:25,608
You don't need me?

444
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:36,058
Company commander, you still let me stay though I'm two years older than her.

445
00:41:36,193 --> 00:41:37,683
Go first.

446
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:56,839
How could you do this?

447
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:58,209
I?

448
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:03,445
What's the matter with you?

449
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:06,747
I just wish iron could turn into steel.

450
00:42:06,891 --> 00:42:08,916
It is not so good to take such a measure.

451
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:12,925
Don't cry.

452
00:42:19,036 --> 00:42:23,063
I violated the rules, but I won't leave.

453
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,801
I can't leave the women's army.

454
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:25,967
But why did you shoot?

455
00:42:26,110 --> 00:42:28,408
It concerns my family's two generations of animosity.

456
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:32,207
Do you think only you have animosity?

457
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:37,916
Every proletarian bears tears in his heart.

458
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:40,582
If everyone rushes like you, can it work?

459
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:44,625
You are a revolutionary soldier.

460
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:52,263
I got it. I won't violate the rules when scouting.

461
00:42:54,738 --> 00:42:59,107
Not only when scouting, you mustn't violate the rules for the rest of your life.

462
00:43:01,445 --> 00:43:04,573
Go to the Confined Room and reflect upon your mistakes.

463
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:05,875
Yes.

464
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,282
She violated the scouting rules,

465
00:43:08,352 --> 00:43:11,788
but I didn't handle it well, I apologize.

466
00:43:12,022 --> 00:43:13,420
-I will go reflect upon my mistakes.
-Go quickly!

467
00:43:13,424 --> 00:43:17,155
I'm also to blame. I will go to the Confined Room with her.

468
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,752
This is new.

469
00:43:21,031 --> 00:43:23,363
All right. You go and help her.

470
00:43:24,368 --> 00:43:25,392
Yes.

471
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:45,051
Sister Lian.

472
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,226
Enlightened?

473
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:57,526
Actually, I'm quite fond of our company commander.

474
00:43:57,635 --> 00:43:59,000
She is frank and outspoken.

475
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,400
But she wants to drive me away.

476
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:06,802
I always take the lead in our work, such as military training and fighting battles.

477
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:08,741
You took the lead in violating rules, too.

478
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:13,574
It's only three months since I joined the army.

479
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:17,346
In terms of years, Secretary Changqing has been in the army only for two years.

480
00:44:17,454 --> 00:44:19,615
Can we conclude that men are better than women?

481
00:44:19,723 --> 00:44:20,815
How can you say that?

482
00:44:34,672 --> 00:44:39,568
-You see, Secretary Changqing is really...
-Really what?

483
00:44:40,911 --> 00:44:45,041
Secretary Changqing also teaches us lessons and punishes us.

484
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:50,314
However, when he punishes us, we are sincerely convinced.

485
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,752
Secretary Changqing has made such rapid progress.

486
00:44:54,458 --> 00:44:58,053
Qionghua, we must learn from him.

487
00:44:58,195 --> 00:44:59,822
We should try our best and make progress.

488
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:04,093
Sister Lian, let's discuss it little by little.

489
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:05,635
OK.

490
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:32,091
Why didn't you fall asleep?

491
00:45:32,196 --> 00:45:33,458
I'm thinking.

492
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:34,859
What are you thinking about?

493
00:45:36,633 --> 00:45:41,730
Sister Lian, could you tell me why Secretary Changqing

494
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:45,673
and our company commander are more knowledgeable and farsighted?

495
00:45:46,777 --> 00:45:48,711
Because they are communists?

496
00:45:51,281 --> 00:45:53,112
Yes.

497
00:45:56,453 --> 00:46:02,756
Sister Lian, we will be senior soldiers two or three years from now.

498
00:46:02,893 --> 00:46:06,385
We will act like our company commander and Secretary Changqing.

499
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:11,365
At that time, we both can also join the Communist Party.

500
00:46:11,502 --> 00:46:14,403
Yes! To fight for the common people who suffer a lot!

501
00:46:14,905 --> 00:46:17,354
Sister Lian, we joined the army together.

502
00:46:17,355 --> 00:46:20,036
We will join the Communist Party together, too.

503
00:46:20,978 --> 00:46:26,177
Do you believe in me? I will straighten out.

504
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:29,275
I believe in you. Qionghua, I believe in you.

505
00:46:31,522 --> 00:46:32,546
Sleep.

506
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:42,696
One, one, two, one.

507
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:50,966
You're making use of every minute! Dinner is here.

508
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:54,043
Thank you, elder sister.

509
00:46:54,144 --> 00:46:55,839
Take your time.

510
00:47:01,852 --> 00:47:05,151
Qionghua, we will attack that Nan Batian you mentioned.

511
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:06,819
-Really?
-Really.

512
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:09,890
The mayor has approved. We will attack him tonight.

513
00:47:09,993 --> 00:47:11,551
Attack him tonight?

514
00:47:14,164 --> 00:47:20,413
I have to attack Nan Batian myself.

515
00:47:20,414 --> 00:47:25,234
Can I walk out of the door?

516
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:28,175
Hey, nobody is watching you. You can go.

517
00:47:29,279 --> 00:47:34,080
No. I must be aware.

518
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,414
I will beg for leniency for you.

519
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:44,491
She is really the right person to go.

520
00:47:44,628 --> 00:47:46,653
Why didn't she come herself?

521
00:47:46,763 --> 00:47:50,494
She said she couldn't go out of the Confined Room. She had to be aware.

522
00:47:55,005 --> 00:47:58,031
All right. You tell her to go back to her platoon and wait for the order.

524
00:47:58,141 --> 00:47:59,005
OK.

525
00:48:07,317 --> 00:48:09,241
Nan Batian is still waiting for me to discuss

526
00:48:09,242 --> 00:48:10,286
some big matters together.

527
00:48:11,188 --> 00:48:14,988
I think we can use this plan again.

528
00:48:15,092 --> 00:48:17,458
Oh, it's been more than three months.

529
00:48:17,594 --> 00:48:19,229
After watching the geomantic omens

530
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:21,826
and repairing the ancestral hall, it's the right time.

531
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:23,365
Now many independent regimes are setting up by force of arms everywhere.

532
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:26,197
Nan Batian cannot know my whereabouts.

533
00:48:26,303 --> 00:48:29,238
I will pretend to be an overseas Chinese merchant prince again.

534
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:33,332
Let's catch Nan Batian so that the enemy will lose their commander-in-chief.

535
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:36,270
What do you think?

536
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:39,413
We will be safer...

537
00:48:39,549 --> 00:48:42,313
but Secretary Changqing has to take the risk.

538
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:43,282
Don't worry.

539
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:46,252
The mayor has already approved our plan.

540
00:48:47,391 --> 00:48:51,885
The time for general attack is one a. m.

541
00:49:00,404 --> 00:49:04,704
If we succeed in the city, then 6:36.

542
00:49:20,357 --> 00:49:21,255
Check hers.

543
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:41,807
Go away. Go away!

544
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:18,545
Brother Hong, why did you give me such great presents?

545
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:20,115
Just local products.

546
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:24,313
Old majordomo, dispense them to the underlings to share in the master's good fortune.

548
00:50:28,492 --> 00:50:29,789
Express my thanks to him on my behalf.

549
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:39,794
Why does Brother Nan feel uncomfortable?

550
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:43,202
Because of the attempted assassination by the Communist Party.

551
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:46,742
Oh, they really did that?

552
00:50:48,812 --> 00:50:53,010
I swear not to stop if I cannot avenge the animosity of a bullet.

553
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:57,549
Old Four, have you caught the murderer?

554
00:50:57,687 --> 00:50:59,314
I caught more than 20 suspects.

555
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:03,754
Well done. Use third degree for me.

556
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:04,952
Yes.

557
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:08,531
It's the right time for Brother Hong to come.

558
00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:10,955
As regards the issue we talked about last time,

559
00:51:11,356 --> 00:51:12,293
I wonder whether you...

560
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:14,968
I have made up my mind.

561
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:20,543
Even if I dissipate my fortune, I will do my best to help govern Hainan.

562
00:51:20,677 --> 00:51:22,907
Oh! My dear friend is so courageous and resolute.

563
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,546
Prepare the wine. Give a dinner of welcome to Mr. Hong.

564
00:51:30,153 --> 00:51:32,621
I happened to catch a cold.

565
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:36,556
I am afraid I can't have dinner with you. Moreover, Brother Nan?

566
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:40,406
Since Mr. Hong is not very well,

567
00:51:40,407 --> 00:51:43,065
being travel-worn and exhausted

568
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:45,100
please go to bed early.

569
00:51:59,382 --> 00:52:00,849
How are things going with the attack?

570
00:52:00,984 --> 00:52:02,383
Nothing special.

571
00:52:18,401 --> 00:52:22,786
Then... why did Qionghua begin to obey the law

572
00:52:22,787 --> 00:52:24,465
and behave herself?

573
00:52:25,742 --> 00:52:27,642
Don't worry about her.

574
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:31,611
She has become the senior slave girl who found favor with her master.

575
00:52:34,918 --> 00:52:38,979
It seems that the stratagem of sending Qionghua is right.

576
00:52:39,256 --> 00:52:43,158
We still don't know the exact details of Mr. Hong.

577
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:48,274
He has to pass through the Communist area whenever he comes and goes.

578
00:52:48,275 --> 00:52:50,260
Why can he pass through so freely?

579
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:54,132
What's more, this time he came so suddenly.

580
00:52:54,271 --> 00:53:00,039
So... you think there is something wrong with him?

581
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:03,607
I am not sure now.

582
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:10,451
But to say the least, Mr. Hong is noble and arrogant

583
00:53:10,452 --> 00:53:13,679
when making friends with others.

584
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:17,365
He can't be a person to work together with for long

585
00:53:17,366 --> 00:53:19,659
and be willing to be a subordinate.

586
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:26,332
If he is a blockhead, why did I make friends with him?

587
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:27,731
Master.

588
00:53:27,871 --> 00:53:32,604
Getting hold of such a plutocratic person can help me to succeed.

589
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:41,009
Master, if you accepted my advice the day before yesterday,

590
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:45,417
there wouldn't be accidents when you visited the cemetery to honor the dead.

591
00:53:51,995 --> 00:53:58,559
Just to avenge the animosity, I must take action immediately.

592
00:53:58,668 --> 00:54:01,967
Otherwise the Communist Party may rush into my house.

593
00:54:02,772 --> 00:54:03,408
Someone come here! 

594
00:54:07,409 --> 00:54:11,680
Hurry to the mountain and invite Huang Zhenshan to discuss the big plan with me.

595
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:12,481
Yes.

596
00:54:17,454 --> 00:54:19,403
You are over-suspicious.

597
00:54:19,404 --> 00:54:23,950
How can you be victorious being indecisive?

598
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:30,757
Master don't be too careless, or you may lose everything.

599
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:41,869
The back door is near the kitchen.

600
00:54:50,687 --> 00:54:52,279
I'm coming.

601
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:42,337
Old majordomo,

602
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:45,737
Why don't you rest?

603
00:55:47,143 --> 00:55:52,843
Are you still busy? What about coming in to sit for a while?

604
00:55:52,982 --> 00:55:55,382
No, no.

605
00:56:01,991 --> 00:56:03,515
It looks like somebody is watching us.

606
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:34,049
Xiao Pang, you go back to Guangzhou first thing tomorrow.

607
00:56:34,190 --> 00:56:37,664
I will discuss something with the commander-in-chief Mr. Nan.

608
00:56:37,665 --> 00:56:40,186
I've decided to stay here for a few more days.

609
00:56:41,731 --> 00:56:45,030
Master, isn't elder Mrs. Hong waiting for you?

610
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:51,531
Take her here to stay for a few days, too. She can relieve her boredom this way.

611
00:56:55,945 --> 00:56:59,847
I heard it clearly. There is nothing suspicious.

612
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:03,384
They even said they wanted to bring elder Mrs. Hong to stay here.

613
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:37,375
Xiao Pang.

614
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:51,620
Freeze.

615
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:09,006
Along the small road, you can find the way behind the blockhouse.

616
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:22,055
Master, sad days will follow for you to cry.

617
00:59:25,929 --> 00:59:27,157
We are ready.

618
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:28,628
Light three fires right away.

619
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,808
Compatriots, grandmas and sisters,

620
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:19,347
come here and see!

621
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:24,318
Isn't he the squire, evil gentry, vampire

622
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:27,753
and commander-in-chief of the local militia, Nan Batian?

623
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,619
All of you know me, right?

624
01:00:30,727 --> 01:00:36,461
I'm his lackey. He is my master.

625
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,700
My dad kicked his dog once

626
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:43,636
so he was beaten to death by Nan Batian.

627
01:00:44,507 --> 01:00:45,235
Qionghua.

628
01:00:46,609 --> 01:00:47,803
Stop talking about it.

629
01:00:48,845 --> 01:00:50,369
Go.

630
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:57,519
The Communist Party advocates emancipation.

631
01:00:57,620 --> 01:00:59,451
Emancipating collectively.

632
01:00:59,555 --> 01:01:02,149
Men and women are on an equal footing.

633
01:01:02,258 --> 01:01:06,126
I can't believe as a lackey I can have the chance to liberate my life.

634
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:08,928
Down with local tyrants and evil gentry!

635
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:11,125
Down with local tyrants and evil gentry!

636
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:53,702
Xiao Pang, help maintain order!

637
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:55,744
Hey, fellow-villagers, stop fighting!

638
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,072
Be quiet!

639
01:01:57,146 --> 01:02:02,671
Fellow-villagers, hurry to the gate of Nan's house.

640
01:02:02,672 --> 01:02:05,383
There will be a big meeting.

641
01:02:05,488 --> 01:02:06,955
Execute Nan Batian by shooting him!

642
01:02:11,327 --> 01:02:12,123
Take him inside under escort.

643
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:41,088
Don't move.

644
01:02:41,524 --> 01:02:42,991
I want to go to the toilet.

645
01:02:53,169 --> 01:02:54,431
Be quick.

646
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:13,913
-Where is he?
-Inside

647
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:14,988
Come out!

648
01:03:19,428 --> 01:03:22,761
Come on.

649
01:04:10,513 --> 01:04:11,707
Dare you run?

650
01:04:18,221 --> 01:04:19,279
Master!

651
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:23,288
Master!

652
01:04:24,660 --> 01:04:26,193
Master!

653
01:04:26,295 --> 01:04:29,162
Hurry up. Hurry up.

654
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:43,172
There he is.

655
01:04:53,823 --> 01:04:54,983
Qionghua!

656
01:05:14,844 --> 01:05:15,742
I'm finished.

657
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:27,086
How is she?

658
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:31,622
She can bear it without an anesthetic.

659
01:05:34,230 --> 01:05:37,597
How strong the girl is!

660
01:05:48,644 --> 01:05:51,943
Qionghua, how do you feel?

661
01:05:52,448 --> 01:05:53,656
Nothing.

662
01:05:53,957 --> 01:05:59,957
It's much better than the the landholder's whip.

663
01:07:02,551 --> 01:07:03,779
Secretary Changqing.

664
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:05,980
Qionghua.

665
01:07:09,992 --> 01:07:11,789
Have you recovered from the wound?

666
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:12,952
Yes.

667
01:07:14,797 --> 01:07:17,925
Come here. Sit down and take a rest. Give it to me.

668
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:33,344
We passed by this place again.

669
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:42,380
Yes. It was last autumn when we left Nan Batian's home.

670
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:46,091
It seems that it happened long ago.

671
01:07:47,296 --> 01:07:48,763
The change is quite dramatic.

672
01:07:50,066 --> 01:07:53,502
Now the District has expanded. Everything has changed.

673
01:07:56,105 --> 01:07:57,504
So have the people.

674
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:04,976
You know at that time, I hated you and suspected you.

675
01:08:05,081 --> 01:08:09,211
It was... was interesting.

676
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:17,591
There is one thing I am a little afraid to tell you.

677
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:19,751
What is it? Tell me.

678
01:08:25,734 --> 01:08:29,363
I want to go into the county after dressing up.

679
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:31,906
And I will get the head of Nan Batian while at the temple market.

680
01:08:32,007 --> 01:08:33,304
How many people will go with you?

681
01:08:33,409 --> 01:08:34,706
I can handle it alone.

682
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:37,741
What if you can't?

683
01:08:38,848 --> 01:08:40,247
He will kill me.

684
01:08:50,926 --> 01:08:55,159
The reason I go to kill Nan Batian is for the glory of the women's army.

685
01:08:55,160 --> 01:08:56,159
Isn't that right?

686
01:08:57,366 --> 01:09:03,794
Even individual sacrifice is glorious, isn't it?

687
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:08,572
Uncle.

688
01:09:09,411 --> 01:09:10,869
-You're back.
-Yes.

689
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,547
Come here and sit down beside me.

690
01:09:13,649 --> 01:09:14,547
I want to talk with you.

691
01:09:39,875 --> 01:09:43,538
Qionghua, find our Hainan Island.

692
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,288
It's here. Look at it.

693
01:09:55,324 --> 01:09:56,484
It is so small.

694
01:09:57,426 --> 01:09:59,360
Then point out our Coconut Grove.

695
01:10:03,432 --> 01:10:05,297
I can't find it.

696
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:11,899
You are right. The place we passed just now is so big.

697
01:10:12,875 --> 01:10:15,935
But on the map, it's nothing.

698
01:10:18,013 --> 01:10:20,504
Qionghua, think about it.

699
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:25,946
Only depending on personal courage, can we liberate such a big country?

700
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:34,920
You are good at enlightening people.

701
01:10:35,764 --> 01:10:38,324
Don't laugh. I am being honest.

702
01:10:48,911 --> 01:10:53,473
I don't know why you know so many things...

703
01:10:53,616 --> 01:10:55,743
read so many books...

704
01:10:56,785 --> 01:10:58,116
have so great knowledge.

705
01:10:59,655 --> 01:11:01,020
I'm not knowledgeable at all.

706
01:11:01,523 --> 01:11:04,754
I went to Southeast Asia for business by ship with my father in my childhood.

708
01:11:05,894 --> 01:11:07,759
I went to school when I was over ten years old.

709
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:11,594
The Ocean Trade Union of Guangzhou offered me money for school.

710
01:11:11,734 --> 01:11:13,998
I wanted to go to the middle school.

711
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:17,060
But...

712
01:11:18,761 --> 01:11:24,509
the trade union was broken by the reactionaries.

713
01:11:25,648 --> 01:11:29,744
They put my father into a gunny-sack and threw him into the Pearl River.

714
01:11:33,555 --> 01:11:34,920
What about your mother?

715
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:38,450
I don't know.

716
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:45,061
After my father died, she became blind.

717
01:12:03,752 --> 01:12:08,121
Every proletarian has a sorrowful history.

718
01:12:09,458 --> 01:12:14,225
Only for this reason the proletarian can light up the landlord's house

719
01:12:14,296 --> 01:12:16,992
and let the fire burn it down.

720
01:12:17,066 --> 01:12:21,025
But if you want to cause a conflagration to burn down the old society

721
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:28,610
you need to firmly rely on the collectivity, the entire class.

722
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:34,479
I've remembered every word you said.

723
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:35,575
Forever.

724
01:12:46,362 --> 01:12:49,229
The entire class.

725
01:14:26,595 --> 01:14:29,723
Comrades! Comrades!

726
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:32,164
We are celebrating the bountiful harvest.

727
01:14:35,637 --> 01:14:40,199
Meanwhile we congratulate A'gui and Honglian on their marriage.

728
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:44,302
We hope this revolutionary couple will be together till the end of their lives

729
01:14:44,413 --> 01:14:45,744
and thoroughly stick to the revolution.

730
01:14:48,317 --> 01:14:50,478
Hey! Let's sing!

731
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:28,013
In conclusion, our army must seize

732
01:16:28,014 --> 01:16:31,748
the key point of the island campaign.

733
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:34,617
That's a sudden and strong attack with concentrated military strength.

734
01:16:34,723 --> 01:16:39,660
Then even the enemy would notice the central troops have already landed.

735
01:16:39,728 --> 01:16:43,495
It will be too late for them to withdraw

736
01:16:43,496 --> 01:16:47,828
the populace and property in the new district.

737
01:16:49,204 --> 01:16:51,104
Because it is on an island

738
01:16:51,873 --> 01:16:56,776
from here to the central zone only takes one day and one night to reach.

739
01:16:57,846 --> 01:17:00,713
Please make a decision.

740
01:17:02,985 --> 01:17:05,146
Friend, don't say anything more.

741
01:17:06,388 --> 01:17:09,634
This time Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek has transferred our army

742
01:17:09,635 --> 01:17:12,486
from the battlefront against the Communist Party to Hainan.

743
01:17:12,594 --> 01:17:15,409
Obviously he has made up his mind to kill

744
01:17:15,410 --> 01:17:18,157
all the Communist Party members in Hainan.

745
01:17:19,835 --> 01:17:23,063
I'm very glad for the favorable cooperation

746
01:17:23,064 --> 01:17:26,365
between the central and the local governments.

747
01:17:27,442 --> 01:17:28,568
Just now this is?

748
01:17:29,711 --> 01:17:31,338
My family name is Nan.

749
01:17:33,715 --> 01:17:38,618
We should pay attention to what Mr. Nan said.

750
01:17:39,621 --> 01:17:41,215
The infantry will be divided into three corps.

751
01:17:41,222 --> 01:17:43,186
Start tonight respectively in the left, middle and right.

752
01:17:44,559 --> 01:17:46,993
We must attack at once.

753
01:17:58,807 --> 01:17:59,967
All right. Take action.

754
01:18:00,075 --> 01:18:01,733
-Comrade Changqing.
-Yes.

755
01:18:01,843 --> 01:18:02,901
The order from the commanding division.

756
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:10,377
The enemy is besieging the District from several directions.

757
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:16,319
Our main force should cut to the rear of the enemy and attack them.

758
01:18:16,425 --> 01:18:20,452
The women's army should transfer two platoons to the main force.

759
01:18:20,562 --> 01:18:23,108
Leave one platoon to intercept the enemy

760
01:18:23,109 --> 01:18:27,627
at the mountain range dividing line which leads to the Soviet District.

761
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:30,467
Be sure to hold Nan Batian's army off

762
01:18:30,605 --> 01:18:35,065
so as to cooperate with the main force to annihilate the enemy.

763
01:18:35,577 --> 01:18:38,876
In order to counter encircle and suppress thoroughly

764
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:42,065
the Party calls on all the comrades to defend

765
01:18:42,066 --> 01:18:45,351
the foundation of the revolution with their lives.

766
01:19:06,007 --> 01:19:07,519
You lead Platoon One and Platoon Two

767
01:19:07,520 --> 01:19:09,408
to the rear of the enemy following the main force.

768
01:19:09,511 --> 01:19:12,947
Platoon Three and other companys follow me and go to the dividing line mountain range.

769
01:19:13,048 --> 01:19:14,379
No, I will go to the dividing line mountain range.

770
01:19:14,549 --> 01:19:16,107
You bring the troops to support the main force.

771
01:19:16,218 --> 01:19:19,415
Don't argue. We don't have time.

772
01:19:20,388 --> 01:19:21,787
You have heavy responsibility, too.

773
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:25,191
Everything is to counter encircle and suppress.

774
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:27,118
Take action right now.

775
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:33,127
We will see each other when we successfully join forces.

776
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:34,633
Goodbye.

777
01:19:41,877 --> 01:19:44,505
Xiao Pang, you go back to the commanding division right now.

778
01:19:44,646 --> 01:19:47,308
Report our situation to the director of the division.

779
01:19:48,216 --> 01:19:52,983
Yes. Comrade Changqing, the enemy is coming.

780
01:19:53,121 --> 01:19:54,486
Don't worry.

781
01:19:56,558 --> 01:20:00,289
It's getting cold. Be careful not to catch cold on the way.

782
01:20:01,496 --> 01:20:03,391
OK. Go.

783
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:12,373
Go quickly.

784
01:20:26,755 --> 01:20:28,882
I'm going to the rear of the enemy following the main force.

785
01:20:34,429 --> 01:20:37,049
You have been pregnant for seven or eight months.

786
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:37,887
At this time I...

787
01:20:39,067 --> 01:20:40,762
Oh, don't worry about me.

788
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:45,097
The baby will accompany me this year.

789
01:20:57,352 --> 01:20:58,319
How about your health?

790
01:20:58,386 --> 01:21:00,320
I feel good, sisters.

791
01:21:00,422 --> 01:21:03,789
You have a fighting mission, so leave the work to me.

792
01:21:03,892 --> 01:21:06,383
I am sure that I will move the wounded and family numbers to a safe place.

793
01:21:06,494 --> 01:21:08,121
All right. Let's go.

794
01:21:12,100 --> 01:21:13,067
Go.

795
01:21:38,727 --> 01:21:39,785
Take a look.

796
01:21:51,873 --> 01:21:53,704
Let's go.

797
01:22:10,425 --> 01:22:11,392
Take cover quickly.

798
01:22:11,526 --> 01:22:14,825
Quick. Aunt Bai, here.

799
01:22:16,831 --> 01:22:17,731
Be ready to fight.

800
01:22:19,501 --> 01:22:21,311
If we miss the chance, the main force

801
01:22:21,312 --> 01:22:23,562
of the Communist Party will start to move.

802
01:22:23,672 --> 01:22:27,303
I have experience with the army of the Communist Party.

803
01:22:27,304 --> 01:22:29,508
Fighting in dark is not good for us.

804
01:22:29,644 --> 01:22:34,138
Only if their main force is truly here, can we use the bombardment.

805
01:23:12,554 --> 01:23:14,044
Centralize firepower. Rush to the floor of the bridge.

806
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:47,481
They are not the main force. There are women in the battlefield.

807
01:23:47,589 --> 01:23:52,117
This is a tactic of the Communist Party. Don't look down upon these women.

808
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:54,855
Master, they don't look like the main force.

809
01:24:04,706 --> 01:24:06,298
Save the bullets.

810
01:25:09,704 --> 01:25:12,298
Comrades, we absolutely cannot let the enemy march.

811
01:25:33,495 --> 01:25:35,463
The enemy was beaten back by us again.

812
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:39,850
Concentrate the bullets.

813
01:25:39,852 --> 01:25:41,159
Be ready for the enemy's counterattack.

814
01:25:50,845 --> 01:25:52,676
The wounded in Squad One and Squad Two withdraw right now.

815
01:25:52,814 --> 01:25:55,612
Yes. But...?

816
01:25:55,717 --> 01:25:58,777
We have finished the mission. Squad Three and I will cover you.

817
01:25:59,921 --> 01:26:02,981
No, all of you withdraw. I will cover you.

818
01:26:05,093 --> 01:26:10,258
Follow orders, Comrade Qionghua.

819
01:26:10,965 --> 01:26:14,662
The Party has approved your application.

820
01:26:15,803 --> 01:26:22,675
From now on, you are not merely an ordinary soldier but a proletarian pioneer fighter.

821
01:26:27,415 --> 01:26:29,110
If we can't withdraw from the battlefield,

822
01:26:32,086 --> 01:26:36,216
the party members who withdrew will become the future fighting force

823
01:26:36,324 --> 01:26:39,122
and fight until victory.

824
01:26:39,727 --> 01:26:40,887
I've remembered all.

825
01:26:42,330 --> 01:26:46,323
If we are separated by the enemy, you should hinder Nan Batian.

826
01:26:50,805 --> 01:26:55,469
Well, take up the first task after joining the Communist Party.

827
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:57,908
Yes, Branch Secretary-in-chief.

828
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:20,953
Here are my first membership dues.

829
01:27:20,954 --> 01:27:23,227
If we are cut off, hand them in on my behalf.

830
01:27:48,730 --> 01:27:49,822
Catch them alive!

831
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:43,044
Aunt Bai, go!

832
01:29:02,904 --> 01:29:06,499
This is the first baby in our women army.

833
01:29:11,145 --> 01:29:13,773
Our little woman soldier.

834
01:29:17,585 --> 01:29:18,831
Sister Qionghua.

835
01:29:24,088 --> 01:29:25,617
The situation on the battlefield is still unknown.

836
01:29:29,731 --> 01:29:33,258
Big Sister, you tell the others to check the weapons.

837
01:29:33,401 --> 01:29:36,564
Collect the bullets. I will go to the front to have a look and return soon.

838
01:29:36,704 --> 01:29:41,573
Be sure to take good care of Sister Honglian.

839
01:29:41,709 --> 01:29:42,437
Just go.

840
01:30:17,845 --> 01:30:21,000
The main force, where is the main force?

841
01:30:23,527 --> 01:30:26,651
So strange and unusual.

842
01:30:28,856 --> 01:30:30,050
Battalion leader.

843
01:30:30,158 --> 01:30:36,097
We got two companies killed in the river by a small group of the women's army.

844
01:30:37,365 --> 01:30:39,890
If without my brother Zhenshan...

845
01:30:40,568 --> 01:30:45,369
Get rid of these women. Damn it!

846
01:30:45,473 --> 01:30:48,271
We must annihilate the Communist Party in this district.

847
01:30:49,210 --> 01:30:53,510
Though the women's army is a small group, it destroys the peace of the whole county.

848
01:30:53,681 --> 01:30:56,275
Even women can shoot me.

849
01:30:56,384 --> 01:31:00,650
Later everybody dares to revolt against the government.

850
01:31:00,788 --> 01:31:05,657
Oh, did we come here to protect you and your house?

851
01:31:05,760 --> 01:31:06,460
Report.

852
01:31:16,804 --> 01:31:19,671
Our brigade was beaten by the Communist army and is in disorder.

853
01:31:20,308 --> 01:31:22,276
Tomorrow in the early morning we will move to the brigade base.

854
01:31:22,376 --> 01:31:23,240
Withdraw from this damn place!

855
01:31:23,377 --> 01:31:24,077
Yes.

856
01:31:26,514 --> 01:31:28,505
It's time to withdraw.

857
01:31:38,526 --> 01:31:40,892
Master, he came round again.

858
01:31:44,298 --> 01:31:48,029
Bring him to me.

859
01:32:26,641 --> 01:32:32,307
I regarded you highly the first time I met you.

860
01:32:33,381 --> 01:32:39,377
I haven't changed, Mr. Hong.

861
01:32:42,990 --> 01:32:46,501
If you can get the women army to surrender to us,

862
01:32:46,502 --> 01:32:49,520
you can have high position and great wealth.

863
01:33:04,412 --> 01:33:09,543
All right, I will give you several minutes to think about it.

864
01:34:50,551 --> 01:34:56,751
All right. For your communism, I will kill you.

865
01:34:56,891 --> 01:35:01,089
Bring him outside. Bring him outside. Bring him outside.

866
01:35:46,073 --> 01:35:49,201
Long Live China!

867
01:35:49,343 --> 01:35:52,369
Down with the Nationalist Party's dominion!

868
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:56,849
Long Live the Chinese Communist Party!

869
01:38:34,675 --> 01:38:36,204
-Sister Lian.
-Qionghua.

870
01:38:38,479 --> 01:38:42,347
What's the situation on the battlefield? Where is Comrade Changqing?

871
01:38:45,386 --> 01:38:48,355
-Sister Qionghua. 
-Qionghua.

872
01:38:50,557 --> 01:38:54,391
All the comrades on the battlefield have sacrificed fearlessly.

873
01:39:00,634 --> 01:39:04,195
Comrade Changqing sacrificed gloriously.

874
01:39:21,255 --> 01:39:24,656
Don't cry. What are you crying for?

875
01:39:24,792 --> 01:39:27,192
We should avenge Comrade Changqing.

876
01:39:27,328 --> 01:39:29,455
Let's go! Go! Fight against them with our lives.

877
01:39:29,563 --> 01:39:35,468
Comrades, we should take revenge, but not in an impulsive way.

878
01:39:37,071 --> 01:39:38,265
Then what should we do?

879
01:39:38,372 --> 01:39:41,466
We left the division and the Party representative was sacrificed.

880
01:39:47,881 --> 01:39:53,547
We still have you. We still have the Communist Party.

881
01:39:58,525 --> 01:39:59,924
Wipe away your tears.

882
01:40:02,096 --> 01:40:05,896
The enemy's fire can only burn one of our communist members to death.

883
01:40:06,033 --> 01:40:07,295
It won't scare us.

884
01:40:08,335 --> 01:40:11,998
Together we'll light a big fire

885
01:40:12,106 --> 01:40:15,837
to burn down the enemy as well as the entire old society.

886
01:40:16,643 --> 01:40:20,443
Sisters, comrades!

887
01:40:21,548 --> 01:40:23,709
We should take the responsibility that the martyr left to us.

888
01:40:39,733 --> 01:40:40,825
Gather round.

889
01:40:45,072 --> 01:40:46,596
Forward march...

890
01:40:46,673 --> 01:40:47,970
forward march.

891
01:40:48,042 --> 01:40:52,877
The fighter's responsibility is heavy; women's animosity is strong.

892
01:40:53,013 --> 01:40:56,859
There was Hua Mulan in ancient times who joined the army,

893
01:40:56,860 --> 01:40:58,815
taking the place of her father.

894
01:40:58,919 --> 01:41:04,016
There is a women's army using guns to protect the people nowadays.

895
01:41:04,124 --> 01:41:05,955
Forward march...

896
01:41:06,093 --> 01:41:07,321
forward march.

897
01:41:07,461 --> 01:41:12,364
The fighter's responsibility is heavy; women's animosity is strong.

898
01:41:17,805 --> 01:41:19,033
A'gui, we caught them!

899
01:41:19,173 --> 01:41:20,504
We've caught them. They are just part of the army.

900
01:41:22,643 --> 01:41:23,632
Oh, is the division commander here?

901
01:41:23,744 --> 01:41:24,444
Yes.

902
01:41:26,180 --> 01:41:26,976
Report.

903
01:41:27,848 --> 01:41:28,872
You are back.

904
01:41:28,982 --> 01:41:29,812
Yes.

905
01:41:29,950 --> 01:41:31,178
Is Nan Batian planning to run away?

906
01:41:31,285 --> 01:41:33,185
Yes, he is preparing to run off to Haikou.

907
01:41:35,489 --> 01:41:38,253
Where is the women's army that we left there?

908
01:41:38,392 --> 01:41:42,226
Nan Batian is a guerrilla in the district where Comrade Changqing was.

909
01:41:43,230 --> 01:41:48,691
Good. You take off right now and find the women's army.

910
01:41:49,703 --> 01:41:54,333
Tell them we have succeeded in countering encircling and suppression.

911
01:41:55,409 --> 01:42:00,779
Our main force will turn back for the frontal attack tomorrow.

912
01:42:01,715 --> 01:42:07,456
Ask them to try their best to encumber Nan Batian

913
01:42:07,457 --> 01:42:11,590
until six o'clock tomorrow afternoon.

914
01:42:12,826 --> 01:42:13,850
Yes.

915
01:42:15,662 --> 01:42:18,790
Tomorrow you are required to insist upon until six p. m.

916
01:42:20,234 --> 01:42:22,099
The division commander said maybe you don't have enough force,

917
01:42:22,202 --> 01:42:24,762
but can drag one of Nan Batian's legs.

918
01:42:25,739 --> 01:42:29,766
Yes. Insist on until six p. m. tomorrow.

919
01:42:29,910 --> 01:42:30,733
-Who is that?
-I.

920
01:42:31,612 --> 01:42:33,307
Dan Zhu is back.

921
01:42:33,914 --> 01:42:36,109
Qionghua, Nan Batian intended to run away.

922
01:42:37,084 --> 01:42:41,145
Before he ran off, he caught a great number of civilians in Coconut Grove.

923
01:42:41,255 --> 01:42:43,280
What about uncle? Was he caught?

924
01:42:43,390 --> 01:42:44,550
He is waiting for the slaughter.

925
01:42:45,325 --> 01:42:46,656
It is a new situation.

926
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:47,784
Yes, it is.

927
01:42:47,928 --> 01:42:49,395
But we only get 20 guns.

928
01:42:49,496 --> 01:42:51,828
So what! We are sure to hit him,

929
01:42:51,932 --> 01:42:52,956
exerting the utmost strength to fight.

930
01:42:53,267 --> 01:42:55,462
Qionghua, what do you think?

931
01:42:55,569 --> 01:42:57,230
We can risk our lives if you decide.

932
01:42:57,371 --> 01:42:58,702
Yes, just speak out.

933
01:43:00,607 --> 01:43:05,510
We won't risk our lives. We will kill Nan Batian.

934
01:43:05,979 --> 01:43:08,846
If we are late, hundreds of comrades may be killed.

935
01:43:09,550 --> 01:43:10,778
Just give your order.

936
01:43:11,785 --> 01:43:14,982
We will follow anything you say.

937
01:43:21,061 --> 01:43:22,426
Ask the team to have a meeting.

938
01:43:36,410 --> 01:43:41,780
Master, we've caught all the people.

939
01:43:42,916 --> 01:43:46,716
Well, let's go to meet them.

940
01:43:54,595 --> 01:43:56,062
Quick!

941
01:44:04,571 --> 01:44:09,304
Long live the farmers! I will offer my congratulations to you.

942
01:44:11,645 --> 01:44:15,092
To prevent you from digging

943
01:44:15,093 --> 01:44:19,177
my ancestral grave after I leave,

944
01:44:19,286 --> 01:44:21,811
I will kill you all now.

945
01:44:26,860 --> 01:44:32,162
However, whoever shouts "Down with the Communist Party" once

946
01:44:33,333 --> 01:44:35,164
I will let him live.

947
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:42,404
Why, nobody wants to shout?

948
01:44:47,314 --> 01:44:49,009
Down with local tyrants and evil gentry!

949
01:44:49,116 --> 01:44:51,147
Down with the landlord!

950
01:44:51,251 --> 01:44:52,718
Long live the farmers!

951
01:44:52,819 --> 01:44:54,377
Long live the farmers!

952
01:44:56,223 --> 01:44:57,850
Hurry up. Move quickly

953
01:44:59,359 --> 01:45:00,059
Don't move!

954
01:45:01,028 --> 01:45:02,325
Quick.

955
01:45:02,429 --> 01:45:03,157
Don't move!

956
01:45:03,897 --> 01:45:05,091
Quick, come with me!

957
01:45:05,866 --> 01:45:06,992
Down with the landlord!

958
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:09,864
Don't fire. Tie them up. Catch them!

959
01:45:22,749 --> 01:45:25,081
Tie him up!

960
01:45:27,087 --> 01:45:28,111
Don't move!

961
01:45:28,221 --> 01:45:29,483
Ah, Brother Fourth!

962
01:45:29,589 --> 01:45:31,716
Don't move!

963
01:45:31,825 --> 01:45:33,816
If there is anybody who dares to move I will kill your commander-in-chief first!

964
01:45:36,930 --> 01:45:37,794
Take them away!

965
01:45:44,071 --> 01:45:46,631
It's the women's army!

966
01:46:00,654 --> 01:46:03,419
To tell you the truth, the main force of the Red Army

967
01:46:03,420 --> 01:46:06,388
has already foiled the attack of the central bandit troops.

968
01:46:06,493 --> 01:46:08,552
They are matching towards this county.

969
01:46:11,131 --> 01:46:13,964
Disarm and surrender right away.

970
01:46:15,068 --> 01:46:16,433
I will die for a righteous cause.

971
01:46:16,536 --> 01:46:21,940
I will sacrifice. I will die for my country. I, I...

972
01:46:22,042 --> 01:46:27,344
Good. I will help you to fulfill your wishes.

973
01:46:35,255 --> 01:46:40,090
You are cruel and unscrupulous but cowardly. When I saw you I knew you deeply.

974
01:46:42,028 --> 01:46:44,053
Disarm and surrender at once.

975
01:46:55,175 --> 01:46:59,236
Forget our enmity totally.

976
01:46:59,346 --> 01:47:01,314
Give me a chance to live.

977
01:47:01,448 --> 01:47:03,245
I will lead all my troops to withdraw.

978
01:47:03,383 --> 01:47:06,147
I will leave all my property to you.

979
01:47:06,253 --> 01:47:09,336
Nan Batian will retreat from military circles

980
01:47:09,337 --> 01:47:11,816
and never return to this county again.

981
01:47:11,958 --> 01:47:16,224
You want to stab me in the back later and choke me to death.

982
01:47:17,063 --> 01:47:19,861
What a great idea. Master.

983
01:47:39,686 --> 01:47:40,482
Rush ahead.

984
01:47:40,587 --> 01:47:42,919
Rush ahead.

985
01:48:03,143 --> 01:48:05,611
I surrender. I surrender.

986
01:48:05,745 --> 01:48:07,838
I beg you not to kill me!

987
01:49:04,037 --> 01:49:05,595
Long Live the Communist Party!

988
01:49:05,705 --> 01:49:10,199
Long Live the Communist Party!

989
01:49:14,347 --> 01:49:19,051
Now let's welcome the Party representative from Company Two of the women's army,

990
01:49:19,052 --> 01:49:20,445
Comrade Qinghua, to speak.

991
01:49:21,988 --> 01:49:23,148
Comrades.

992
01:49:26,660 --> 01:49:33,566
From now on, you 120 persons, have become the glorious fighters of the Red Army.

993
01:49:33,700 --> 01:49:37,830
Now we will learn from the excellent tradition of the women's army

994
01:49:38,939 --> 01:49:42,431
and those martyrs who have sacrificed themselves.

995
01:49:42,509 --> 01:49:48,812
Pick up your guns and beat down the enemy, no matter if he is Nan Batian or Bei Batian.

996
01:49:49,916 --> 01:49:54,615
It's not enough just for us to do so. Our children need to fight, following us too.

997
01:49:55,589 --> 01:49:59,548
We will fight until the entire proletariat is liberated.

998
01:50:04,731 --> 01:50:05,857
Forward march...

999
01:50:05,966 --> 01:50:06,830
forward march.

1000
01:50:06,967 --> 01:50:10,562
The fighter's responsibility is heavy; women's animosity is strong.

1001
01:50:10,670 --> 01:50:13,711
There was Hua Mulan in ancient times who joined the army,

1002
01:50:13,712 --> 01:50:15,232
taking the place of her father.

1003
01:50:15,342 --> 01:50:19,438
The women's army uses guns to protect the people nowadays.

1004
01:50:19,579 --> 01:50:20,739
Forward march...

1005
01:50:20,847 --> 01:50:23,509
forward march.

1006
01:50:23,617 --> 01:50:27,212
The fighter's responsibility is heavy; women's animosity is strong.

1007
01:50:27,320 --> 01:50:42,099
The fighter's responsibility is heavy; women's animosity is strong.

1008
01:50:42,168 --> 01:50:46,332
The End
