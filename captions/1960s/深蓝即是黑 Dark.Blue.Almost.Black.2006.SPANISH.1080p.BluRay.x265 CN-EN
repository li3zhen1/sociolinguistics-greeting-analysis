George, tell me it wasn't you.

5
00:02:35,654 --> 00:02:37,208
Please tell me it's not you

6
00:02:41,713 --> 00:02:42,682
it's me

7
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:45,842
No, it's not you...

8
00:02:47,593 --> 00:02:49,700
I can't be a housekeeper

9
00:02:50,023 --> 00:02:51,128
Can't do it. Really can't do it.

10
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:53,255
i can't live with you

11
00:02:54,236 --> 00:02:55,414
I have already done my best

12
00:02:56,185 --> 00:02:57,395
I swear

13
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:59,074
I want to start a new life

14
00:03:00,085 --> 00:03:01,399
Sorry dad

15
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:06,685
You understand, right?

16
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,898
I can not do anything

17
00:03:13,932 --> 00:03:15,069
I do not want this

18
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,930
dad

19
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:25,788

00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:38,843
dad

25
00:03:40,063 --> 00:03:41,408
Wake up...

26
00:03:42,002 --> 00:03:42,982
dad

27
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,915
seven years later

28
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:51,791
time to go

31
00:05:31,528 --> 00:05:32,665
Go to ward 5

32
00:05:34,281 --> 00:05:35,146
Hello

33
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,525
Don't you want to talk to me?

34
00:05:40,892 --> 00:05:41,955
Why not?

35
00:05:42,456 --> 00:05:43,770
Because you are a bad person

36
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:46,929
Why do you think I'm a bad person?

37
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:49,786
All women here are bad

38
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:57,784
Hey, are you going to make it?

39
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,599
Oh well

40
00:06:10,807 --> 00:06:12,882
- Hi, beauties. - So pretty.

41
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,769
Everyone, be quiet

42
00:06:15,468 --> 00:06:17,449
Please be quiet. Be quiet.

43
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:19,399
Sit here

44
00:06:19,576 --> 00:06:22,173
Find a seat and sit in the front row

45
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:28,408
Please!

46
00:06:29,837 --> 00:06:31,505
please be quiet

47
00:06:32,037 --> 00:06:34,216
quiet quiet

48
00:06:34,956 --> 00:06:36,093
Silent

49
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:41,213
Okay, I guess you can tell
that this is a drama class.

50
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,495
right?

51
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:44,268
Of course we are stupid

52
00:06:44,455 --> 00:06:46,218
No. You are all quite smart.

53
00:06:46,468 --> 00:06:48,272
But I see deeper. You all wear

54
00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:50,295
Flowery and handsome

55
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,017
I know why you are here. You
are not interested in drama.

56
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:55,685
You are here ready to make a move

57
00:06:55,863 --> 00:06:57,176
Either looking for a girlfriend or a boyfriend

58
00:06:57,677 --> 00:07:00,732
If you are really here for this, please leave

59
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,922
Okay, Manrollo, she's right.

60
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:04,632
Get out of here, man.

61
00:07:05,643 --> 00:07:07,103
don't be upset

62
00:07:07,656 --> 00:07:10,440
just kidding

63
00:07:11,211 --> 00:07:12,556
That's funny. Thanks

64
00:07:12,702 --> 00:07:14,892
We quite like drama, right?

65
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,301
Don't pick it up, dad. Don't drop it.

66
00:07:39,563 --> 00:07:40,814
Give you a clean one

67
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,776
What's the main course?  Chicken breast?

68
00:07:46,351 --> 00:07:47,873
Omelette?

69
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,031
dad

70
00:07:51,397 --> 00:07:52,951
What are you doing

71
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,141
Dad, holy shit

72
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:58,071
- My bread...
- Put the money down!

73
00:07:58,352 --> 00:07:59,770
dad look at me

74
00:08:00,156 --> 00:08:02,481
Look at me, dad,
this is the bread

75
00:08:02,909 --> 00:08:04,191
see it

76
00:08:04,681 --> 00:08:05,693

77
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:12,679
Mentally retarded

78
00:08:20,478 --> 00:08:22,251
Look at that guy's tattoo.

79
00:08:24,232 --> 00:08:25,410
Pretty cool, right?

80
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:30,415
- Do you have a tattoo?
- No. I hate needles.

81
00:08:30,634 --> 00:08:34,524
Otherwise I would have a tiger head tattoo right here.

82
00:08:34,774 --> 00:08:36,098
It has to be colored

83
00:08:38,747 --> 00:08:40,801
- I hate tattoos - don't you?

84
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,096
Then I don’t like it very much either.

85
00:08:44,523 --> 00:08:45,733
tiger pair

86
00:08:46,577 --> 00:08:48,194
Do you like tigers?

87
00:08:48,381 --> 00:08:50,435
If you don't like it, then neither do I.

88
00:08:50,748 --> 00:08:52,583
I'll listen to you

89
00:09:02,927 --> 00:09:04,345

00:12:22,251 --> 00:12:24,160

Laugh, Spanish gentry

144
00:13:01,874 --> 00:13:03,929
It took seven years to graduate from college

145
00:13:04,064 --> 00:13:05,138
I've been working part-time

146
00:13:05,732 --> 00:13:06,713
Yeah?

147
00:13:07,265 --> 00:13:08,298
Still doing it

148
00:13:11,134 --> 00:13:13,209
I didn’t write down my work experience.

149
00:13:14,022 --> 00:13:16,097
No contact with the position applied for

150
00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:18,151
What did you do before?

151
00:13:18,328 --> 00:13:19,715
janitor

152
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,592
goalkeeper?

153
00:13:22,614 --> 00:13:24,970
Not a janitor

154
00:13:25,773 --> 00:13:26,806
working in apartment

155
00:13:51,069 --> 00:13:53,666
We're going to use brooms as props

156
00:13:53,853 --> 00:13:58,483
Brooms are used to sweep away trash, but today...

157
00:13:58,827 --> 00:13:59,932
What happened?

158
00:14:00,151 --> 00:14:02,508
Today the broom will be used as a means of transportation

159
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,262
it can make you fly

160
00:14:06,481 --> 00:14:08,556
Let you walk through walls

161
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:10,829
Who will demonstrate?

162
00:14:11,006 --> 00:14:13,081
- Jump! Come on, fly

163
00:14:13,446 --> 00:14:15,104

164
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:17,648
Jump jump jump!

00:14:25,343 --> 00:14:27,324
Okay next volunteer

166
00:14:27,502 --> 00:14:28,398
Fly one for everyone to see

167
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,608
You haven't climaxed yet?

168
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,423
It's hard to concentrate in this place

169
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:33,852
Let's change places

170
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,499
forget it

171
00:14:36,052 --> 00:14:37,126
everyone says so

172
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,120
If you're on top of me, it'll give your clitoris more friction

173
00:14:41,276 --> 00:14:43,038
No, this is better

174
00:14:43,778 --> 00:14:44,790
What's better?

175
00:14:49,065 --> 00:14:50,274
easy to conceive

176
00:15:26,227 --> 00:15:28,688
I told you, don't show my dad porn.

177
00:15:28,865 --> 00:15:31,826
Once you see it, it’s endless

178
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,766
He can't control himself at all

179
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,330
Yeah I'll pay attention

180
00:15:36,383 --> 00:15:38,708
Do you know that pervert across the street?

181
00:15:39,303 --> 00:15:41,221
- Which one?
- The one who rides a motorcycle

182
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,202
His shutters are always closed

183
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,319
Air conditioning is broken

184
00:15:45,674 --> 00:15:46,685
So what happened?

185
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:48,625
You have to open the window

186
00:15:48,802 --> 00:15:51,054
I can see into the room. He's a masseuse.

187
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,027
I strained my back. Damn it.

188
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,112
Made it when I helped my
dad - Let’s make a date

189
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,281
He also placed an advertisement in the newspaper

190
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,182
Did you have an interview today?

191
00:16:05,058 --> 00:16:06,079
Um

192
00:16:06,236 --> 00:16:07,591
how is everything?

193
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,658
Not great. Very bad.

194
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:14,400
How much does he charge for service?

195
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,508
80 euros

196
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:20,177
So damn expensive

197
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,857
including masturbation

198
00:16:27,038 --> 00:16:28,362
He also gave oral sex to a customer

199
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:29,999
100 yuan once

200
00:16:30,385 --> 00:16:31,553
I'll give it to you. Thanks.

201
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:35,984
george

202
00:16:37,444 --> 00:16:39,519
We are like two fishes

203
00:16:40,781 --> 00:16:43,627
Two ordinary fish. The problem
is that you are not satisfied.

204
00:16:43,815 --> 00:16:45,577
Living in a fish tank will not satisfy you

205
00:16:45,901 --> 00:16:47,454
Fish tanks are cool, man.

206
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:48,956
actually very cool

207
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,095
Let's go dad

208
00:16:53,627 --> 00:16:54,764
one two

209
00:16:55,744 --> 00:16:56,818
three

210
00:17:01,906 --> 00:17:03,043
It took so long to get a degree

211
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:05,556
Why?

212
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,851
I can't go to class normally. I
have to take care of my father.

213
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,383
What's up with him?

214
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:13,407
He had a stroke seven years ago

215
00:17:15,472 --> 00:17:18,141
Vascular dementia is insufficient blood supply to the brain

216
00:17:19,267 --> 00:17:21,207
Sometimes he doesn't know anything

217
00:17:21,353 --> 00:17:22,844
Put your hands up, Dad

218
00:17:23,469 --> 00:17:26,358
Raise your arms higher

219
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,927
- Are you the only one taking care of him?
- Yes, I'm handling it well.

220
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,023
You can say that

221
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:47,191
Dad, I just changed it for you

222
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:49,287
What should we do now?

223
00:17:49,464 --> 00:17:50,601
It must not be easy

224
00:17:52,457 --> 00:17:53,698
Are there any other relatives?

225
00:17:54,542 --> 00:17:56,555
I have an older brother but...

226
00:17:56,732 --> 00:17:57,702
But what?

227
00:17:58,682 --> 00:18:00,214
He and my father were at odds

228
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,779
why?

229
00:18:03,176 --> 00:18:04,761
typical family conflict

230
00:18:09,015 --> 00:18:11,559
GEORGE Who the hell could you fool?

231
00:18:11,726 --> 00:18:13,874
You'll never find a decent job

232
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,700
You're so bad, George. You're so bad.

233
00:18:17,336 --> 00:18:18,608
I really should educate you

234
00:18:19,797 --> 00:18:21,121
Wake up, bro.

235
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,508
Learn how to lie

236
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,113
Otherwise it will be difficult for you to move forward

237
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,439
That's right. How capable you are?

238
00:18:29,056 --> 00:18:31,308
I came in because I was stupid, not lying.

239
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:33,331
One idiot per family is enough

240
00:18:33,477 --> 00:18:35,656
Just save it for me

241
00:18:35,844 --> 00:18:38,305
No. 3 five minutes

242
00:18:38,732 --> 00:18:39,900
OK

243
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:43,695
This buy me this thing

244
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,134
What's this?

245
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,939
hormones

246
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,858
synthetic hormones

247
00:18:50,035 --> 00:18:51,213
Want to be a muscular man?

248
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:52,746
Not at all

249
00:18:53,413 --> 00:18:56,437
This thing makes it easier for women to get pregnant

250
00:18:56,573 --> 00:18:57,720
I heard it from a friend

251
00:18:58,074 --> 00:19:00,473
Demetrius, he's an expert

252
00:19:01,275 --> 00:19:03,288
Damn you, you pervert!

253
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:07,459
What do you mean make a woman pregnant?

254
00:19:13,308 --> 00:19:14,935
Is she on point?

255
00:19:15,884 --> 00:19:16,749
Quite on point

256
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:18,949
she is my girlfriend my girlfriend

257
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,349
Met in drama class

258
00:19:23,193 --> 00:19:24,257
when?

259
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,310
about a month ago

260
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:28,480
- You want kids - Don't
you want to be an uncle?

261
00:19:28,657 --> 00:19:29,898
Antonio...

262
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:32,995
Are you out of your mind?

263
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:38,208
Have you ever seen the maternal and child ward?  I haven't seen it either

264
00:19:38,813 --> 00:19:40,398
I heard it's pretty good

265
00:19:40,732 --> 00:19:42,348
Nothing like prison

266
00:19:42,744 --> 00:19:45,841
The room is gorgeous and decorated with little flowers.

267
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,135
Children playing around

268
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:51,232
There is a nursery with doctors and an elegant environment.

269
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,934
Just based on these, I will definitely get her pregnant.

270
00:19:56,518 --> 00:19:58,072
Then he entered the maternal and child ward steadily.

271
00:19:58,437 --> 00:19:59,375
Do you understand?

272
00:19:59,553 --> 00:20:02,128
Time's up on the 5th

273
00:20:02,337 --> 00:20:03,369
Look at her George

274
00:20:04,391 --> 00:20:05,840
Others were violent to her

275
00:20:06,017 --> 00:20:09,354
They tortured her in every possible way. She
had to go to the maternal and child ward.

276
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,139
They were jealous of her
because in a place like this

277
00:20:13,327 --> 00:20:14,390
She is a princess

278
00:20:14,787 --> 00:20:15,861
like poor people

279
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,406
I hate rich people. Who doesn’t want to be rich?

280
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,521
Aren't you the same?

281
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:22,023
- Hate rich people? - no

282
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,024
fart

283
00:20:23,243 --> 00:20:25,078
You just hate the old lady on the third floor

284
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:28,415
She throws garbage into your hands without even looking at you.

285
00:20:30,344 --> 00:20:32,325
Why are you obsessed with her?

286
00:20:32,502 --> 00:20:34,118
You are about to come out

287
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:36,423
Haven't you ever loved?

288
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,539
Don't you want to do something for women?

289
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,771
have you ever thought about

290
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,617
I must have thought about it

291
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,381
But not for me. You
never did anything for me.

292
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,590
now you have to help me

293
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,177
If you can get this thing

294
00:20:52,741 --> 00:20:53,951
I got my wish

295
00:21:06,901 --> 00:21:07,975
What are you going to do?

296
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,863
I'll give you a haircut. It's too long.

297
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:12,542
No, your mother will get it for me.

298
00:21:12,678 --> 00:21:13,783
- Just a little bit. - No.

299
00:21:13,971 --> 00:21:15,326
Dad... damn

300
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,204
Damn it

301
00:21:25,378 --> 00:21:26,410
what are you doing?

302
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:30,279
My dad loves wildlife photography

303
00:21:30,633 --> 00:21:32,510
I carry on the family tradition

304
00:21:33,104 --> 00:21:34,418
Put that camera down

305
00:21:36,306 --> 00:21:37,661
Let's share the money we make

306
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,392
Sean, stop talking nonsense and put it down.

307
00:21:39,955 --> 00:21:42,739
I saw a man go in a few days ago

308
00:21:43,198 --> 00:21:46,420
Married with three beautiful little daughters

309
00:21:47,025 --> 00:21:49,381
Who would have expected that the child’s father is a pervert?

310
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,915
Shouldn't God punish such people?

311
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,668
- I took it away.
- Are you annoyed?

312
00:21:55,544 --> 00:21:57,837
You've been really annoying lately. Stop being so neurotic.

313
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,371
I want you to give me a massage to make you happy

314
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,831
Want to blackmail me?

315
00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:03,750
- Let's go - I won't go

316
00:22:03,927 --> 00:22:06,951
You can't live without me. You can't live without me.

317
00:22:07,128 --> 00:22:08,139
What did you say?

318
00:22:08,317 --> 00:22:12,133
you can't live without me

319
00:22:13,051 --> 00:22:14,396
you need me

320
00:22:15,345 --> 00:22:16,554
If you take it away

321
00:22:16,731 --> 00:22:18,504
I'll never come back

322
00:22:20,767 --> 00:22:21,872
Take Miguel away again

323
00:22:22,748 --> 00:22:25,188
Miguel? That's the name you gave that fish

324
00:22:25,532 --> 00:22:28,003
Miguel is an ordinary fish, just like us.

325
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,757
If you have the guts, just ignore me

326
00:22:32,873 --> 00:22:34,082
Come on man

327
00:22:40,495 --> 00:22:42,403
Aren't you going to ring my doorbell?

328
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,118
Natalie

329
00:22:49,681 --> 00:22:50,692
ocean

330
00:22:55,385 --> 00:22:56,740
When did you come back?

331
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:58,231
last night

332
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:00,942
I'm dirty

333
00:23:01,683 --> 00:23:02,965
I do not care

334
00:23:08,752 --> 00:23:10,410
What's wrong with the hand?

335
00:23:14,206 --> 00:23:15,634
where did you go

336
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,167
- Went abroad - Which country?

337
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:18,408
study

338
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,983
What's the use of studying?

339
00:23:21,171 --> 00:23:22,172
dad...

340
00:23:24,163 --> 00:23:25,435
You take aspirin every day

341
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,666
Is it right?

342
00:23:27,844 --> 00:23:28,783
Yes

343
00:23:29,304 --> 00:23:31,285
When I go there, aspirin is produced.

344
00:23:31,608 --> 00:23:33,621
Bayer Leverkusen, Germany

345
00:23:34,392 --> 00:23:35,810
Worked as a pharmacy intern there

346
00:23:37,176 --> 00:23:39,043
We're going to be late and it's all your fault

347
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,880
You can't have this hair style

348
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,512
You're so annoying

349
00:23:49,699 --> 00:23:51,566
enough of you

350
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,319
Incompetent bungler

351
00:23:54,704 --> 00:23:58,187
You've always been like this and you did it on purpose

352
00:23:58,364 --> 00:24:00,502
- One day I will...
- What's wrong with you?

353
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,077
Are the church bells ringing?

354
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,860
not yet

355
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,896
Go take a shower. It smells bad.

356
00:24:24,276 --> 00:24:25,704
If you get too addicted, you'll die

357
00:24:28,738 --> 00:24:29,948
Baby, try harder, come again

358
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:32,836
Come on, it's almost time for us to go on stage

359
00:24:33,712 --> 00:24:35,328
- Don't stop - Kiss my ear

360
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:49,707
Are you two done?

361
00:24:52,773 --> 00:24:55,442
I've had enough of you two. What should I do next?

362
00:24:56,214 --> 00:24:59,311
If I report it, it will be over for you two.

363
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:01,292
Damn, I mean

364
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:04,253
- Request a private session
- we have already requested it

365
00:25:05,025 --> 00:25:06,234
Can't you just bear it?

366
00:25:07,287 --> 00:25:08,810
He's not that handsome, right?

367
00:25:10,311 --> 00:25:11,521
Antonio

368
00:25:15,003 --> 00:25:16,557
You have braces

369
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:17,787
Braces

370
00:25:19,664 --> 00:25:20,916
Like a yellow-haired girl

371
00:25:22,657 --> 00:25:23,866
Is this it?

372
00:25:24,054 --> 00:25:25,472
It’s been a year and you’ve discovered this

373
00:25:26,213 --> 00:25:27,182
that's it

374
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,329
Yeah

375
00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:31,947
The gap between your teeth is getting bigger and bigger

376
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:33,751
Let me see. Open your mouth.

377
00:25:34,137 --> 00:25:35,076
- No. - Open.

378
00:25:35,222 --> 00:25:36,285
- Don't. - Show me.

379
00:25:36,473 --> 00:25:37,609
Nothing has changed

380
00:25:46,107 --> 00:25:47,317
Difficult

381
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:49,371
What's difficult

382
00:25:49,726 --> 00:25:52,322
- Let's get back to our
old dreams - Where to start?

383
00:25:53,698 --> 00:25:55,043
I can't remember clearly either

384
00:25:56,128 --> 00:25:57,337
So it’s difficult

385
00:25:58,286 --> 00:26:00,361
Isn’t your family planning to sell their house?

386
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:02,280
I will stay here until I sell.

387
00:26:02,457 --> 00:26:05,345
Then I'll take off the "For Sale" sign

388
00:26:07,785 --> 00:26:08,964
I miss you

389
00:26:12,373 --> 00:26:13,447
Me too

390
00:26:24,656 --> 00:26:26,638
Hi, I came to see my brother

391
00:26:31,653 --> 00:26:32,717
George, look at me

392
00:26:33,603 --> 00:26:34,666
you are laughing at me

393
00:26:34,854 --> 00:26:35,793
look at me

394
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,461
I'm not smiling. I'm sad.

395
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:38,983
fart

396
00:26:39,901 --> 00:26:41,913
Are you laughing at your stupid brother?

397
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:44,238
- Look at me.
- I'm not smiling. See?

398
00:26:49,296 --> 00:26:51,402
- I'm sorry - you bastard.

399
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,830
I almost died

400
00:26:53,748 --> 00:26:55,135
How long are you going to stay here?

401
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:56,939
I don’t know. How many days?

402
00:26:58,232 --> 00:26:59,306
Really bad

403
00:26:59,942 --> 00:27:01,704
They approved my "private meeting" with Paula

404
00:27:01,892 --> 00:27:03,508
Our first "private meeting"

405
00:27:03,977 --> 00:27:05,009
There will be more in the future

406
00:27:07,074 --> 00:27:07,971
have a look

407
00:27:08,148 --> 00:27:09,462
what do you think

408
00:27:11,318 --> 00:27:12,454
A bit vulgar

409
00:27:12,642 --> 00:27:14,748
I do it by myself

410
00:27:15,697 --> 00:27:17,397
- Put it on - I don't want it

411
00:27:17,574 --> 00:27:18,929
"I do not want"

412
00:27:19,107 --> 00:27:21,286
Not for you. It's for Paula.

413
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:24,143
help me up

414
00:27:26,552 --> 00:27:28,084
- Give her this. - No, Antonio.

415
00:27:29,617 --> 00:27:31,244
Don't you want to see her?

416
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,506
- I don't know -
"You don't know"

417
00:27:34,591 --> 00:27:36,353
Actually she wants to see you

418
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:38,897
I told her everything about you

419
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,483
You are the hope of the family

420
00:27:41,963 --> 00:27:43,986
If you take the lead, I will take the lead.

421
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:48,011
Tell her you've seen me

422
00:27:48,855 --> 00:27:50,033
She won't worry too much

423
00:27:50,451 --> 00:27:52,077
This private meeting is for our family.

424
00:27:52,265 --> 00:27:54,069
She's our family, George.

425
00:27:54,246 --> 00:27:55,351
she is my person

426
00:27:56,853 --> 00:27:58,313
Don't talk nonsense

427
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,039
you are done

428
00:28:06,946 --> 00:28:08,051
What is accomplished?

429
00:28:08,552 --> 00:28:11,054
Academics I saw your degree certificate in your room

430
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,454
Come and investigate me.

431
00:28:15,538 --> 00:28:17,238
Why didn't you tell me?

432
00:28:18,468 --> 00:28:20,481
You never gave me a chance to surprise you

433
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,297
congratulations

434
00:28:25,527 --> 00:28:26,737
Thanks

435
00:28:59,207 --> 00:29:01,741
Antonio said he made it with his own hands

436
00:29:03,305 --> 00:29:05,150
You look nothing like your brother

437
00:29:06,652 --> 00:29:08,112
Fortunately it's different

438
00:29:10,969 --> 00:29:13,294
- Yeah. Everything is okay.
- Yeah.

439
00:29:14,097 --> 00:29:15,755
He still causes trouble everywhere

440
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:23,095
George, they did some tests on your brother.

441
00:29:23,283 --> 00:29:29,404
He has varicose veins in his
left testicle and is infertile.

442
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:30,509
he never said

443
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:32,918
Operable

444
00:29:34,513 --> 00:29:36,880
But it takes more than a year to wait for diagnosis

445
00:29:38,173 --> 00:29:39,414
The operation only took half an hour?

446
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:42,302
Why didn't he tell me?

447
00:29:43,074 --> 00:29:44,502
You know your brother

448
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:46,066
He feels shameless

449
00:29:46,692 --> 00:29:48,600
He is insecure and feels that he is not a man

450
00:29:48,777 --> 00:29:50,404
I'll talk to him and reassure him

451
00:29:54,178 --> 00:29:55,596
George, I want to ask you something

452
00:29:57,171 --> 00:30:00,226
Actually it was for both of us. It was his idea.

453
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:03,594
My brother's idea

454
00:30:06,701 --> 00:30:07,911
what do you want me to do

455
00:30:11,675 --> 00:30:13,375
can you make me pregnant

456
00:30:16,263 --> 00:30:19,297
He said that if he told you, you wouldn't come.

457
00:30:22,769 --> 00:30:24,052
Paula...

458
00:30:24,719 --> 00:30:26,492
I just started ovulating

459
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:28,932
Paula, I'm really sorry.

460
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,311
have a look

461
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,855
Look how they tortured me

462
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,556
Why do they do that?

463
00:30:42,748 --> 00:30:44,437
- Come on, Paula.
- Your brother said...

464
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:48,337
You like the girl next door very much

465
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,434
please put it on

466
00:30:53,707 --> 00:30:55,782
You can close your eyes and think of me as her

467
00:31:22,193 --> 00:31:24,143
for sale

468
00:31:32,631 --> 00:31:34,612
Why did Dad sell the truck?

469
00:31:34,998 --> 00:31:36,353
Because he wants to sell

470
00:31:36,531 --> 00:31:38,157
Isn't it left to me?

471
00:31:38,408 --> 00:31:39,909
Why didn't I know this?

472
00:31:40,743 --> 00:31:42,328
you want that truck

473
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,103
I'll give it to you if I sell a fish

474
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:49,085
I can't I got a job

475
00:31:50,305 --> 00:31:51,243
Oh, is it so?

476
00:31:51,838 --> 00:31:52,974
Then why don't you work?

477
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,560
I'll start later

478
00:31:55,946 --> 00:31:56,884
What kind of work do you do?

479
00:31:57,062 --> 00:31:59,168
be an idiot

480
00:32:01,274 --> 00:32:02,515
I spy on idiots

481
00:32:04,152 --> 00:32:05,508
- Did you sleep with her? - No.

482
00:32:05,685 --> 00:32:07,040
You slept, you bastard

483
00:32:07,353 --> 00:32:08,709
I didn't sleep with her!

484
00:32:09,866 --> 00:32:12,014
You should sleep with her. Don't you like her?

485
00:32:12,608 --> 00:32:13,818
Paula, I didn't leave you wanting to move.

486
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:17,958
Are you gay and still not in the right state?

487
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:20,126
- Stop talking nonsense to me.
- Is it over?

488
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,198
I knew you had no
idea. I expected it.

489
00:32:31,502 --> 00:32:33,056
But now I feel better

490
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:36,956
Because you have principles

491
00:32:37,769 --> 00:32:39,187
I can trust you now

492
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,210
- trust me?
- mission accomplished

493
00:32:41,387 --> 00:32:42,732
I won't do anything

494
00:32:44,098 --> 00:32:46,205
You know what those perverts do?

495
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,613
They cut off their own dicks

496
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:51,366
Horrible

497
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,328
The doctor has no choice but to
operate on them, and I should do the same.

498
00:32:55,547 --> 00:32:56,653
see that?

499
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:58,769
I'm going to do it myself

500
00:32:58,988 --> 00:33:00,125
Antonio, okay?

501
00:33:12,418 --> 00:33:13,732
You will make mistakes

502
00:33:18,821 --> 00:33:20,103
Paula, I can't wait for another year.

503
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,722
If I don't do it, someone else will take my place

504
00:33:25,817 --> 00:33:27,131
She'll find another man to do it with

505
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,039
She can only have children with you

506
00:33:29,227 --> 00:33:31,656
Will a woman like her still want me after we go out?

507
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:36,901
Can she still give me happiness when I'm out?

508
00:33:37,089 --> 00:33:38,580
Then give up

509
00:33:38,757 --> 00:33:40,811
George, I never asked you for anything.

510
00:33:41,155 --> 00:33:42,292
Say it again

511
00:33:42,761 --> 00:33:44,628
Anyway, I never asked for anything important.

512
00:33:45,295 --> 00:33:46,828
come on man

513
00:33:48,392 --> 00:33:50,091
You do it, I do it

514
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:52,844
Having a baby won't solve any problems

515
00:33:54,137 --> 00:33:56,285
this is my problem

516
00:34:03,219 --> 00:34:04,491
Pay attention to personal hygiene

517
00:34:13,615 --> 00:34:15,805
Apartment for sale Ask the administrator for details

518
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,741
- Hi - here you go

519
00:34:25,304 --> 00:34:26,378
this is for you

520
00:34:27,431 --> 00:34:28,463
It's so kind of you

521
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:31,247
Come in? Some friends came

522
00:34:31,435 --> 00:34:32,676
- From Germany -
Speaking German?

523
00:34:32,853 --> 00:34:33,885
Or English?

524
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:35,981
I still won’t enter

525
00:34:36,336 --> 00:34:37,993
I want you to meet them

526
00:34:39,505 --> 00:34:40,642
Why don't you call me?

527
00:34:41,977 --> 00:34:43,113
Can you still come?

528
00:34:45,762 --> 00:34:47,357
How can I make you change your mind?

529
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,203
Take out the trash

530
00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:53,509
Change my dad's diaper, feed him, put him to bed

531
00:34:54,187 --> 00:34:55,428
He has 90 pounds

532
00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,286
Come back later

533
00:34:59,682 --> 00:35:00,923
I speak Spanish

534
00:35:07,721 --> 00:35:10,943
- What are they celebrating?
- Don't know

535
00:35:13,842 --> 00:35:15,260
I met my brother's girlfriend

536
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:18,013
- where?
- Private meetings in prison

537
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:21,944
- That's for sex - or chatting

538
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:23,612
No one uses private meetings to chat

539
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:24,999
You just know how to make love

540
00:35:27,512 --> 00:35:28,826
she wants a child

541
00:35:29,013 --> 00:35:32,131
- My brother is
infertile - Then I'll do it

542
00:35:32,319 --> 00:35:34,185
- What?
- Damn, you know what you're asking

543
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:35,968
no way

544
00:35:36,281 --> 00:35:37,386
Why?

545
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:40,838
they want me to do

546
00:35:43,069 --> 00:35:45,352
Your brother asked you to make his girlfriend pregnant?

547
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:47,719
No...

548
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:01,400
My dad is gay

549
00:36:02,964 --> 00:36:04,392
Like other comrades

550
00:36:04,643 --> 00:36:05,883
More gay than others

551
00:36:06,624 --> 00:36:07,969
We can make an exchange

552
00:36:08,813 --> 00:36:09,919
OK

553
00:36:22,483 --> 00:36:23,766
You're not kidding me, are you?

554
00:36:24,402 --> 00:36:25,194
No

555
00:36:25,549 --> 00:36:26,373
oh

556
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:28,708
Don't just say "oh", say something else

557
00:36:31,774 --> 00:36:33,161
Masturbation or oral sex?

558
00:36:33,338 --> 00:36:35,111
I don't know. I'm not watching, man.

559
00:36:39,219 --> 00:36:40,918
He also knows the rules!

560
00:36:42,629 --> 00:36:44,015
I still have it

561
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:48,197
masturbating

562
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,573
- what? - some ads

563
00:37:01,418 --> 00:37:04,442
It's a postmark on the ad, pay in advance, not a stamp, right?

564
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,362
That's a discount

565
00:37:07,612 --> 00:37:09,072
Isn't it time for you to work?

566
00:37:09,249 --> 00:37:11,053
your lunch

567
00:37:12,137 --> 00:37:13,722
Made it for him too

568
00:37:14,223 --> 00:37:16,235
No wonder he is idle

569
00:37:17,705 --> 00:37:18,769
mom...

570
00:37:22,502 --> 00:37:23,784
I very love you

571
00:37:30,572 --> 00:37:33,315
Now that he has a job, he is much more docile.

572
00:37:43,867 --> 00:37:46,223
If you accept this job

573
00:37:46,922 --> 00:37:50,019
You just have to quit your current job, right?

574
00:37:50,196 --> 00:37:52,417
- Yes - Did you have
anywhere else to go?

575
00:37:53,053 --> 00:37:54,054
there is none left

576
00:37:54,888 --> 00:37:57,432
You have to work here 50 hours a week

577
00:37:58,058 --> 00:38:01,218
- Who will take care of your father?
- Let me figure it out.

578
00:38:01,395 --> 00:38:02,406
No

579
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:04,731
Your problems are my problems here

580
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:07,547
your father is my father

581
00:38:08,527 --> 00:38:09,914
And your work is great

582
00:38:10,101 --> 00:38:11,968
Have a fixed income and a stable place to live.

583
00:38:12,218 --> 00:38:13,949
Your father will be in good hands

584
00:38:14,137 --> 00:38:15,482
What am I touching, Dad?

585
00:38:16,358 --> 00:38:17,432
my ears

586
00:38:18,235 --> 00:38:20,038
Where are my ears?  where?

587
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:23,031
looking around

588
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,835
here

589
00:38:25,648 --> 00:38:27,598
Where are my eyes?

590
00:38:30,132 --> 00:38:31,112
good

591
00:38:31,769 --> 00:38:34,094
What is this called?  you have two

592
00:38:34,834 --> 00:38:36,002
dad?

593
00:38:36,367 --> 00:38:38,056
- Son... - What?

594
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,882
Why don’t you want to do property cleaning?

595
00:38:41,132 --> 00:38:42,488
Why don’t you want to do property cleaning?

596
00:38:44,261 --> 00:38:45,616
Because I don't want to do it

597
00:38:45,793 --> 00:38:47,493
Because I don't want to do it

598
00:38:50,632 --> 00:38:53,822
We are very sorry to inform you that due to limited positions

599
00:38:54,104 --> 00:38:56,648
Competition is fierce

600
00:38:56,784 --> 00:38:58,931
This position cannot be offered to you at the moment...

601
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:04,155
"Your resume has been collected into our database for future consideration.

602
00:39:04,333 --> 00:39:05,959
Sincerely..."

603
00:39:35,405 --> 00:39:36,792
what are you doing here?

604
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:39,785
It's too hot outside

605
00:39:40,348 --> 00:39:41,881
Give me my first month’s salary

606
00:39:42,121 --> 00:39:44,133
You can pay back the loan, right?

607
00:40:00,212 --> 00:40:03,235
- Why do you always avoid me?
- Me

608
00:40:03,413 --> 00:40:04,591
Well, you've been running away

609
00:40:04,737 --> 00:40:06,364
I'm here 20 hours a day

610
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:08,345
not with me

611
00:40:09,711 --> 00:40:10,951
Why are you so well-dressed?

612
00:40:11,139 --> 00:40:13,537
I'm going to work in a pharmaceutical laboratory

613
00:40:13,715 --> 00:40:15,060
how is everything?

614
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:16,905
Still getting used to it

615
00:40:17,124 --> 00:40:19,272
- Good afternoon - Bye Alfonso

616
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:21,848
I've been doing this my whole life

617
00:40:22,275 --> 00:40:23,245
do what?

618
00:40:24,528 --> 00:40:25,539
escape you

619
00:40:39,636 --> 00:40:41,326
Your brother knows you will come back

620
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:43,202
I haven't decided yet

621
00:40:44,641 --> 00:40:46,226
You have one hour to decide

622
00:40:53,306 --> 00:40:56,601
I went to South America for the summer vacation. I didn’t expect to stay there for two years.

623
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,925
for him?

624
00:40:58,801 --> 00:41:00,261
We met on Margarita Island

625
00:41:01,241 --> 00:41:03,316
I work at a luxury resort

626
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:06,246
Working as a foreign affairs liaison officer, he is engaged in real estate

627
00:41:06,903 --> 00:41:07,935
Um

628
00:41:08,853 --> 00:41:10,177
That's what he told me anyway

629
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:14,317
Things happened suddenly and we got along very well at first.

630
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,862
He goes to Spain twice a month

631
00:41:19,916 --> 00:41:21,512
he is obsessed with me

632
00:41:24,546 --> 00:41:26,006
Five months later I got pregnant

633
00:41:28,164 --> 00:41:30,489
He wants the child to be born in Spain

634
00:41:31,334 --> 00:41:32,502
I agreed

635
00:41:33,138 --> 00:41:35,254
He bought me a plane ticket and I flew back

636
00:41:36,235 --> 00:41:38,080
He was delayed for a few days due to something else

637
00:41:38,706 --> 00:41:39,811
Of course it's about work

638
00:41:40,478 --> 00:41:41,490
What happened?

639
00:41:42,814 --> 00:41:45,171
He never expected a Spanish girl with a big belly

640
00:41:45,348 --> 00:41:47,089
Will be detained by customs

641
00:41:48,069 --> 00:41:49,759
Don't you know what you're holding?

642
00:41:49,915 --> 00:41:50,885
have no idea

643
00:41:54,086 --> 00:41:55,295
I don't want to know either

644
00:41:57,078 --> 00:41:58,392
There's a voice deep inside telling me

645
00:41:58,569 --> 00:42:00,551
Don't think so much

646
00:42:02,751 --> 00:42:05,493
My family still thinks I'm on Margarita Island

647
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:08,308
Did he contact you later?

648
00:42:12,729 --> 00:42:13,981
Why do you still keep this thing?

649
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:16,035
That way I won't forget

650
00:42:16,984 --> 00:42:19,830
It's not his fault that I was imprisoned. I asked for it.

651
00:42:21,082 --> 00:42:22,990
I got on the plane

652
00:42:23,449 --> 00:42:25,357
Carrying luggage

653
00:42:27,901 --> 00:42:29,809
I can't stand the thought of it

654
00:42:35,805 --> 00:42:37,327
Are all your friends gone?

655
00:42:38,901 --> 00:42:40,976
You used to be like this in school

656
00:42:41,821 --> 00:42:43,896
Never socialize with my friends

657
00:42:45,335 --> 00:42:46,920
I don't want to share you with others

658
00:42:48,463 --> 00:42:50,340
Love is not like this

659
00:42:51,112 --> 00:42:53,510
Why are you still with me? You are going abroad.

660
00:42:54,792 --> 00:42:56,325
Choosing a moment that will have no results

661
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,743
I didn't do that

662
00:42:58,275 --> 00:42:59,349
Yes you did that

663
00:43:00,089 --> 00:43:01,851
you make me feel depressed

664
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:04,573
now i'm back

665
00:43:08,952 --> 00:43:10,308
Are you dating anyone now?

666
00:43:10,767 --> 00:43:11,559
No

667
00:43:12,466 --> 00:43:13,572
Have you dated anyone before?

668
00:43:15,042 --> 00:43:16,189
In what sense

669
00:43:16,366 --> 00:43:17,753
any meaning

670
00:43:18,702 --> 00:43:19,703
Yes

671
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:24,322
And you?

672
00:43:27,533 --> 00:43:28,472
No

673
00:43:29,035 --> 00:43:30,839
When I got here, the baby was four months old

674
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,268
I went directly to the maternal and child ward

675
00:43:36,167 --> 00:43:37,377
There are already fetal movements

676
00:43:38,701 --> 00:43:41,245
I stay outside all day in the sun

677
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:45,833
They did an ultrasound on me one day.

678
00:43:48,377 --> 00:43:50,181
Fetus has no heartbeat

679
00:43:53,799 --> 00:43:55,822
They gave me an abortion

680
00:43:57,876 --> 00:43:59,889
They took me out of the delivery room

681
00:44:01,912 --> 00:44:03,569
Don't let me see my daughter

682
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:08,793
I want to see my child

683
00:44:14,883 --> 00:44:16,207
is a girl

684
00:44:18,887 --> 00:44:22,005
- How long do you have left?
- Three years and seven months

685
00:44:24,903 --> 00:44:26,228
I mean now

686
00:44:26,509 --> 00:44:27,969
This private meeting

687
00:44:34,507 --> 00:44:36,206
This is where we had our first kiss

688
00:44:36,394 --> 00:44:37,603
do you remember?

689
00:44:39,866 --> 00:44:41,180
And my dad caught me

690
00:44:42,963 --> 00:44:44,798
I'm particularly afraid of him

691
00:44:46,237 --> 00:44:48,906
Do you know what he said to me afterwards?

692
00:44:51,315 --> 00:44:52,327
He said

693
00:44:52,493 --> 00:44:54,610
"What are you thinking about?

694
00:44:54,798 --> 00:44:56,487
Stop dreaming about swan meat

695
00:44:56,779 --> 00:44:57,790
Do you understand?

696
00:44:58,343 --> 00:44:59,354
Just save it."

697
00:44:59,699 --> 00:45:01,575
We were only 11 years old then

698
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,558
This thing is engraved in my heart

699
00:45:05,861 --> 00:45:07,967
I can't let go

700
00:45:11,116 --> 00:45:12,211
it takes time

701
00:45:47,851 --> 00:45:49,926
I also dated other people

702
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:51,771
Happy for you

703
00:45:51,959 --> 00:45:54,660
I didn't tell you because you wouldn't mind

704
00:45:55,296 --> 00:45:56,849
Why should I mind?

705
00:46:00,238 --> 00:46:03,012
I'd mind if I saw you dating someone else

706
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:07,746
Just date whoever you want to date.

707
00:46:14,012 --> 00:46:17,078
I feel very uncomfortable when you date someone else.

708
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,782
goodbye

709
00:47:04,844 --> 00:47:05,783
What's up

710
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:08,317
Hello I want to have a massage

711
00:47:08,671 --> 00:47:10,162
Please come in

712
00:47:17,023 --> 00:47:20,735
Sorry, the air conditioner is broken.
It will take them several weeks to fix it.

713
00:47:20,923 --> 00:47:22,727
- What's your surname, sir?
- Raymond

714
00:47:24,437 --> 00:47:25,782
Want to take a bath?

715
00:47:26,804 --> 00:47:29,233
- No, that's fine. - Okay.

716
00:47:29,859 --> 00:47:31,913
Take it off, Raymond

717
00:47:32,122 --> 00:47:34,895
Lie face down. I'll
be back in a minute.

718
00:47:38,597 --> 00:47:39,462
What's up?

719
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,641
Oh, Hello

720
00:47:42,246 --> 00:47:44,228
Sorry, I have guests now

721
00:47:44,405 --> 00:47:47,356
Please come back
later. Sorry. Goodbye.

722
00:47:50,943 --> 00:47:52,475
How does it feel?  Okay?

723
00:47:53,132 --> 00:47:54,863
Your back muscles are tight

724
00:47:55,186 --> 00:47:58,252
Yes, I injured my back due to work.

725
00:48:01,276 --> 00:48:02,485
turn around

726
00:48:03,434 --> 00:48:04,446
What to do?

727
00:48:04,613 --> 00:48:06,041
Good to finish

728
00:48:06,531 --> 00:48:08,116
I don't want to masturbate

729
00:48:09,837 --> 00:48:10,900
What about oral sex?

730
00:48:11,265 --> 00:48:13,340
No, I don't want anything

731
00:48:13,695 --> 00:48:14,842
It's all included in the price

732
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:16,750
I do not need

733
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:20,159
looks like you want

734
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,215
Note I need to say this first

735
00:48:34,403 --> 00:48:36,905
You want to hear my statement and decide whether I should be released on parole.

736
00:48:37,395 --> 00:48:39,648
No one thinks so, right?

737
00:48:39,929 --> 00:48:42,525
The key is whether you believe it

738
00:48:42,713 --> 00:48:44,100
my good intentions

739
00:48:44,277 --> 00:48:45,831
If you say so

740
00:48:46,644 --> 00:48:48,761
No matter how extravagant my words are, they won't impress you.

741
00:48:48,938 --> 00:48:50,711
I think the key is

742
00:48:50,888 --> 00:48:52,244
My transformation results

743
00:48:53,537 --> 00:48:56,758
That's it. I'll just sit quietly for a while.

744
00:48:57,572 --> 00:49:01,211
It doesn't matter how long you look at me

745
00:49:02,473 --> 00:49:05,319
See if I'm a changed person

746
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,502
This suit is so fucking handsome. Come and take a look.

747
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:22,847
Charming and lucky

748
00:49:23,452 --> 00:49:25,506
I just don't understand why you don't like it

749
00:49:25,683 --> 00:49:28,008
- Look at this thing they put on me.
- What is it?

750
00:49:28,363 --> 00:49:29,990
Micro surveillance chip

751
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:33,013
With this thing, they can monitor my whereabouts.

752
00:49:33,264 --> 00:49:35,380
or whether doing this

753
00:49:36,298 --> 00:49:37,758
Do that

754
00:49:39,113 --> 00:49:40,250
Incredible, right?

755
00:49:47,392 --> 00:49:48,456
Did you kiss?

756
00:49:49,342 --> 00:49:51,876
How long have you been doing this? It
didn't take long, I guess. So many times...

757
00:49:52,053 --> 00:49:55,421
You don't want to hear all the details, do you?

758
00:49:58,174 --> 00:49:59,634
Did she take off her clothes?

759
00:49:59,811 --> 00:50:02,241
It's enough to take off your underwear

760
00:50:04,336 --> 00:50:07,006
- Did she orgasm?
- No. We didn't kiss either. Damn it.

761
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,727
Are you satisfied?

762
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,272
If she cums, I have to kill her

763
00:50:16,891 --> 00:50:19,216
- What’s wrong with you?
- Difficulty breathing

764
00:50:20,029 --> 00:50:21,239
look at me

765
00:50:21,625 --> 00:50:23,397
Don’t you want to squat in a large size?

766
00:50:24,482 --> 00:50:27,287
- I have to get off.
- Antonio, we have to take...

767
00:50:27,443 --> 00:50:28,611
- Parking - Antonio!

768
00:50:29,174 --> 00:50:30,602
- Stop the car. I can't catch my breath.
- No way.

769
00:50:30,957 --> 00:50:32,375
I just got out of jail, damn

770
00:50:32,521 --> 00:50:34,460
- No. - Open the door!

771
00:50:35,753 --> 00:50:36,932
breathe slowly

772
00:50:38,256 --> 00:50:39,330
So unhappy

773
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:42,083
This is the price of getting to the bottom of things

774
00:50:42,437 --> 00:50:43,605
Not at all

775
00:50:44,867 --> 00:50:46,295
I suddenly discovered...

776
00:50:46,816 --> 00:50:48,370
I'm out now

777
00:50:48,558 --> 00:50:49,913
become free...

778
00:50:50,091 --> 00:50:51,957
What the hell am I going to do?

779
00:50:52,176 --> 00:50:53,417
at a loss

780
00:50:54,157 --> 00:50:57,077
Go home and help me take care of daddy

781
00:50:58,537 --> 00:51:00,486
I can't go home you know

782
00:51:01,008 --> 00:51:02,217
Why not?

783
00:51:02,436 --> 00:51:03,573
Dad won't even notice

784
00:51:04,563 --> 00:51:06,545
Sometimes he doesn't even recognize me

785
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,691
Yeah?

786
00:51:10,788 --> 00:51:11,894
that's not bad

787
00:51:19,558 --> 00:51:21,288
Dad, what do you think?

788
00:51:21,851 --> 00:51:23,760
How did you learn today?  Is there a lot of homework?

789
00:51:24,427 --> 00:51:25,491
yes a lot

790
00:51:25,855 --> 00:51:28,003
Go ahead and do it. I don’t want a stupid son.

791
00:51:29,505 --> 00:51:31,163
Look who this is, Dad. Look.

792
00:51:36,429 --> 00:51:38,086
Do you have homework too?

793
00:51:39,035 --> 00:51:40,214
He said "homework"?

794
00:51:40,537 --> 00:51:42,549
Homework Look at this face

795
00:51:45,062 --> 00:51:46,303
come look at me

796
00:51:47,596 --> 00:51:48,983
Do you still remember my name?

797
00:51:50,484 --> 00:51:51,798
- George - You know George?

798
00:51:54,593 --> 00:51:55,906
How many sons do you have in total?

799
00:51:58,075 --> 00:51:58,972
one

800
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:01,777
one? Did you kill me?

801
00:52:02,006 --> 00:52:03,101
You killed me

802
00:52:04,092 --> 00:52:06,552
I no longer exist. Goodbye...

803
00:52:08,648 --> 00:52:10,452
Can you take me to mass?

804
00:52:11,537 --> 00:52:12,506
sure

805
00:52:13,904 --> 00:52:15,071
Let's go then

806
00:52:16,375 --> 00:52:17,897
- No. - Let's go.

807
00:52:18,074 --> 00:52:20,504
Listen, Dad, the
church bells are ringing

808
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:23,496
He can't stand it as soon as he goes out

809
00:52:24,758 --> 00:52:26,416
Listen, Dad, "Danglang,
Danglang, Danglang..."

810
00:52:26,979 --> 00:52:30,420
- Antonio No, I've tried it
all - "Dang rang, ding rang..."

811
00:52:30,879 --> 00:52:33,579
"Danglang, Danglang..."

812
00:52:33,767 --> 00:52:35,081
"Danglang..."

813
00:52:44,966 --> 00:52:47,604
My brother is with my dad and I'm here with you.

814
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:50,357
Do you want to change it?

815
00:52:51,024 --> 00:52:52,963
Neither hope

816
00:52:54,256 --> 00:52:57,447
You really make your woman feel good after sex

817
00:53:02,744 --> 00:53:04,798
What is it about my brother that attracts you?

818
00:53:05,987 --> 00:53:07,603
he sits next to me

819
00:53:08,416 --> 00:53:09,876
make me laugh

820
00:53:10,606 --> 00:53:14,214
He has beautiful eyes and he is the only one here

821
00:53:14,402 --> 00:53:15,371
People without tattoos

822
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:17,665
He said if he were outside you would never notice him

823
00:53:18,791 --> 00:53:20,866
- Maybe - and he said
you were going to dump him.

824
00:53:21,044 --> 00:53:23,442
As soon as you go out and give birth to a baby

825
00:53:23,588 --> 00:53:25,079
Maybe it will be different

826
00:53:26,163 --> 00:53:27,581
I never lied to your brother

827
00:53:32,701 --> 00:53:34,359
Why are you lying like that?

828
00:53:36,215 --> 00:53:38,853
This makes it easier to get pregnant

829
00:53:40,636 --> 00:53:41,700
Nonsense

830
00:53:43,003 --> 00:53:45,078
You never do anything just because it's possible?

831
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:52,189
Tell us about Natalie

832
00:53:53,336 --> 00:53:55,067
It's her birthday soon

833
00:53:55,286 --> 00:53:56,600
What gift are you going to give her?

834
00:53:57,893 --> 00:53:59,968
I always give her the same gift

835
00:54:01,376 --> 00:54:03,972
Will the rich girl come?  That shy look

836
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,266
Really coquettish

837
00:54:06,485 --> 00:54:08,143
What the hell is wrong with you?

838
00:54:08,403 --> 00:54:11,876
It's nothing, just a casual chat. When
was the last time you slept with a woman?

839
00:54:12,606 --> 00:54:13,638
not long ago

840
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:16,495
Not so long ago?  When exactly?

841
00:54:18,904 --> 00:54:20,436
- Hi - Hi

842
00:54:20,645 --> 00:54:22,136
Natalie, the housekeeper
is here. Is there any trash?

843
00:54:22,981 --> 00:54:24,889
That's a fucking strong opening.

844
00:54:25,306 --> 00:54:26,932
She was joking. Please come in.

845
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,090
Happy birthday

846
00:54:28,507 --> 00:54:29,445
Thanks

847
00:54:30,175 --> 00:54:31,499
We bought it

848
00:54:32,229 --> 00:54:34,826
It's the three of us,
isn't it the three of us?

849
00:55:01,144 --> 00:55:03,917
My dad is a pervert, so I am too

850
00:55:04,272 --> 00:55:06,941
Well, if he's gay, then I have to be too.

851
00:55:07,129 --> 00:55:10,048
Bullshit, getting a massage doesn't mean anything.

852
00:55:10,257 --> 00:55:12,207
He may have accidentally gone to the wrong place.

853
00:55:12,384 --> 00:55:14,782
Impossible. He went there many times later.

854
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,983
It's incredible. I threatened him and he still followed through.

855
00:55:18,474 --> 00:55:21,529
- He didn't take the bait.
Holy shit - Give him hell.

856
00:55:21,706 --> 00:55:24,031
I went there first that day

857
00:55:26,471 --> 00:55:27,931
Suddenly at a loss

858
00:55:28,317 --> 00:55:30,986
- Did you have a massage?
- I have no choice

859
00:55:31,174 --> 00:55:32,519
There is no choice

860
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:33,770
Is the massage comfortable?

861
00:55:34,271 --> 00:55:35,855
It's quite nice. Massage.

862
00:55:36,043 --> 00:55:38,149
His techniques are very skillful

863
00:55:38,441 --> 00:55:41,434
He is very professional. Maybe my dad went there just for the massage.

864
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:45,083
He often strains his lumbar muscles while working. You shouldn't think the worst.

865
00:55:45,261 --> 00:55:47,544
Carrying water is very physically
demanding - what about masturbation?

866
00:55:47,732 --> 00:55:49,390
So what if he masturbates your dad?

867
00:55:49,953 --> 00:55:51,757
Did you really masturbate for your dad?

868
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:54,332
Is there something wrong with your brain?

869
00:55:54,864 --> 00:55:56,418
I? Ask this?

870
00:55:56,814 --> 00:55:59,139
It's unbearable that you can think of such a thing

871
00:56:01,683 --> 00:56:02,789
Wonderful

872
00:56:02,966 --> 00:56:04,989
Quite on point, isn’t it?

873
00:56:05,166 --> 00:56:06,960
Masturbation or oral sex?

874
00:56:10,098 --> 00:56:12,152
Masturbation, don’t ask

875
00:56:15,562 --> 00:56:17,053
Natalie asked a question

876
00:56:19,013 --> 00:56:20,848
My brother’s JJ, are you too?

877
00:56:21,161 --> 00:56:23,664
love at first sight?

878
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:34,206
You're the same old person and don't fit in with others

879
00:56:34,383 --> 00:56:35,665
Learn from your brother

880
00:56:35,843 --> 00:56:38,804
You're wrong. I'm not out of place.

881
00:56:39,534 --> 00:56:40,545
I've been staring at you

882
00:56:40,681 --> 00:56:41,932
Yeah?

883
00:56:42,558 --> 00:56:45,477
Your mother called me and asked me to look at you

884
00:56:45,967 --> 00:56:48,366
If you find something happens, call her

885
00:56:49,241 --> 00:56:50,253
oh

886
00:56:50,461 --> 00:56:52,338
Then I have to bribe you

887
00:56:55,258 --> 00:56:56,363
what?

888
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:58,584
Gongziluo works in human resources

889
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:02,213
I told him everything about you and he's waiting for your call to arrange an interview.

890
00:57:02,953 --> 00:57:04,819
Are we working together in the same company?

891
00:57:05,529 --> 00:57:06,696
Is it not good?

892
00:57:07,854 --> 00:57:10,669
It is forbidden to have personal relationships in the workplace.

893
00:57:10,815 --> 00:57:12,025
this is too bad

894
00:57:13,078 --> 00:57:16,060
I know the reason. It affects production efficiency.

895
00:57:16,279 --> 00:57:17,488
waste time

896
00:57:18,229 --> 00:57:19,365
indeed

897
00:57:19,928 --> 00:57:23,046
Does Gongziluo support or oppose this principle?

898
00:57:23,234 --> 00:57:24,965
You haven't thought about how my job came about, have you?

899
00:57:28,593 --> 00:57:29,605
What's wrong?

900
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:30,908
me?  nothing

901
00:57:31,721 --> 00:57:34,391
you look indifferent

902
00:57:35,725 --> 00:57:36,664
Have you drunk too much?

903
00:57:36,841 --> 00:57:38,457
No, not only that

904
00:57:42,889 --> 00:57:45,078
Playing well. So cool.

905
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,465
Thank you so much

906
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:50,469
hey listen

907
00:57:51,658 --> 00:57:53,462
I suspect I'm gay

908
00:57:54,025 --> 00:57:55,933
Will you go to bed with me?

909
00:57:56,361 --> 00:57:57,914
I just want to confirm it

910
00:57:58,999 --> 00:58:01,021
Why don't you try it with a man?

911
00:58:01,188 --> 00:58:02,168
no

912
00:58:43,084 --> 00:58:44,398
Why are you wearing this outfit?

913
00:58:46,661 --> 00:58:47,985
Where have all the people gone?

914
00:58:48,757 --> 00:58:49,779
all gone

915
00:58:49,935 --> 00:58:51,218
Where have you been?

916
00:58:51,958 --> 00:58:53,053
Where is the bathroom?

917
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:54,419
Stayed for two hours?

918
00:58:56,514 --> 00:58:58,558
I thought you left without saying goodbye

919
00:58:58,735 --> 00:59:00,049
I will not

920
00:59:01,102 --> 00:59:03,157
- You're so handsome
- aren't you?

921
00:59:04,585 --> 00:59:06,764
george man

922
00:59:08,829 --> 00:59:10,111
i cum

923
00:59:10,601 --> 00:59:11,665
I'm a normal man

924
00:59:12,791 --> 00:59:16,430
Hey, come back quickly. I'm not happy enough yet.

925
00:59:16,764 --> 00:59:17,932
that's too bad

926
00:59:20,486 --> 00:59:21,904
Mentally retarded

927
00:59:24,449 --> 00:59:26,180
they ruined the atmosphere

928
00:59:26,889 --> 00:59:28,620
I'm used to him

929
00:59:34,438 --> 00:59:36,972
If something happens between
us, it will be this suit's fault.

930
00:59:38,848 --> 00:59:39,995
Then take it off

931
01:00:11,068 --> 01:00:12,653
God, what are you doing?

932
01:00:14,655 --> 01:00:16,490
At least wait until I finish washing

933
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:23,059
Shaving your nose?  you've never shaved before

934
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:26,229
go out

935
01:00:26,417 --> 01:00:27,866
Here's another one...

936
01:00:28,221 --> 01:00:29,952
- go out!
- Okay, don't be angry.

937
01:00:30,098 --> 01:00:31,067
go out!

938
01:00:31,245 --> 01:00:32,392
Get out!

939
01:00:35,697 --> 01:00:39,107
Next time we have a private meeting, I should come with my brother

940
01:00:39,597 --> 01:00:42,412
Let the three of us chat and then I'll leave

941
01:00:43,882 --> 01:00:45,863
- No. I'd be embarrassed. - Why?

942
01:00:46,552 --> 01:00:47,730
It shouldn't be like this

943
01:00:47,918 --> 01:00:48,846
Too dramatic

944
01:00:51,431 --> 01:00:52,672
i want to touch you

945
01:00:57,417 --> 01:00:58,553
Antonio, don't do this

946
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:00,086
You weren't like this before

947
01:01:00,576 --> 01:01:01,681
Oh, I am

948
01:01:02,213 --> 01:01:03,569
I feel a little uncomfortable.
Please be considerate to me.

949
01:01:03,954 --> 01:01:04,893
All right

950
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,586
- Do you miss me? - certainly

951
01:01:11,118 --> 01:01:12,192
Especially in drama class

952
01:01:12,546 --> 01:01:13,756
what's up?  Be careful

953
01:01:13,933 --> 01:01:14,840
Those bad guys...

954
01:01:15,091 --> 01:01:16,675
Time's up on the 5th

955
01:01:16,894 --> 01:01:18,427
Don't let others do whatever they want to you

956
01:01:18,813 --> 01:01:21,024
Tell them who your boyfriend is!

957
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:22,973
tell them! I'll
show them the color

958
01:01:23,787 --> 01:01:26,414
No. 5 Please exit the chat room

959
01:01:41,356 --> 01:01:42,524
Don't you want to take it away?

960
01:01:44,203 --> 01:01:45,068
It's your father's

961
01:01:45,496 --> 01:01:46,601
He doesn't wear it

962
01:01:47,613 --> 01:01:49,729
I still remember that my mother used to get

963
01:01:49,917 --> 01:01:51,471
collect old clothes

964
01:01:51,648 --> 01:01:53,243
- To clothe the poor? - Yes

965
01:01:55,579 --> 01:01:58,499
She always picks out clothes that fit her first and gives them to us to wear.

966
01:01:59,937 --> 01:02:02,221
She always picks up clothes thrown away by neighbors

967
01:02:03,274 --> 01:02:04,807
Others laugh at us

968
01:02:04,974 --> 01:02:08,039
I never laughed at you
and you wore my shirt

969
01:02:08,978 --> 01:02:10,041
Quite handsome, right?

970
01:02:14,202 --> 01:02:17,111
Take it away. Otherwise, don’t come
to celebrate my birthday in the future.

971
01:02:27,767 --> 01:02:29,227
I see Paula

972
01:02:29,926 --> 01:02:31,907
Is she okay?  What's the news?

973
01:02:32,084 --> 01:02:34,816
Nothing. Maybe you have some problems too.

974
01:02:35,702 --> 01:02:38,236
Come here and let me see

975
01:02:39,383 --> 01:02:42,271
I've booked a private meeting for you next week

976
01:02:44,013 --> 01:02:47,005
Why don't you go? You
should go see her more often?

977
01:02:47,631 --> 01:02:48,987
What are you going to do?

978
01:02:49,508 --> 01:02:50,968
- What am I going to do?
- Stay with her

979
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:54,304
Go touch her, kiss her, sleep with her

980
01:02:54,836 --> 01:02:57,088
What do you want from me?  Want to embarrass me?

981
01:02:57,996 --> 01:02:59,497
Make me even more embarrassed?

982
01:02:59,945 --> 01:03:01,405
Didn't I make it clear?

983
01:03:02,031 --> 01:03:03,699
- Dad What is this? - my money

984
01:03:03,876 --> 01:03:05,649
- Where did you get it?
- in the drawer

985
01:03:05,826 --> 01:03:08,329
His account is empty and
his pension is with me.

986
01:03:08,579 --> 01:03:09,611
You thief

987
01:03:09,862 --> 01:03:13,751
Do you know how much work Paula had to do for each private meeting?

988
01:03:14,731 --> 01:03:17,651
- I can't be with two
women - What two women?

989
01:03:18,287 --> 01:03:19,903
- Natalie...
- There is no other one.

990
01:03:20,091 --> 01:03:21,477
You and Paula have nothing.

991
01:03:21,832 --> 01:03:23,563
You just slept with her, got it?

992
01:03:23,917 --> 01:03:25,648
Do you understand? Who
are you in love with?

993
01:03:26,566 --> 01:03:29,235
- Natalie - Correct.
Don't talk nonsense.

994
01:03:36,232 --> 01:03:38,557
If we continue I feel like I'm cheating on her

995
01:03:39,370 --> 01:03:40,684
Are you going to confess to her?

996
01:03:41,696 --> 01:03:42,874
i should do this

997
01:03:48,348 --> 01:03:50,256
but i don't want to

998
01:03:51,163 --> 01:03:52,967
Don't want to know this

999
01:03:59,442 --> 01:04:01,246
Don't be nervous. We won't do anything.

1000
01:04:01,841 --> 01:04:04,937
- We're all here...
- No need, George.

1001
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:08,962
I understand you. It's really okay.

1002
01:04:10,996 --> 01:04:12,028
Are you disappointed?

1003
01:04:14,437 --> 01:04:15,448
Yes

1004
01:04:16,074 --> 01:04:19,546
I thought you and I could have a
future, but you never took it seriously

1005
01:04:23,414 --> 01:04:24,478
If I don't come again

1006
01:04:24,697 --> 01:04:27,439
Will you find someone else?  Or are you waiting for my brother?

1007
01:04:30,473 --> 01:04:32,006
You have no choice here

1008
01:04:49,857 --> 01:04:51,870
Here we are

1009
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,580
This is not a church

1010
01:04:53,788 --> 01:04:56,562
Dad, God is everywhere.

1011
01:04:57,198 --> 01:04:58,585
- Hello

1012
01:04:59,075 --> 01:05:02,443
- I want to reopen his account
- I just changed it not long ago

1013
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:07,135
Yeah, but we can't find him. He's
always hiding things here and there.

1014
01:05:07,563 --> 01:05:10,513
Okay let me see...

1015
01:05:10,691 --> 01:05:12,568
Let's open a new account for him

1016
01:05:12,745 --> 01:05:14,997
Dad, let’s go to mass right now

1017
01:05:16,405 --> 01:05:17,823
we are quite religious

1018
01:05:18,626 --> 01:05:19,731
yes

1019
01:05:22,108 --> 01:05:24,121
- The account is empty - right?

1020
01:05:24,298 --> 01:05:26,769
Oh, Dad, don't be so distracted!

1021
01:05:27,186 --> 01:05:29,543
Didn’t I tell you that
this account book is not it?

1022
01:05:30,106 --> 01:05:31,180
Remember?

1023
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:33,338
Could you please check other accounts?

1024
01:05:33,901 --> 01:05:35,184
Can I see your ID card first?

1025
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:36,988
- Okay - No, it's his.

1026
01:05:37,832 --> 01:05:39,073
Dad, where is your ID card?

1027
01:05:39,438 --> 01:05:40,825
Do not touch me

1028
01:05:43,995 --> 01:05:45,684
dad...

1029
01:05:47,259 --> 01:05:48,989
I want to see your ID card

1030
01:05:50,011 --> 01:05:51,846
You do it for my money

1031
01:05:53,077 --> 01:05:54,422
Did you hear that?

1032
01:05:54,599 --> 01:05:57,237
I keep saying that I need to go to the bank first and then go to church.

1033
01:05:57,425 --> 01:05:58,249
Now you've changed your mind?

1034
01:06:00,376 --> 01:06:02,493
- Then let's go.
- Yeah, let's go.

1035
01:06:02,712 --> 01:06:04,724
- Dad, stop inking.
- Don't touch me.

1036
01:06:05,808 --> 01:06:07,498
- Dad... - Don't touch me.

1037
01:06:09,041 --> 01:06:09,979
you saw it

1038
01:06:10,156 --> 01:06:12,336
He treats me like this every day

1039
01:06:12,763 --> 01:06:14,880
He doesn't care how many people are waiting for him

1040
01:06:17,362 --> 01:06:19,791
Don't let him fall into the hands of the person who hates him the most.

1041
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:29,561
- You got it. - Retarded.

1042
01:06:31,688 --> 01:06:33,148
Okay, now you yell as hard as you can

1043
01:06:37,569 --> 01:06:42,720
Before taking a drama class, I
took a dance class and met a man.

1044
01:06:43,064 --> 01:06:44,243
His name is Juan

1045
01:06:45,431 --> 01:06:48,549
There was a female prisoner who chased him for a long time

1046
01:06:49,571 --> 01:06:51,969
They dated a few times together,
but he was always erratic.

1047
01:06:53,992 --> 01:06:56,985
She treats him like property

1048
01:06:58,788 --> 01:06:59,998
She found out about us

1049
01:07:00,186 --> 01:07:02,365
jealous

1050
01:07:03,074 --> 01:07:04,138
Is that the person who bullied you?

1051
01:07:04,294 --> 01:07:05,848
Yeah, and her colleagues

1052
01:07:08,851 --> 01:07:10,196
Did you also let him make you pregnant?

1053
01:07:10,342 --> 01:07:12,531
- Yes

1054
01:07:13,689 --> 01:07:14,930
He doesn't want any baggage

1055
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:17,995
Does my brother know?

1056
01:07:19,392 --> 01:07:20,289
have no idea

1057
01:07:21,134 --> 01:07:22,938
So you cheated on him too

1058
01:07:33,479 --> 01:07:35,773
Your car is very
beautiful. 600 yuan?

1059
01:07:36,712 --> 01:07:37,859
750

1060
01:07:38,349 --> 01:07:39,809
Quite generous

1061
01:07:40,372 --> 01:07:41,957
How about you also be a masseuse?

1062
01:07:42,874 --> 01:07:43,979
This is it

1063
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:46,659
I really can't imagine myself masturbating to someone else

1064
01:07:51,331 --> 01:07:52,957
How did you choose this line of work?

1065
01:07:53,385 --> 01:07:56,231
Because I'm good at it, right?

1066
01:07:56,482 --> 01:07:57,305
That is

1067
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:01,268
Turn around Raymond

1068
01:08:07,889 --> 01:08:08,858
Hey

1069
01:08:10,047 --> 01:08:12,122
- My name is not Raymond - No?

1070
01:08:12,414 --> 01:08:14,041
my name is israel

1071
01:08:14,948 --> 01:08:16,230
better

1072
01:08:17,357 --> 01:08:21,173
My buddies all call me Sean.
They think I look like Sean Penn.

1073
01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:25,344
Isn't it? It's very similar

1074
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,815
Thanks

1075
01:08:30,682 --> 01:08:31,923
Robert

1076
01:08:33,216 --> 01:08:34,707
Can I touch you?

1077
01:08:36,417 --> 01:08:37,429
Can't

1078
01:08:55,833 --> 01:08:57,188
- George? -Hi

1079
01:08:57,751 --> 01:09:00,254
Come with me. Sorry
to keep you waiting.

1080
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:02,714
- It's okay - Natalie
told me a lot about you.

1081
01:09:02,996 --> 01:09:05,248
- We're old friends.
- Yeah, she told me.

1082
01:09:05,436 --> 01:09:08,251
One thing. Are you two still together?

1083
01:09:09,158 --> 01:09:10,295
What did she say?

1084
01:09:10,754 --> 01:09:12,453
leave her

1085
01:09:18,897 --> 01:09:19,930
This way

1086
01:09:20,149 --> 01:09:21,702
I brought my resume

1087
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:23,026
Okay I'll take a look

1088
01:09:23,214 --> 01:09:27,145
I have to go to a meeting. Emilio will tell you about the situation.

1089
01:09:27,489 --> 01:09:29,856
Emilio, this is George

1090
01:09:30,065 --> 01:09:33,255
Treat him well. He was
recommended. See you later.

1091
01:09:37,551 --> 01:09:38,479
Hi

1092
01:09:41,378 --> 01:09:45,684
I work here until 11pm. You take over my
shift and work until 7am the next morning.

1093
01:09:45,935 --> 01:09:47,217
The suit is nice

1094
01:09:47,634 --> 01:09:49,438
These cars need to be labeled, did you see that?

1095
01:09:49,793 --> 01:09:53,401
Parking spaces are designated. These guys can park wherever they catch them.

1096
01:09:54,558 --> 01:09:56,612
There are cameras on every floor

1097
01:09:57,592 --> 01:09:59,803
But you have to check every hour

1098
01:10:00,929 --> 01:10:02,556
open your eyes

1099
01:10:03,504 --> 01:10:05,381
Be careful not to stain your suit

1100
01:10:05,871 --> 01:10:08,572
Look, that's Gongziluo's car

1101
01:10:10,115 --> 01:10:11,127
Pretty cool, right?

1102
01:10:12,065 --> 01:10:14,046
This bastard

1103
01:10:37,184 --> 01:10:38,915
If you want that, pay for it yourself

1104
01:10:45,432 --> 01:10:46,641
No need to look for it, Dad

1105
01:10:57,882 --> 01:11:00,906
Was the interview unsuccessful?
Make you not want to see me

1106
01:11:01,917 --> 01:11:03,345
quite successful

1107
01:11:04,597 --> 01:11:07,131
From now on, I will only park the car for you, no need to take out the trash for you.

1108
01:11:08,079 --> 01:11:11,343
Although I can do both, he
asked me to work the night shift

1109
01:11:12,907 --> 01:11:14,993
Sorry, I didn't know
that was the case

1110
01:11:16,849 --> 01:11:18,715
That's right. You
don't know anything.

1111
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,203
GEORGE What are you doing?

1112
01:11:37,546 --> 01:11:39,423
Why did you tell him I was a cleaner?

1113
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:43,938
- He asked me - You should shut
up and let me tell him myself!

1114
01:11:44,439 --> 01:11:47,285
- I said you are my
friend - Childhood playmate

1115
01:11:47,463 --> 01:11:49,047
my best friend

1116
01:11:49,235 --> 01:11:51,769
Did you tell me that I slept
with you on your birthday?

1117
01:11:52,853 --> 01:11:53,886
I said a lot of nice things

1118
01:11:55,325 --> 01:11:56,743
No wonder you let me do this bullshit job

1119
01:11:56,993 --> 01:11:58,056
you didn't tell him

1120
01:11:58,807 --> 01:12:01,091
you are interested in finance

1121
01:12:02,008 --> 01:12:03,843
You didn't say anything, right?

1122
01:12:04,824 --> 01:12:06,377
I don't want to embarrass you

1123
01:12:06,732 --> 01:12:09,099
Leave me alone,
George. I don't care.

1124
01:12:10,006 --> 01:12:11,539
Of course you don't have to care

1125
01:12:12,237 --> 01:12:15,219
You have a good job, a master's degree, and experience in Germany

1126
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:17,128
Good jobs are yours to choose

1127
01:12:17,315 --> 01:12:19,390
If you don’t like your teeth, wear braces

1128
01:12:19,578 --> 01:12:23,123
Stop complaining. I signed
a three-month contract.

1129
01:12:23,467 --> 01:12:25,615
The wages are so low that
I am also being exploited.

1130
01:12:27,961 --> 01:12:30,214
Do you think you are the only one who is pitiful?

1131
01:12:32,163 --> 01:12:33,310
you are wrong

1132
01:12:34,781 --> 01:12:37,450
You are the only one who makes me feel useful

1133
01:12:37,596 --> 01:12:38,566
Um

1134
01:12:39,890 --> 01:12:42,142
But you have to face your own problems yourself

1135
01:12:43,268 --> 01:12:45,865
You can make life easier

1136
01:12:46,052 --> 01:12:46,991
Make it easier for both of us

1137
01:12:49,566 --> 01:12:52,163
You blame your father and your brother

1138
01:12:53,007 --> 01:12:54,071
And I

1139
01:12:55,510 --> 01:12:57,877
In fact, you are torturing yourself

1140
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,405
Stay away from me, don't let me see you

1141
01:13:49,407 --> 01:13:52,150
This beast, I need
to give him some color.

1142
01:13:56,613 --> 01:13:59,417
I want the neighbors to know
about his scandal, let everyone know

1143
01:13:59,876 --> 01:14:01,784
Sean, forget it.

1144
01:14:02,837 --> 01:14:04,183
So what if your dad likes it?

1145
01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:06,278
it's part of him

1146
01:14:06,727 --> 01:14:07,978
Can't you stand it?

1147
01:14:11,919 --> 01:14:12,983
I realized I fell in love with Robert

1148
01:14:13,932 --> 01:14:15,006
Robert?

1149
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,633
that masseuse

1150
01:14:19,813 --> 01:14:21,867
I can't stand my dad going to his place

1151
01:14:23,817 --> 01:14:24,849
I can't stand it

1152
01:14:25,725 --> 01:14:27,571
Have you liked anyone before?

1153
01:14:27,748 --> 01:14:28,780
other men

1154
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:31,877
Yes, when I was 15 years old

1155
01:14:32,065 --> 01:14:33,337
flip through magazines

1156
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:39,812
The female version of Playboy just can’t help it

1157
01:14:39,989 --> 01:14:40,855
Did you buy it?

1158
01:14:41,032 --> 01:14:42,700
No... stolen

1159
01:14:45,557 --> 01:14:47,883
I started masturbating and it was crazy for a week

1160
01:14:50,395 --> 01:14:51,532
Then the magazine disappeared

1161
01:14:52,835 --> 01:14:55,786
Damn, that piece of shit must have been stolen.

1162
01:14:55,964 --> 01:14:57,350
what about me?

1163
01:14:58,289 --> 01:14:59,227
What are you?

1164
01:14:59,550 --> 01:15:02,116
we are always together

1165
01:15:03,169 --> 01:15:04,190
Haven't you ever been so excited?

1166
01:15:05,807 --> 01:15:08,382
George I don't know if I am

1167
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:12,689
But I know I have taste

1168
01:15:14,472 --> 01:15:17,662
Here, here, mom,
just give you a kiss.

1169
01:15:31,238 --> 01:15:32,792
Do you do this with your dad?

1170
01:15:33,678 --> 01:15:34,815
sometimes

1171
01:15:35,764 --> 01:15:36,942
why?

1172
01:15:38,058 --> 01:15:39,559
Helps sensory memory

1173
01:15:40,216 --> 01:15:42,166
Prevent forgetting basic functions

1174
01:15:43,386 --> 01:15:44,668
your ears

1175
01:15:46,796 --> 01:15:47,901
Eye

1176
01:15:49,434 --> 01:15:50,612
nose

1177
01:15:52,364 --> 01:15:53,573
Mouth...

1178
01:15:57,369 --> 01:15:59,423
You know what I like most about you?

1179
01:16:01,821 --> 01:16:03,448
when you put me down

1180
01:16:05,335 --> 01:16:06,868
your tenderness

1181
01:16:08,463 --> 01:16:10,090
Still a little flinching

1182
01:16:11,977 --> 01:16:13,301
your handsome appearance

1183
01:16:15,116 --> 01:16:16,638
And you come from the outside world

1184
01:16:19,672 --> 01:16:21,820
It was you who awakened my tenderness

1185
01:16:24,646 --> 01:16:26,106
You make me crazy about you...

1186
01:16:27,878 --> 01:16:29,995
You are as confused and helpless as me

1187
01:16:34,948 --> 01:16:35,980
George...

1188
01:16:40,203 --> 01:16:41,548
I am pregnant

1189
01:16:50,808 --> 01:16:51,944
So why am I still here?

1190
01:16:53,247 --> 01:16:55,156
Our first time I got pregnant

1191
01:16:56,136 --> 01:16:57,867
Never told you

1192
01:17:00,129 --> 01:17:01,933
What about the delivery room?

1193
01:17:02,569 --> 01:17:04,060
two weeks later

1194
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:08,826
- Congratulations! - Thank you

1195
01:17:11,787 --> 01:17:13,069
Are you afraid?

1196
01:17:14,748 --> 01:17:15,718
No

1197
01:17:17,668 --> 01:17:18,982
I'm afraid

1198
01:17:21,004 --> 01:17:22,256
No need

1199
01:17:40,837 --> 01:17:42,860
Who has to obey today?

1200
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:44,935
- You - Yes, I am obedient.

1201
01:17:45,122 --> 01:17:47,229
- You have to obey.
- I don't listen.

1202
01:17:47,416 --> 01:17:49,887
You have to listen

1203
01:17:55,278 --> 01:17:56,811
-Here you go. -Thank you.

1204
01:17:56,988 --> 01:17:59,314
- No, it's for the account holder.
- I'll show it to him.

1205
01:18:01,086 --> 01:18:04,496
Dad, don't worry about your account.

1206
01:18:05,789 --> 01:18:06,790
Anything else?

1207
01:18:06,967 --> 01:18:07,937
Um

1208
01:18:10,272 --> 01:18:11,284
Look, my dad...

1209
01:18:12,295 --> 01:18:14,235
I can't bring him here every time

1210
01:18:16,362 --> 01:18:19,281
Someone has to be his agent

1211
01:18:19,459 --> 01:18:21,638
Handle his account. What do you think?

1212
01:18:25,996 --> 01:18:28,113
I told you, don't smoke here

1213
01:18:29,031 --> 01:18:30,272
Not lit

1214
01:18:31,325 --> 01:18:33,024
Shouldn't you be at work now?

1215
01:18:33,379 --> 01:18:35,454
- Resigned -
Resigned or got fired?

1216
01:18:36,330 --> 01:18:37,925
I expected it

1217
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:41,168
Don't count on the truck or the money you handed over.

1218
01:18:43,295 --> 01:18:45,161
You shouldn't have done that to George

1219
01:18:45,725 --> 01:18:48,363
How could George do something like that?

1220
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:50,000
He is a gentleman

1221
01:18:51,678 --> 01:18:54,035
Only a bastard like you could do something like that

1222
01:18:55,151 --> 01:18:56,892
It was your son who did it

1223
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:02,105
You bastard

1224
01:19:02,356 --> 01:19:05,275
You try to touch a hair on my
head and I'll let everyone know

1225
01:19:06,047 --> 01:19:07,329
what on earth do you want?

1226
01:19:07,507 --> 01:19:09,060
- Are you gay? - no

1227
01:19:10,082 --> 01:19:11,219
- gay - no

1228
01:19:11,886 --> 01:19:13,836
- Gay? Bisexual? - no no

1229
01:19:15,087 --> 01:19:16,120
no

1230
01:19:16,662 --> 01:19:20,134
Why don't you find a masseuse?

1231
01:19:20,311 --> 01:19:23,158
- Like a normal person.
- I don't want to explain it to you.

1232
01:19:23,690 --> 01:19:25,181
Don't tell me?  How about telling my mother?

1233
01:19:25,358 --> 01:19:27,370
Get out of here

1234
01:19:27,548 --> 01:19:28,934
I don't care, dad

1235
01:19:29,112 --> 01:19:32,375
I'm tired of being here, you all lying to each other

1236
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:35,931
Can you please not go there again?

1237
01:19:58,308 --> 01:19:59,402
Does not look like

1238
01:20:00,247 --> 01:20:03,094
Dad, does this look like your signature?

1239
01:20:04,042 --> 01:20:05,878
What you have is Alzheimer's disease, not the inability to move your limbs.

1240
01:20:06,545 --> 01:20:08,766
It's not Alzheimer's
disease, it's vascular dementia

1241
01:20:08,985 --> 01:20:10,372
How's it going with Paula?

1242
01:20:10,789 --> 01:20:11,654
fine

1243
01:20:11,831 --> 01:20:13,781
fine?  Is there nothing else to say?

1244
01:20:13,959 --> 01:20:16,534
- Stop it.
- No one is allowed to talk here?

1245
01:20:25,574 --> 01:20:27,034
You recognize this, right?

1246
01:20:27,253 --> 01:20:28,150
have no idea

1247
01:20:28,848 --> 01:20:30,903
This is an officially approved signature card

1248
01:20:31,247 --> 01:20:33,614
It's not a card, it's just a piece of paper.

1249
01:20:33,895 --> 01:20:36,888
Take it and you can withdraw money from your account

1250
01:20:37,795 --> 01:20:39,067
or save money

1251
01:20:40,224 --> 01:20:42,299
-Whose authorization? - Dad's

1252
01:20:43,530 --> 01:20:46,825
I told you his account is
empty and the pension is mine.

1253
01:20:58,211 --> 01:20:59,525
george

1254
01:21:00,088 --> 01:21:01,412
Dad has another account

1255
01:21:04,999 --> 01:21:07,283
A passbook. You were too young at
that time and don’t remember it.

1256
01:21:08,513 --> 01:21:11,141
When we came to Madrid, my
mother insisted on buying it

1257
01:21:11,328 --> 01:21:13,904
Personal insurance just in case

1258
01:21:14,081 --> 01:21:16,709
She worried it was too messy

1259
01:21:16,897 --> 01:21:18,481
So there you have it...

1260
01:21:19,128 --> 01:21:23,226
I always remember it, but I don’t know if the
insurance is still valid. I don’t know how much it is.

1261
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:25,134
I don’t know if he received it or not.

1262
01:21:26,052 --> 01:21:27,188
Actually got it

1263
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:30,003
He took it

1264
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:35,081
I guess he didn't tell you

1265
01:21:36,864 --> 01:21:38,178
how many?

1266
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:42,850
It wasn't much in the beginning
but Dad put it in the bank...

1267
01:21:45,144 --> 01:21:46,770
Haven't moved for seven years

1268
01:21:47,062 --> 01:21:48,647
Now it's 100,000 euros

1269
01:21:52,901 --> 01:21:54,184
If he signs here

1270
01:21:54,372 --> 01:21:55,466
It's ours

1271
01:21:58,824 --> 01:22:00,378
When did you find out?

1272
01:22:02,338 --> 01:22:04,246
I don't know, I guessed

1273
01:22:04,423 --> 01:22:05,560
That's not a guess

1274
01:22:06,894 --> 01:22:08,698
You either already knew it or you didn’t.

1275
01:22:09,918 --> 01:22:11,618
Why didn't you tell me?

1276
01:22:11,899 --> 01:22:13,078
you are right

1277
01:22:13,849 --> 01:22:15,340
So you can have it all to yourself

1278
01:22:17,228 --> 01:22:19,584
But anyway, this is
good news. We have money.

1279
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:22,295
- It's not yours - Of course not

1280
01:22:22,441 --> 01:22:23,943
It's ours

1281
01:22:24,110 --> 01:22:25,257
Ours?

1282
01:22:27,175 --> 01:22:29,751
It's mine, mine and dad's

1283
01:22:29,928 --> 01:22:33,567
What does he want money for?
We sent him to a nursing home

1284
01:22:33,755 --> 01:22:35,486
He already gave it to
me. Did you hear that?

1285
01:22:36,153 --> 01:22:37,540
He already gave it to me

1286
01:22:38,030 --> 01:22:40,845
Yeah? Gave it to you?
Why isn't it in your hand?

1287
01:22:41,022 --> 01:22:43,170
Why didn't you? Let’s ask dad

1288
01:22:43,358 --> 01:22:46,059
Why didn't you give the money to George?

1289
01:22:46,663 --> 01:22:49,197
- He is the bastard son and I am the good son.
- Stay away from him.

1290
01:22:52,336 --> 01:22:54,473
No dinner, go to bed, you two

1291
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:01,647
Sorry George

1292
01:23:02,596 --> 01:23:03,733
Really sorry

1293
01:23:06,871 --> 01:23:08,529
I'm so fucking selfish

1294
01:23:11,532 --> 01:23:12,815
i have to believe

1295
01:23:12,992 --> 01:23:15,046
When I go out I have hope

1296
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:19,561
I don't have to start over

1297
01:23:20,583 --> 01:23:21,646
at my age

1298
01:23:23,888 --> 01:23:25,098
especially now

1299
01:23:26,078 --> 01:23:28,674
and paola and our future

1300
01:23:30,395 --> 01:23:31,781
Can you understand me?

1301
01:23:36,234 --> 01:23:37,516
You are going to be a father

1302
01:23:40,415 --> 01:23:41,875
Paula is pregnant

1303
01:24:01,290 --> 01:24:02,635
can you forgive me?

1304
01:24:06,650 --> 01:24:07,786
What's wrong?

1305
01:24:11,790 --> 01:24:13,709
Because I hid something from you

1306
01:24:32,081 --> 01:24:33,572
What are you going to do now?

1307
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,356
I don’t know. I’m
thinking about it.

1308
01:24:37,545 --> 01:24:39,485
You're not young anymore, it's time to know what to do

1309
01:24:40,850 --> 01:24:43,760
Well, there are some things that people can't discover all at once.

1310
01:24:47,357 --> 01:24:48,848
When did you find out, Dad?

1311
01:24:51,497 --> 01:24:52,842
What was found?

1312
01:24:53,613 --> 01:24:57,680
Did you discover it all at once or did you realize it slowly?

1313
01:24:57,930 --> 01:24:59,067
I mean

1314
01:25:00,464 --> 01:25:01,538
What were you thinking at the time?

1315
01:25:02,873 --> 01:25:04,259
"I like massage"?

1316
01:25:06,522 --> 01:25:10,234
"I like masturbation"?
"I like men"? Same thing?

1317
01:25:12,403 --> 01:25:13,685
Shut up Israel

1318
01:25:14,207 --> 01:25:16,355
Or did you discover
it all at once? You feel

1319
01:25:17,689 --> 01:25:20,682
"I like men to massage and masturbate me"

1320
01:25:20,786 --> 01:25:22,517
Israel, enough, shut up.

1321
01:25:22,705 --> 01:25:24,050
You want me to shut up?

1322
01:25:24,436 --> 01:25:25,541
What about him?

1323
01:25:26,771 --> 01:25:27,877
Shut up

1324
01:25:30,212 --> 01:25:31,391
Have a meal

1325
01:25:52,724 --> 01:25:53,861
Antonio

1326
01:25:55,821 --> 01:25:57,135
Come here my baby

1327
01:26:00,096 --> 01:26:02,536
I need to be gentle. There's a baby inside.

1328
01:26:03,266 --> 01:26:04,403
congratulations

1329
01:26:06,394 --> 01:26:07,406
Thanks

1330
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,700
we succeeded

1331
01:26:19,897 --> 01:26:21,180
let's celebrate

1332
01:26:26,748 --> 01:26:28,521
- Have you talked to George?
- Didn't talk much

1333
01:26:28,906 --> 01:26:31,451
He is taciturn and has always been silent

1334
01:26:32,566 --> 01:26:36,727
I asked him about it and he said it was awkward. He
felt embarrassed and didn't want to talk about it.

1335
01:26:36,977 --> 01:26:40,585
I was a little frustrated at first

1336
01:26:41,846 --> 01:26:44,349
We are brothers but we are completely different

1337
01:26:44,839 --> 01:26:45,913
let me see

1338
01:26:46,132 --> 01:26:47,550
- Take it off. - Wait.

1339
01:26:48,499 --> 01:26:49,636
It'll be okay

1340
01:26:49,782 --> 01:26:52,075
You're pregnant and we can have sex too

1341
01:26:52,253 --> 01:26:54,307
I know, it's not that one

1342
01:26:54,724 --> 01:26:55,829
Not that one

1343
01:27:00,010 --> 01:27:01,512
So what happened?

1344
01:27:04,296 --> 01:27:06,027
Why did you bring me here?

1345
01:27:07,184 --> 01:27:08,634
We can't be together anymore

1346
01:27:10,417 --> 01:27:13,044
That's news. You've been saying that since we were kids.

1347
01:27:13,441 --> 01:27:14,650
Yeah but it's different this time

1348
01:27:15,255 --> 01:27:16,287
What's wrong?

1349
01:27:16,464 --> 01:27:17,674
I used to be afraid

1350
01:27:18,039 --> 01:27:20,604
I think we're on different paths.

1351
01:27:21,271 --> 01:27:22,658
sooner or later one day

1352
01:27:22,804 --> 01:27:24,744
You're going to dump me
- What do you think now?

1353
01:27:25,546 --> 01:27:29,092
Now I not only think so,
I completely believe it

1354
01:27:29,342 --> 01:27:30,729
you will leave me

1355
01:27:32,334 --> 01:27:33,648
i met another girl

1356
01:27:34,357 --> 01:27:35,744
she is there

1357
01:27:42,803 --> 01:27:44,607
She works in prison?

1358
01:27:46,463 --> 01:27:49,716
For 100,000 euros, come to
think of it, we can do business.

1359
01:27:49,904 --> 01:27:52,824
I've always wanted to open a
video store. Let's open it together.

1360
01:27:56,275 --> 01:27:57,339
What's wrong?

1361
01:27:58,183 --> 01:28:00,404
You don’t even know what I’m thinking

1362
01:28:00,581 --> 01:28:03,157
You should have said it earlier!  You can't blame me!

1363
01:28:03,334 --> 01:28:04,398
Of course not strange

1364
01:28:05,493 --> 01:28:07,401
Then don’t open a video store

1365
01:28:08,339 --> 01:28:09,768
what you up to?

1366
01:28:10,435 --> 01:28:13,000
Antonio, if you want to open a video store, then open it

1367
01:28:13,177 --> 01:28:14,804
do you want a tattoo

1368
01:28:14,950 --> 01:28:16,796
Just get a tattoo - That's good

1369
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:19,580
but you don't want

1370
01:28:20,935 --> 01:28:21,947
In no mood

1371
01:28:23,584 --> 01:28:25,137
what do you want?

1372
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:27,713
What do you want?

1373
01:28:28,557 --> 01:28:30,017
I'm right in front of you

1374
01:28:31,237 --> 01:28:34,157
Tell me what you want

1375
01:28:35,450 --> 01:28:36,836
then satisfy you

1376
01:28:40,945 --> 01:28:42,300
what do you want?

1377
01:28:43,270 --> 01:28:44,803
she needs me

1378
01:28:46,158 --> 01:28:47,410
It's more than that

1379
01:28:49,255 --> 01:28:50,402
That's all for me

1380
01:28:50,996 --> 01:28:52,206
This is currently the case

1381
01:28:52,946 --> 01:28:56,314
There must be other
reasons, not just this.

1382
01:28:57,962 --> 01:29:00,005
You are like God’s charity to me

1383
01:29:02,028 --> 01:29:03,561
I can't help but think so

1384
01:29:06,689 --> 01:29:08,149
Being with her feels different

1385
01:29:12,184 --> 01:29:13,363
a matter of time

1386
01:29:15,771 --> 01:29:17,085
What time?

1387
01:29:18,899 --> 01:29:20,557
you surprised me so much

1388
01:29:49,201 --> 01:29:51,672
- What are you doing?
- My dad is kicking me out.

1389
01:29:52,026 --> 01:29:53,444
I will advise your father

1390
01:29:53,622 --> 01:29:56,687
- He won't.
- It doesn't matter. I don't want to stay anyway.

1391
01:29:57,313 --> 01:29:58,804
Why are you still living with him?

1392
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:03,465
Let's go together, Mom, please

1393
01:30:06,145 --> 01:30:08,647
How about we drive him away?

1394
01:30:15,998 --> 01:30:17,656
I've known about your dad for a long time

1395
01:30:21,493 --> 01:30:23,547
At first I thought it was worse

1396
01:30:24,830 --> 01:30:26,947
I didn't know he went there for a massage.

1397
01:30:27,124 --> 01:30:28,625
And masturbation

1398
01:30:30,919 --> 01:30:31,931
What a bad day

1399
01:30:33,318 --> 01:30:34,350
I'm feeling better now

1400
01:30:35,935 --> 01:30:37,947
Yes before

1401
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:40,554
Your dad makes my life worse than death

1402
01:30:40,731 --> 01:30:42,358
Have you talked to him?

1403
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:44,443
No need

1404
01:30:47,311 --> 01:30:48,770
He is used to it

1405
01:30:51,033 --> 01:30:52,587
I just thought about it

1406
01:30:54,651 --> 01:30:57,571
-You should be more open-minded now.
-What the hell is this?

1407
01:30:57,748 --> 01:30:59,166
- Do not expose family
scandals - Is this a family?

1408
01:30:59,344 --> 01:31:00,376
this is home

1409
01:31:01,815 --> 01:31:03,202
So nonsensical

1410
01:31:04,182 --> 01:31:05,840
I wouldn't use that word

1411
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:21,397
If you tell anyone I'll kick you out

1412
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:29,082
i believe george

1413
01:31:41,584 --> 01:31:42,689
Where is George?

1414
01:31:44,649 --> 01:31:45,619
I have no idea

1415
01:32:03,741 --> 01:32:06,067
Paula What do you want to do when you get out?

1416
01:32:07,954 --> 01:32:09,904
Study a BA in Languages

1417
01:32:10,811 --> 01:32:13,240
Although she wants to do some social work

1418
01:32:14,283 --> 01:32:17,130
Help women who are suffering from the same disease

1419
01:32:17,317 --> 01:32:18,589
Say it again...

1420
01:32:19,299 --> 01:32:22,771
Studying for a BA in Languages
​​Even though she wanted to...

1421
01:32:25,868 --> 01:32:26,806
What did I say?

1422
01:32:29,037 --> 01:32:30,174
What did I say?

1423
01:32:32,374 --> 01:32:34,293
I told you to just sleep with her.

1424
01:33:05,157 --> 01:33:06,502
I should fucking do it too

1425
01:34:24,997 --> 01:34:26,384
Dude...

1426
01:34:27,395 --> 01:34:28,469
Take it easy

1427
01:34:30,596 --> 01:34:32,338
Are clothes important to you?

1428
01:34:33,005 --> 01:34:35,330
It's not the clothes, it's the meaning

1429
01:34:35,852 --> 01:34:37,134
What does it mean?

1430
01:34:38,219 --> 01:34:40,961
regret of distance

1431
01:34:41,806 --> 01:34:43,192
What sense of distance?

1432
01:34:43,755 --> 01:34:45,174
what you get and what you want

1433
01:34:48,687 --> 01:34:49,970
Why is it that way?

1434
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:53,515
Because it's right under your nose

1435
01:34:54,329 --> 01:34:55,757
And it looks good

1436
01:34:57,425 --> 01:34:59,083
No one buys it

1437
01:34:59,511 --> 01:35:01,982
It keeps cutting prices and hasn't sold yet.

1438
01:35:02,608 --> 01:35:04,485
- George - What?

1439
01:35:07,102 --> 01:35:09,177
Why do you never let me buy you anything?

1440
01:35:10,647 --> 01:35:12,972
I want to buy it as a gift for you

1441
01:35:15,026 --> 01:35:16,976
you are like my girlfriend

1442
01:35:17,644 --> 01:35:18,853
Except not having sex

1443
01:35:19,583 --> 01:35:20,938
Don't want to

1444
01:35:27,309 --> 01:35:29,489
I want to buy it myself

1445
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:32,523
You have no money

1446
01:35:33,399 --> 01:35:35,755
I don’t want to buy it. I don’t need money to buy it.

1447
01:35:37,507 --> 01:35:38,863
What do you want to do?

1448
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:42,231
Let's change places, okay?

1449
01:35:58,872 --> 01:36:00,530
Does the car have airbags?

1450
01:36:01,375 --> 01:36:02,438
No

1451
01:36:25,972 --> 01:36:28,600
- Where to go? - interview

1452
01:36:29,517 --> 01:36:31,290
- again? - Yes

1453
01:36:33,167 --> 01:36:35,013
Where did you get the outfit?

1454
01:36:36,233 --> 01:36:37,369
I don't want my mother's money

1455
01:36:37,484 --> 01:36:38,735
I didn't plan to give it to you

1456
01:36:38,839 --> 01:36:41,832
I know, but I have to say I
don’t want it, so you can keep it.

1457
01:36:42,009 --> 01:36:43,114
Of course I will

1458
01:36:43,292 --> 01:36:44,501
You can keep dad’s too.

1459
01:36:44,658 --> 01:36:46,701
No, you keep dad's

1460
01:36:47,442 --> 01:36:49,725
It's your fault that he is in a wheelchair and in a vegetative state

1461
01:36:49,944 --> 01:36:52,520
You have to take care of
him - you think it's my fault

1462
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:03,124
Eat quickly, Dad, we have to go

1463
01:37:03,718 --> 01:37:05,251
What to do?

1464
01:37:06,158 --> 01:37:07,430
you're so dumb?

1465
01:37:10,256 --> 01:37:11,507
Forget it

1466
01:37:11,685 --> 01:37:13,833
Sign another one. Fortunately,
I still have a spare one.

1467
01:37:16,596 --> 01:37:17,868
- Antonio - What?

1468
01:37:23,791 --> 01:37:25,177
You remembered my name!

1469
01:37:25,949 --> 01:37:26,981
let me see

1470
01:37:29,327 --> 01:37:31,997
What is my name? Say it
again, what is my name?

1471
01:37:32,351 --> 01:37:33,561
What is my name?

1472
01:37:54,550 --> 01:37:55,864
George...

1473
01:37:58,408 --> 01:37:59,733
Goodbye dad, I'm out

1474
01:38:01,443 --> 01:38:03,278
Goodbye, good son

1475
01:38:03,632 --> 01:38:04,946
help me...

1476
01:38:28,960 --> 01:38:32,328
What are you doing here?
Can't you stay away from me?

1477
01:38:32,505 --> 01:38:35,216
Of course, you have to line up, dad.

1478
01:38:36,582 --> 01:38:37,823
What?

1479
01:38:40,232 --> 01:38:42,932
I've been here for a while to spend your money

1480
01:38:45,768 --> 01:38:47,708
What's wrong with you?

1481
01:38:48,438 --> 01:38:49,720
Like father, like son

1482
01:38:51,847 --> 01:38:53,797
you are not gay israel

1483
01:38:54,631 --> 01:38:57,207
I raised you. Parents know their children best.

1484
01:38:58,291 --> 01:38:59,709
Grandpa didn't realize you were gay?

1485
01:39:02,118 --> 01:39:03,328
Be polite Israel

1486
01:39:04,026 --> 01:39:05,204
Don't be as big or small as me

1487
01:39:10,574 --> 01:39:12,232
If you don’t come in the future, I won’t come.

1488
01:39:12,691 --> 01:39:16,726
How about this? You come one,
three, five, I come two, four, six

1489
01:39:18,228 --> 01:39:19,500
avoid embarrassment

1490
01:39:30,125 --> 01:39:31,856
- See you later - Goodbye

1491
01:39:32,033 --> 01:39:33,066
goodbye

1492
01:39:38,196 --> 01:39:39,259
Hello

1493
01:39:40,281 --> 01:39:41,313
Thanks

1494
01:39:46,965 --> 01:39:49,634
- Cleaning - seven years

1495
01:39:49,812 --> 01:39:51,720
- this? - very good

1496
01:39:54,368 --> 01:39:56,422
- Business Administration
Degree - Questions?

1497
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:57,955
None Excellent

1498
01:39:58,164 --> 01:40:00,239
It's overkill, right?

1499
01:40:01,229 --> 01:40:03,210
No la

1500
01:40:03,388 --> 01:40:04,555
please understand us

1501
01:40:05,223 --> 01:40:07,517
I don't want you to use this as a springboard

1502
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:11,135
- I want stable employees -
I studied my degree by myself

1503
01:40:12,146 --> 01:40:14,201
The cleaning staff still has time to learn something on her own.

1504
01:40:14,972 --> 01:40:17,297
Yes. Do you have any relatives?

1505
01:40:18,444 --> 01:40:19,998
Well I have a girlfriend

1506
01:40:20,186 --> 01:40:21,093
That doesn't count as family

1507
01:40:21,333 --> 01:40:23,658
Actually we are husband
and wife and she is pregnant

1508
01:40:24,221 --> 01:40:25,649
pregnant with a girl

1509
01:40:26,525 --> 01:40:30,300
She's working abroad
and will be back soon

1510
01:40:35,910 --> 01:40:38,308
If you weren't in jail would you still notice me?

1511
01:40:39,153 --> 01:40:40,675
Maybe not

1512
01:40:42,458 --> 01:40:44,960
Do you want to be with me when you come out?

1513
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:49,694
ok that's it

1514
01:40:49,694 --> 01:40:51,217
Anything else?

1515
01:40:51,571 --> 01:40:53,104
Can I wear a suit?

1516
01:40:53,761 --> 01:40:54,772
what ever

1517
01:40:55,471 --> 01:40:56,399
good

1518
01:41:06,743 --> 01:41:09,933
Why did you resign?
What happened?

1519
01:41:10,986 --> 01:41:11,779
No

1520
01:41:12,373 --> 01:41:14,323
I need a change

1521
01:41:14,532 --> 01:41:16,409
Do you still do cleaning?

1522
01:41:16,721 --> 01:41:18,598
Is this considered a change?

1523
01:41:18,775 --> 01:41:19,787
Yes

1524
01:41:29,776 --> 01:41:31,225
I prefer another rooftop

1525
01:41:33,081 --> 01:41:34,322
What are you looking for?

1526
01:41:34,990 --> 01:41:37,002
have some fun

1527
01:41:40,141 --> 01:41:41,350
just like you

1528
01:41:52,945 --> 01:41:56,866
Danglang Danglang Danglang...

1529
01:41:57,429 --> 01:42:00,317
Danglang Danglang Danglang...

3
00:01:43,375 --> 00:01:44,458
你这狗杂种...

4
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:50,583
站住！

5
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:27,761
乔治

6
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:32,558
乔治 告诉我不是你干的

7
00:02:35,654 --> 00:02:37,208
拜托 告诉我不是你

8
00:02:41,713 --> 00:02:42,682
是我

9
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:45,842
不 不是你...

10
00:02:47,593 --> 00:02:49,700
我做不了物业保洁员

11
00:02:50,023 --> 00:02:51,128
做不了 真的做不了

12
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:53,255
我无法和你一起生活

13
00:02:54,236 --> 00:02:55,414
我已经尽力了

14
00:02:56,185 --> 00:02:57,395
我发誓

15
00:02:57,645 --> 00:02:59,074
我要开始新的生活

16
00:03:00,085 --> 00:03:01,399
很抱歉 爸爸

17
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:06,685
你能理解 对吧？

18
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:10,898
我无能为力

19
00:03:13,932 --> 00:03:15,069
我也不想这样

20
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:21,930
爸爸

21
00:03:24,266 --> 00:03:25,788
爸爸？

22
00:03:27,884 --> 00:03:28,885
爸爸！

23
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:32,472
爸爸！

24
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,600
爸爸...

25
00:03:35,986 --> 00:03:36,955
爸爸

26
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:38,843
爸爸

27
00:03:40,063 --> 00:03:41,408
醒醒啊...

28
00:03:42,002 --> 00:03:42,982
爸爸

29
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:58,915
七年后

30
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:51,791
该走了

31
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,420

你好

35
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:38,525
你不想和我说话吗？

36
00:05:40,892 --> 00:05:41,955
为什么不想呢？

37
00:05:42,456 --> 00:05:43,770
因为你是坏人

38
00:05:45,344 --> 00:05:46,929
你为什么觉得我是坏人？

39
00:05:47,711 --> 00:05:49,786
这里所有的女人都是坏人

40
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:57,784
嗨 你到底过不过来

41
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:10,599

好了 估计你们也看出来了
这是戏剧课

52
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,495
是吧？

53
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:44,268
当然 当我们傻啊

54
00:06:44,455 --> 00:06:46,218

00:06:48,459 --> 00:06:50,295
花枝招展 英俊潇洒

57
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,017
我知道你们来的目的
你们对戏剧才没兴趣呢

58
00:06:54,194 --> 00:06:55,685
你们来这蠢蠢欲动

59
00:06:55,863 --> 00:06:57,176
不是找女友就是找男友

60
00:06:57,677 --> 00:07:00,732
如果你们真为此而来 那请离开

61
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,922
好吧 曼罗洛 她说对了

62
00:07:03,099 --> 00:07:04,632

00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,776

煎蛋？

71
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:50,031

你在做什么？

73
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,141

00:12:09,614 --> 00:12:11,042
- 我们去做弥撒吗？
- 不去

129
00:12:11,251 --> 00:12:14,139
- 我听到钟声了
- 不是 那不是

130
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:15,870
告诉你妈准备好

131
00:12:16,058 --> 00:12:17,226
好 我会的

132
00:12:17,413 --> 00:12:18,414
她在哪呢？

133
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:20,051
她现在也该回来了

134
00:12:20,229 --> 00:12:22,064
这是什么电影 爸爸？

135
00:12:22,251 --> 00:12:24,160
那女人到底想干啥？

136
00:12:24,504 --> 00:12:27,142
- "黑穗病开始了..."
- 她让我不安

137
00:12:27,434 --> 00:12:29,300
"黑穗病在比利牛斯山脉开始蔓延了"

138
00:12:29,488 --> 00:12:30,802
这是啥玩意？放开我

139
00:12:31,636 --> 00:12:34,597
- 回来再说
- 别走 和我们一起做弥撒

140
00:12:35,046 --> 00:12:36,078
放开我！

141
00:12:36,683 --> 00:12:38,142
这样你就不会伤到自己

142
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:41,062
你想害死我

143
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,924
弱智

144
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:51,708
他们把你爸打扮得像个兔崽子

145
00:12:55,921 --> 00:12:57,902
笑吧 西班牙大老爷们

146
00:13:01,874 --> 00:13:03,929
七年才大学毕业

147
00:13:04,064 --> 00:13:05,138
我一直做兼职

148
00:13:05,732 --> 00:13:06,713
是吗？

149
00:13:07,265 --> 00:13:08,298
还在做呢

150
00:13:11,134 --> 00:13:13,209
没写工作经历啊

151
00:13:14,022 --> 00:13:16,097
和申请职位没联系

152
00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:18,151
你以前做什么的？

153
00:13:18,328 --> 00:13:19,715
看门的

154
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:21,592
守门员？

155
00:13:22,614 --> 00:13:24,970
不是 看门人

156
00:13:25,773 --> 00:13:26,806
在公寓里工作

157
00:13:51,069 --> 00:13:53,666
我们要用扫帚 当道具

158
00:13:53,853 --> 00:13:58,483
扫帚是扫垃圾的  但今天...

159
00:13:58,827 --> 00:13:59,932
出什么事了？

160
00:14:00,151 --> 00:14:02,508
今天扫帚将做交通工具

161
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:06,262
它能让你飞

162
00:14:06,481 --> 00:14:08,556
让你穿墙走壁

163
00:14:08,921 --> 00:14:10,829
谁来示范下？

164
00:14:11,006 --> 00:14:13,081
- 跳啊！ 加油 飞起来
- 根本没反应

165
00:14:13,446 --> 00:14:15,104
- 跳啊！
- 它根本不会起飞！

166
00:14:15,281 --> 00:14:17,648
跳 跳 跳！

167
00:14:25,343 --> 00:14:27,324
好吧 下一个志愿者

168
00:14:27,502 --> 00:14:28,398
飞一个给大家看看

169
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,608
你还没高潮？

170
00:14:30,244 --> 00:14:32,423
这地方难以集中精神

171
00:14:32,747 --> 00:14:33,852
咱俩换个位置吧

172
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:35,499
算了吧

173
00:14:36,052 --> 00:14:37,126
大家都这么说

174
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,120
如果你在我上面  会给阴蒂更多摩擦

175
00:14:41,276 --> 00:14:43,038
不了 还是这样更好

176
00:14:43,778 --> 00:14:44,790
更好什么呀？

177
00:14:49,065 --> 00:14:50,274
容易受孕

178
00:15:26,227 --> 00:15:28,688
我跟你说过 别给我爸看色情片

179
00:15:28,865 --> 00:15:31,826
一看就没完没了

180
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:33,766
他压根就不能自控

181
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:35,330
嗯 我会注意的

182
00:15:36,383 --> 00:15:38,708
你认识街对面那变态吗？

183
00:15:39,303 --> 00:15:41,221
- 哪个？
- 骑摩托那个

184
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,202
他家百叶窗总关着

185
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,319
空调坏了

186
00:15:45,674 --> 00:15:46,685
那怎么了？

187
00:15:46,789 --> 00:15:48,625
得打开窗呗

188
00:15:48,802 --> 00:15:51,054
能看到屋里  他是按摩师

189
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,027
我后背拉伤了 妈的

190
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:57,112
扶我爸时弄的
-约一下

191
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,281
他在报纸上还登了广告

192
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:04,182
今天面试了吗

193
00:16:05,058 --> 00:16:06,079
嗯

194
00:16:06,236 --> 00:16:07,591
怎么样啊？

195
00:16:10,136 --> 00:16:11,658
不怎么样 很糟糕

196
00:16:13,264 --> 00:16:14,400
他收多少服务费？

197
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:17,508
80 欧元

198
00:16:19,009 --> 00:16:20,177
真他妈的贵

199
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,857
包括手淫

200
00:16:27,038 --> 00:16:28,362
他还给客人口交呢

201
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:29,999
100块一次

202
00:16:30,385 --> 00:16:31,553
给你吧 谢了

203
00:16:34,973 --> 00:16:35,984
乔治

204
00:16:37,444 --> 00:16:39,519
咱俩就像两条鱼

205
00:16:40,781 --> 00:16:43,627
两条普通的鱼
问题是你并不知足

206
00:16:43,815 --> 00:16:45,577
活在鱼缸里无法让你满足

207
00:16:45,901 --> 00:16:47,454
鱼缸很酷的 老兄

208
00:16:47,809 --> 00:16:48,956
实际非常酷

209
00:16:51,886 --> 00:16:53,095
我们走 爸爸

210
00:16:53,627 --> 00:16:54,764
一 二

211
00:16:55,744 --> 00:16:56,818
三

212
00:17:01,906 --> 00:17:03,043
这么久拿到学位

213
00:17:04,169 --> 00:17:05,556
为什么？

214
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,851
我不能正常上课
我得照顾我父亲

215
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,383
他怎么了？

216
00:17:11,301 --> 00:17:13,407
七年前他得了中风

217
00:17:15,472 --> 00:17:18,141
血管性痴呆  就是脑供血不足

218
00:17:19,267 --> 00:17:21,207
有时他什么都不知道

219
00:17:21,353 --> 00:17:22,844
把手举起来 爸爸

220
00:17:23,469 --> 00:17:26,358
举起胳膊 高点

221
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:32,927
- 就你一个人照顾他吗
- 是的  我处理得很好

222
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,023
可以这么说

223
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:47,191
爸 我刚给你换过

224
00:17:48,348 --> 00:17:49,287
现在怎么办？

225
00:17:49,464 --> 00:17:50,601
一定很不容易

226
00:17:52,457 --> 00:17:53,698
还有别的亲人吗？

227
00:17:54,542 --> 00:17:56,555
有一个哥哥 可是...

228
00:17:56,732 --> 00:17:57,702
可是什么？

229
00:17:58,682 --> 00:18:00,214
他和我父亲不和

230
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,779
为什么呢？

231
00:18:03,176 --> 00:18:04,761
典型的家庭矛盾

232
00:18:09,015 --> 00:18:11,559
乔治 妈的 骗得了谁啊？

233
00:18:11,726 --> 00:18:13,874
你永远也找不到个像样的活儿

234
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,700
太衰了你 乔治  真衰

235
00:18:17,336 --> 00:18:18,608
我真该教育教育你

236
00:18:19,797 --> 00:18:21,121
醒醒吧 老弟

237
00:18:21,475 --> 00:18:22,508
学学怎么撒谎

238
00:18:22,685 --> 00:18:24,113
否则你寸步难行

239
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,439
没错 你多能耐啊

240
00:18:29,056 --> 00:18:31,308
我进来是因为愚蠢  不是撒谎

241
00:18:31,558 --> 00:18:33,331
一家一个蠢货就够了

242
00:18:33,477 --> 00:18:35,656
你就给我省省吧

243
00:18:35,844 --> 00:18:38,305
3号 五分钟

244
00:18:38,732 --> 00:18:39,900
好的

245
00:18:41,933 --> 00:18:43,695
这个 给我买到这个东西

246
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:45,134
这是什么？

247
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:47,939
激素

248
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,858
人工合成激素

249
00:18:50,035 --> 00:18:51,213
想成肌肉猛男？

250
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:52,746
才不是呢

251
00:18:53,413 --> 00:18:56,437
这玩意能让女人更容易怀孕

252
00:18:56,573 --> 00:18:57,720
听一个朋友说的

253
00:18:58,074 --> 00:19:00,473
底米特律 他是个内行

254
00:19:01,275 --> 00:19:03,288
我靠 你这变态!

255
00:19:05,207 --> 00:19:07,459
你什么意思 让女人怀孕？

256
00:19:13,308 --> 00:19:14,935
她正点不？

257
00:19:15,884 --> 00:19:16,749
相当正点

258
00:19:16,927 --> 00:19:18,949
她是我的女朋友   我的女友

259
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:22,349
戏剧课上认识的

260
00:19:23,193 --> 00:19:24,257
什么时候？

261
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:25,310
大概一个月前

262
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:28,480
- 你想要小孩
- 难道你不想当叔叔吗？

263
00:19:28,657 --> 00:19:29,898
安东尼奥...

264
00:19:31,754 --> 00:19:32,995
你脑子进水了？

265
00:19:35,581 --> 00:19:38,208
你见过妇幼病房吗？我也没见过

266
00:19:38,813 --> 00:19:40,398
听说相当不错

267
00:19:40,732 --> 00:19:42,348
根本不像监狱

268
00:19:42,744 --> 00:19:45,841
房间华丽 还有小花点缀

269
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:48,135
小孩子们打打闹闹

270
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:51,232
有整托所  还有大夫  环境优雅

271
00:19:53,359 --> 00:19:55,934
就凭这些 我就一定让她怀上孕

272
00:19:56,518 --> 00:19:58,072
然后稳稳当当地进妇幼病房

273
00:19:58,437 --> 00:19:59,375
你懂吗？

274
00:19:59,553 --> 00:20:02,128
5号 时间到

275
00:20:02,337 --> 00:20:03,369
瞧瞧她 乔治

276
00:20:04,391 --> 00:20:05,840
别人对她动粗

277
00:20:06,017 --> 00:20:09,354
她们用尽办法折磨她
她必须去妇幼病房

278
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,139
她们嫉妒她
因为在这种地方

279
00:20:13,327 --> 00:20:14,390
她就是个公主

280
00:20:14,787 --> 00:20:15,861
就像穷人

281
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,406
憎恶有钱人一样 谁不想有钱啊？

282
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:20,521
你不也是吗？

283
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:22,023
- 恨有钱人？
- 不是

284
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,024
放屁

285
00:20:23,243 --> 00:20:25,078
你就恨3楼那老太太

286
00:20:25,266 --> 00:20:28,415
她把垃圾扔你手上 瞟都不瞟你

287
00:20:30,344 --> 00:20:32,325
你干嘛迷上她？

288
00:20:32,502 --> 00:20:34,118
你就要出来了

289
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:36,423
你没爱过吗？

290
00:20:36,986 --> 00:20:38,539
没想为女人做些事？

291
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,771
你想过

292
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:43,617
肯定想过的

293
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,381
但不是为我
你从没为我做过什么

294
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,590
现在你得帮我

295
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:51,177
如果能搞到这玩意

296
00:20:52,741 --> 00:20:53,951
我就如愿了

297
00:21:06,901 --> 00:21:07,975
你要干什么？

298
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,863
给你理理发 太长了

299
00:21:11,051 --> 00:21:12,542
不用 你妈会给我弄的

300
00:21:12,678 --> 00:21:13,783
- 就一点儿
- 不行

301
00:21:13,971 --> 00:21:15,326
爸... 该死

302
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:18,204
我靠

303
00:21:25,378 --> 00:21:26,410
你干什么呢？

304
00:21:27,922 --> 00:21:30,279
我爸爱看野生动物摄影

305
00:21:30,633 --> 00:21:32,510
我继承家族传统呢

306
00:21:33,104 --> 00:21:34,418
把那相机放下

307
00:21:36,306 --> 00:21:37,661
赚了钱咱俩分

308
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:39,392
肖恩 少说废话 放下

309
00:21:39,955 --> 00:21:42,739
前几天我看到一男的进去了

310
00:21:43,198 --> 00:21:46,420
已婚 还有三个漂亮的小女儿

311
00:21:47,025 --> 00:21:49,381
谁料到孩子的爹变态

312
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,915
老天不该惩罚这种人吗？

313
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,668
- 拿走了
- 你烦不烦啊？

314
00:21:55,544 --> 00:21:57,837
你最近真招人烦 别神经质了

315
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,371
我请你按摩  快活下

316
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,831
想敲诈我啊？

00:22:02,019 --> 00:22:03,750
- 走吧
- 我不走

318
00:22:03,927 --> 00:22:06,951
你离不开我  没我 你就活不了

319
00:22:07,128 --> 00:22:08,139
你说什么？

320
00:22:08,317 --> 00:22:12,133
你离不开我

321
00:22:13,051 --> 00:22:14,396
你需要我

322
00:22:15,345 --> 00:22:16,554
你要是拿走

323
00:22:16,731 --> 00:22:18,504
我就再也不回来了

324
00:22:20,767 --> 00:22:21,872
再带走 米古儿

325
00:22:22,748 --> 00:22:25,188
米古儿? 你给那鱼起的名

326
00:22:25,532 --> 00:22:28,003
米古儿 一条普通的鱼   和咱俩一样

327
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,757
有种  你就别理我

328
00:22:32,873 --> 00:22:34,082
来吧 哥们

329
00:22:40,495 --> 00:22:42,403
你不打算按我门铃吗？

330
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,118
娜塔莉

331
00:22:49,681 --> 00:22:50,692
海

332
00:22:55,385 --> 00:22:56,740
你什么时候回来的？

333
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:58,231
昨晚

334
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:00,942
我身上很脏

335
00:23:01,683 --> 00:23:02,965
我不在乎

336
00:23:08,752 --> 00:23:10,410
手怎么了

337
00:23:14,206 --> 00:23:15,634
你去哪里了

338
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,167
- 出国了
- 哪个国家？

339
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:18,408
学习

340
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:20,983
学习 那有啥用？

341
00:23:21,171 --> 00:23:22,172
爸...

342
00:23:24,163 --> 00:23:25,435
你天天都吃阿司匹林

343
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,666
对吗？

344
00:23:27,844 --> 00:23:28,783
是的

345
00:23:29,304 --> 00:23:31,285
我去那地就生产阿司匹林

346
00:23:31,608 --> 00:23:33,621
德国的勒沃库森

347
00:23:34,392 --> 00:23:35,810
在那做药剂实习生

348
00:23:37,176 --> 00:23:39,043
我们要迟到了  都怪你

349
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,880
你不能弄这头型去

350
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:49,512
你真烦

351
00:23:49,699 --> 00:23:51,566
受够你了

352
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,319
成事不足败事有余

353
00:23:54,704 --> 00:23:58,187
你一直如此 还故意这么做

354
00:23:58,364 --> 00:24:00,502
- 总有一天我就...
- 你怎么着？

355
00:24:01,941 --> 00:24:03,077
教堂钟响了吗？

356
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:04,860
还没呢

357
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,896
去洗个澡 都有味儿了

358
00:24:24,276 --> 00:24:25,704
过把瘾就死

359
00:24:28,738 --> 00:24:29,948
宝贝用力 再来

360
00:24:30,334 --> 00:24:32,836
快点 快到我们上场了

00:24:33,712 --> 00:24:35,328
- 别停下
- 吻我耳朵

362
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:49,707
你俩完事没？

363
00:24:52,773 --> 00:24:55,442
我受够你俩了 下一步我该怎么办

364
00:24:56,214 --> 00:24:59,311
我要举报 你俩就玩完了

365
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:01,292
妈的 我意思是

366
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:04,253
- 申请一个私会
- 我们已经请求过了

367
00:25:05,025 --> 00:25:06,234
你们就不能忍一忍？

368
00:25:07,287 --> 00:25:08,810
他也没那么帅吧

369
00:25:10,311 --> 00:25:11,521
安东尼奥

370
00:25:15,003 --> 00:25:16,557
你带牙套了

371
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:17,787
牙箍

372
00:25:19,664 --> 00:25:20,916
像个黄毛丫头

373
00:25:22,657 --> 00:25:23,866
就这个吗

374
00:25:24,054 --> 00:25:25,472
一年了你就发现这个

375
00:25:26,213 --> 00:25:27,182
就这些

376
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,329
是吗

377
00:25:29,549 --> 00:25:31,947
你的牙缝越来越大

378
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:33,751
让我看看 张嘴

379
00:25:34,137 --> 00:25:35,076
- 不行
- 张开

380
00:25:35,222 --> 00:25:36,285
- 别
- 给我看看

381
00:25:36,473 --> 00:25:37,609
没变啦

382
00:25:46,107 --> 00:25:47,317
难啊

383
00:25:48,297 --> 00:25:49,371
什么难

384
00:25:49,726 --> 00:25:52,322
- 我们重拾旧梦
- 从何开始？

385
00:25:53,698 --> 00:25:55,043
我也记不清了

386
00:25:56,128 --> 00:25:57,337
所以很难嘛

387
00:25:58,286 --> 00:26:00,361
你家人不是要卖房子吗？

388
00:26:00,549 --> 00:26:02,280
卖出前  我会一直住这

389
00:26:02,457 --> 00:26:05,345
那我就把“出售”牌子摘掉

390
00:26:07,785 --> 00:26:08,964
我很想你

391
00:26:12,373 --> 00:26:13,447
我也是

392
00:26:24,656 --> 00:26:26,638
嗨 我来看看我哥

393
00:26:31,653 --> 00:26:32,717
乔治 你看着我

394
00:26:33,603 --> 00:26:34,666
你在笑我

395
00:26:34,854 --> 00:26:35,793
看着我

396
00:26:35,928 --> 00:26:37,461
我没笑啦  我很难过

397
00:26:37,847 --> 00:26:38,983
放屁

398
00:26:39,901 --> 00:26:41,913
你在笑你傻大哥

399
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:44,238
- 看着我
- 我没笑  看见了吧？

400
00:26:49,296 --> 00:26:51,402
-对不起
- 你这兔崽子

401
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,830
我差点死掉

402
00:26:53,748 --> 00:26:55,135
你要在这待多久？

403
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:56,939
不知道 几天吧

404
00:26:58,232 --> 00:26:59,306
真糟透了

405
00:26:59,942 --> 00:27:01,704
他们批准我和保拉“私会”了

406
00:27:01,892 --> 00:27:03,508
我俩第一次“私会”

407
00:27:03,977 --> 00:27:05,009
以后还会有的

408
00:27:07,074 --> 00:27:07,971
看看

409
00:27:08,148 --> 00:27:09,462
你看怎么样

410
00:27:11,318 --> 00:27:12,454
有点俗

411
00:27:12,642 --> 00:27:14,748
我自己做的

412
00:27:15,697 --> 00:27:17,397
- 戴上
- 我不要

413
00:27:17,574 --> 00:27:18,929
“我不要”

414
00:27:19,107 --> 00:27:21,286
不是给你的 是给保拉的

415
00:27:23,079 --> 00:27:24,143
扶我起来

416
00:27:26,552 --> 00:27:28,084
- 把这个给她
- 不行 安东尼奥

417
00:27:29,617 --> 00:27:31,244
难道你不想见她？

418
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,506
- 我不知道
-“你不知道”

419
00:27:34,591 --> 00:27:36,353
其实她想见你

420
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:38,897
我把你都跟她说了

421
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,483
你可是家里的希望

422
00:27:41,963 --> 00:27:43,986
你出头就是我出头

423
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:48,011
告诉她你见过我了

424
00:27:48,855 --> 00:27:50,033
她就不会多心了

425
00:27:50,451 --> 00:27:52,077
这次私会你是为了我们家

426
00:27:52,265 --> 00:27:54,069
她就是我们家人 乔治

427
00:27:54,246 --> 00:27:55,351
她是我的人

428
00:27:56,853 --> 00:27:58,313
甭说废话

429
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:06,039
你完成了

430
00:28:06,946 --> 00:28:08,051
完成什么？

431
00:28:08,552 --> 00:28:11,054
学业  我在你屋里看到你学位证书了

432
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,454
你来调查我的吧

433
00:28:15,538 --> 00:28:17,238
你为什么不告诉我？

434
00:28:18,468 --> 00:28:20,481
你从没给我机会让你惊喜

435
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,297
恭喜你

436
00:28:25,527 --> 00:28:26,737
谢谢

437
00:28:59,207 --> 00:29:01,741
安东尼奥 说这是他亲手做的

438
00:29:03,305 --> 00:29:05,150
你和你哥一点都不像

439
00:29:06,652 --> 00:29:08,112
幸好不一样

440
00:29:10,969 --> 00:29:13,294
- 是吗 一切都好吧
-  嗯

441
00:29:14,097 --> 00:29:15,755
他还是到处惹事

442
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:23,095
乔治  他们给你哥做了一些检查

443
00:29:23,283 --> 00:29:29,404
他左侧睾丸有静脉曲张
无生育能力

444
00:29:29,581 --> 00:29:30,509
他从没说过

445
00:29:31,458 --> 00:29:32,918
可以手术的

446
00:29:34,513 --> 00:29:36,880
但是候诊就要一年多

447
00:29:38,173 --> 00:29:39,414
手术才半个小时？

448
00:29:41,019 --> 00:29:42,302
他为什么没告诉我？

449
00:29:43,074 --> 00:29:44,502
你了解你哥的

450
00:29:44,679 --> 00:29:46,066
他觉得没面子

451
00:29:46,692 --> 00:29:48,600
他缺乏安全感 觉得自己不男人

452
00:29:48,777 --> 00:29:50,404
我会和他聊聊的  让他放心

453
00:29:54,178 --> 00:29:55,596
乔治  我想求你一件事

454
00:29:57,171 --> 00:30:00,226
实际是为了我俩  是他的主意

455
00:30:02,458 --> 00:30:03,594
我哥的主意

456
00:30:06,701 --> 00:30:07,911
要我做什么

457
00:30:11,675 --> 00:30:13,375
你能让我怀孕么

458
00:30:16,263 --> 00:30:19,297
他说他要和你说 你就不会来了

459
00:30:22,769 --> 00:30:24,052
保拉...

460
00:30:24,719 --> 00:30:26,492
我刚开始排卵

461
00:30:26,951 --> 00:30:28,932
保拉  真的抱歉

462
00:30:32,310 --> 00:30:33,311
看看

463
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,855
看看她们怎么虐待我的

464
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:38,556
她们为什么那么做？

465
00:30:42,748 --> 00:30:44,437
- 别这样  保拉
- 你哥说...

466
00:30:44,625 --> 00:30:48,337
你非常喜欢邻家女孩

467
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,434
求你穿上

468
00:30:53,707 --> 00:30:55,782
你可以闭上眼睛 把我当成她

469
00:31:22,193 --> 00:31:24,143
出售

470
00:31:32,631 --> 00:31:34,612
爸爸为什么要把货车卖了

471
00:31:34,998 --> 00:31:36,353
因为他要卖

472
00:31:36,531 --> 00:31:38,157
不是留给我的吗

473
00:31:38,408 --> 00:31:39,909
我怎么不知道这回事

474
00:31:40,743 --> 00:31:42,328
你想要那货车

475
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,103
卖出一条鱼就给你

476
00:31:47,531 --> 00:31:49,085
我不能 我找到工作了

477
00:31:50,305 --> 00:31:51,243
哦 是吗？

478
00:31:51,838 --> 00:31:52,974
那你怎么不工作

479
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:55,560
我晚点再开始

480
00:31:55,946 --> 00:31:56,884
做什么工作？

481
00:31:57,062 --> 00:31:59,168
做白痴

482
00:32:01,274 --> 00:32:02,515
我是监视白痴的

483
00:32:04,152 --> 00:32:05,508
- 你和她睡了吗
- 没

484
00:32:05,685 --> 00:32:07,040
你睡了 你这兔崽子

485
00:32:07,353 --> 00:32:08,709
我没和她睡！

486
00:32:09,866 --> 00:32:12,014
你该和她睡的  难道你不喜欢她吗？

487
00:32:12,608 --> 00:32:13,818
保拉 没让你蠢蠢欲动

488
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:17,958
你同性恋 还是没在状态

489
00:32:18,145 --> 00:32:20,126
- 少跟我胡扯
- 有完没完？

490
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,198
我就知道你没种
我都料到了

491
00:32:31,502 --> 00:32:33,056
但现在我心里更好受

492
00:32:34,839 --> 00:32:36,956
因为你有原则

493
00:32:37,769 --> 00:32:39,187
现在能信任你了

494
00:32:39,333 --> 00:32:41,210
- 信任我？
- 完成使命

495
00:32:41,387 --> 00:32:42,732
我不会做任何事的

496
00:32:44,098 --> 00:32:46,205
你知道那些变态怎么做的吗？

497
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:48,613
他们自己割掉老二

498
00:32:49,489 --> 00:32:51,366
惨不忍睹

499
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:55,328
大夫没辙  只能给他们手术
我也该照做

500
00:32:55,547 --> 00:32:56,653
看见了吧？

501
00:32:56,934 --> 00:32:58,769
我要自己动手了

502
00:32:58,988 --> 00:33:00,125
安东尼奥  行了吧

503
00:33:12,418 --> 00:33:13,732
你就会捅漏子

504
00:33:18,821 --> 00:33:20,103
保拉 等不上一年的

505
00:33:22,470 --> 00:33:24,722
如果我不做  别人会取代我

506
00:33:25,817 --> 00:33:27,131
她会找别的男人做的

507
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,039
她只能和你生孩子

508
00:33:29,227 --> 00:33:31,656
像她那样的女人  出去后还会要我吗

509
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:36,901
我出去了  她还能给我幸福吗

510
00:33:37,089 --> 00:33:38,580
那就放弃

511
00:33:38,757 --> 00:33:40,811
乔治  我从没求过你什么事

512
00:33:41,155 --> 00:33:42,292
再说一遍

513
00:33:42,761 --> 00:33:44,628
反正没求过重要的事

514
00:33:45,295 --> 00:33:46,828
拜托 老兄

515
00:33:48,392 --> 00:33:50,091
你做  就是我做

516
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:52,844
生孩子不会解决任何问题

517
00:33:54,137 --> 00:33:56,285
这是我的问题

518
00:34:03,219 --> 00:34:04,491
注意个人卫生

519
00:34:13,615 --> 00:34:15,805
公寓出售  详情咨询管理员

00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,741

525
00:34:32,853 --> 00:34:33,885
还是英语？

526
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:35,981
我还是不进了

527
00:34:36,336 --> 00:34:37,993
我想让你见见他们

528
00:34:39,505 --> 00:34:40,642
怎么不给我打电话？

529
00:34:41,977 --> 00:34:43,113
那你还能来吗？

530
00:34:45,762 --> 00:34:47,357

倒垃圾

00:34:58,180 --> 00:34:59,286
一会再过来

535
00:34:59,682 --> 00:35:00,923
我说西班牙语

536
00:35:07,721 --> 00:35:10,943
- 他们在庆祝什么？
- 不清楚

537
00:35:13,842 --> 00:35:15,260
我见了我哥的女友

538
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:18,013
- 在哪？
- 监狱私会

539
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:21,944
- 那是专门做爱的
- 或者聊天

540
00:35:22,121 --> 00:35:23,612
没人用私会来聊天

541
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:24,999
你就知道做爱

542
00:35:27,512 --> 00:35:28,826
她想要个小孩

543
00:35:29,013 --> 00:35:32,131
-  我哥不育
- 那我来

544
00:35:32,319 --> 00:35:34,185
- 干什么？
- 妈的 明知故问

545
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:35,968
没门

546
00:35:36,281 --> 00:35:37,386
为什么？

547
00:35:39,305 --> 00:35:40,838
他们想让我做

548
00:35:43,069 --> 00:35:45,352
你哥让你把他女友肚子搞大？

549
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:47,719
不是吧...

550
00:36:00,117 --> 00:36:01,400
我爸是同志

551
00:36:02,964 --> 00:36:04,392
和别的同志一样

552
00:36:04,643 --> 00:36:05,883
比别人更同志

553
00:36:06,624 --> 00:36:07,969
咱俩换得了

554
00:36:08,813 --> 00:36:09,919
好啊

555
00:36:22,483 --> 00:36:23,766
你没逗我吧？

556
00:36:24,402 --> 00:36:25,194
没有

557
00:36:25,549 --> 00:36:26,373
哦

558
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:28,708
别光“哦”  说点别的

559
00:36:31,774 --> 00:36:33,161
手淫还是口交？

560
00:36:33,338 --> 00:36:35,111
不知道  我又没盯着看  老兄

561
00:36:39,219 --> 00:36:40,918
还懂规矩！

562
00:36:42,629 --> 00:36:44,015
我还有呢

563
00:36:46,706 --> 00:36:48,197
手淫的

564
00:36:57,560 --> 00:36:59,573
- 什么东西？
- 一些广告

565
00:37:01,418 --> 00:37:04,442
广告上是邮戳  提前付款  不是邮票吧

566
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:07,362
那样有优惠

567
00:37:07,612 --> 00:37:09,072
你不该工作了吗？

568
00:37:09,249 --> 00:37:11,053
你的午饭

569
00:37:12,137 --> 00:37:13,722
也给他做了

570
00:37:14,223 --> 00:37:16,235
难怪他游手好闲

571
00:37:17,705 --> 00:37:18,769
妈...

572
00:37:22,502 --> 00:37:23,784
我非常爱你

573
00:37:30,572 --> 00:37:33,315
有了工作  他乖顺多了

574
00:37:43,867 --> 00:37:46,223
如果你接受这工作的话

575
00:37:46,922 --> 00:37:50,019
你就得辞去现在的工作 对吗？

576
00:37:50,196 --> 00:37:52,417
- 是的
- 你还有别的去处吗？

577
00:37:53,053 --> 00:37:54,054
没有了

578
00:37:54,888 --> 00:37:57,432
你要在这工作50小时每周

579
00:37:58,058 --> 00:38:01,218
- 谁来照顾你父亲呢？
- 我来想办法吧

580
00:38:01,395 --> 00:38:02,406
不

581
00:38:02,583 --> 00:38:04,731
在这儿你的问题就是我的问题

582
00:38:04,909 --> 00:38:07,547
你的父亲就是我的父亲

583
00:38:08,527 --> 00:38:09,914
还有 你的工作非常棒

584
00:38:10,101 --> 00:38:11,968
有固定收入 安稳的住处

585
00:38:12,218 --> 00:38:13,949
你的父亲会得到很好的照顾

586
00:38:14,137 --> 00:38:15,482
我摸的是什么 爸爸？

587
00:38:16,358 --> 00:38:17,432
我的耳朵

588
00:38:18,235 --> 00:38:20,038
我的耳朵呢？ 在哪？

589
00:38:21,717 --> 00:38:23,031
找找看

590
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,835
这里

591
00:38:25,648 --> 00:38:27,598
我的眼睛呢？

592
00:38:30,132 --> 00:38:31,112
好

593
00:38:31,769 --> 00:38:34,094
这叫什么？ 你有两个

594
00:38:34,834 --> 00:38:36,002
爸爸？

595
00:38:36,367 --> 00:38:38,056
- 儿子...
- 什么？

596
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,882
你为什么不愿意做物业保洁？

597
00:38:41,132 --> 00:38:42,488
你为什么不愿意做物业保洁？

598
00:38:44,261 --> 00:38:45,616
因为我不想做

599
00:38:45,793 --> 00:38:47,493
因为我不想做

600
00:38:50,632 --> 00:38:53,822
非常抱歉通知您 鉴于岗位有限

601
00:38:54,104 --> 00:38:56,648
竞争激烈

602
00:38:56,784 --> 00:38:58,931
暂时无法向您提供这个职位...

603
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:04,155
"您的简历已被我方收集到数据库 待未来考虑

604

此致..."

605
00:39:35,405 --> 00:39:36,792
你在这里做什么？

606
00:39:38,294 --> 00:39:39,785
外头太热了

607
00:39:40,348 --> 00:39:41,881
给 我第一月的工资

608
00:39:42,121 --> 00:39:44,133
你可以还贷款了 对吧？

609
00:40:00,212 --> 00:40:03,235
- 你为什么总躲避我
- 我

610
00:40:03,413 --> 00:40:04,591
嗯 你一直在逃避

611
00:40:04,737 --> 00:40:06,364
我一天20小时都在这

612
00:40:07,271 --> 00:40:08,345
不是和我在一起

613
00:40:09,711 --> 00:40:10,951
干吗衣冠楚楚的

614
00:40:11,139 --> 00:40:13,537
我要去制药实验室工作了

615
00:40:13,715 --> 00:40:15,060
怎么样啊？

616
00:40:15,247 --> 00:40:16,905
还在适应呢

617
00:40:17,124 --> 00:40:19,272
- 下午好
- 拜拜 阿方索

618
00:40:20,461 --> 00:40:21,848
我都这么做了一辈子了

619
00:40:22,275 --> 00:40:23,245
做什么？

620
00:40:24,528 --> 00:40:25,539
逃避你

621
00:40:39,636 --> 00:40:41,326
你哥知道你会回来的

622
00:40:42,139 --> 00:40:43,202
我还没有决定

623
00:40:44,641 --> 00:40:46,226
你有一个小时做决定

624
00:40:53,306 --> 00:40:56,601
我去南美过暑假 没想到一待就待了两年

625
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:57,925
为了他？

626
00:40:58,801 --> 00:41:00,261
我们在马格瑞塔岛相遇

627
00:41:01,241 --> 00:41:03,316
我在一个豪华度假村工作

628
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:06,246
做外事联络员  他搞房地产

629
00:41:06,903 --> 00:41:07,935
嗯

630
00:41:08,853 --> 00:41:10,177
反正他是这么跟我说的

631
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:14,317
事发突然  开始我们处得很好

632
00:41:15,506 --> 00:41:17,862
他每月都去两次西班牙

633
00:41:19,916 --> 00:41:21,512
他对我很着迷

634
00:41:24,546 --> 00:41:26,006
五个月后我怀孕了

635
00:41:28,164 --> 00:41:30,489
他想让孩子生在西班牙

636
00:41:31,334 --> 00:41:32,502
我同意了

637
00:41:33,138 --> 00:41:35,254
他给我买了张机票  我就飞回来了

638
00:41:36,235 --> 00:41:38,080
他有事耽搁了几天

639
00:41:38,706 --> 00:41:39,811
当然是工作上的事

640
00:41:40,478 --> 00:41:41,490
到底怎么了？

641
00:41:42,814 --> 00:41:45,171
他怎么也没料到一个大肚子的西班牙女孩

642
00:41:45,348 --> 00:41:47,089
会被海关扣押了

643
00:41:48,069 --> 00:41:49,759
你不知道你拿的什么东西吗？

644
00:41:49,915 --> 00:41:50,885
不知道

645
00:41:54,086 --> 00:41:55,295
我也不想知道

646
00:41:57,078 --> 00:41:58,392
内心深处有一个声音告诉我

647
00:41:58,569 --> 00:42:00,551
甭想那么多

648
00:42:02,751 --> 00:42:05,493
家人现在还以为我在马格瑞塔岛呢

649
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:08,308
他后来联系过你吗？

650
00:42:12,729 --> 00:42:13,981
你干嘛还留着这东西？

651
00:42:14,679 --> 00:42:16,035
这样我就不会忘记

652
00:42:16,984 --> 00:42:19,830
我被关进来不是他的错  是我自找的

653
00:42:21,082 --> 00:42:22,990
我上了飞机

654
00:42:23,449 --> 00:42:25,357
拎着行李

655
00:42:27,901 --> 00:42:29,809
一想到那儿我就受不了

656
00:42:35,805 --> 00:42:37,327
你朋友都走了吗？

657
00:42:38,901 --> 00:42:40,976
你以前在学校里也这样

658
00:42:41,821 --> 00:42:43,896
从不和我的朋友交往

659
00:42:45,335 --> 00:42:46,920
我不愿意和别人分享你

660
00:42:48,463 --> 00:42:50,340
恋爱不是这样的

661
00:42:51,112 --> 00:42:53,510
你为什么还和我在一起 你都要出国了

662
00:42:54,792 --> 00:42:56,325
选了一个不会有结果的时刻

663
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:57,743
我没那么做

664
00:42:58,275 --> 00:42:59,349
是的 你是那么做的

665
00:43:00,089 --> 00:43:01,851
你把我弄得心灰意冷

666
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:04,573
现在我回来了

667
00:43:08,952 --> 00:43:10,308
你现在在和谁约会吗？

668
00:43:10,767 --> 00:43:11,559
没有

669
00:43:12,466 --> 00:43:13,572
以前和谁约会过吗？

670
00:43:15,042 --> 00:43:16,189
看什么意义上的

671
00:43:16,366 --> 00:43:17,753
任何意义

672
00:43:18,702 --> 00:43:19,703
是的

673
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:24,322
你呢？

674
00:43:27,533 --> 00:43:28,472
没有

675
00:43:29,035 --> 00:43:30,839
来这时 孩子四个月了

676
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,268
我直接就了妇幼病房

677
00:43:36,167 --> 00:43:37,377
已经有了胎动

678
00:43:38,701 --> 00:43:41,245
我整天待在外头 晒太阳

679
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:45,833
他们有一天给我做了超声波

680
00:43:48,377 --> 00:43:50,181
胎儿没有心跳

681
00:43:53,799 --> 00:43:55,822
他们就给我做了流产

682
00:43:57,876 --> 00:43:59,889
他们把我弄出产房

683
00:44:01,912 --> 00:44:03,569
不让我看我的女儿

684
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:08,793
我很想见我的孩子

685
00:44:14,883 --> 00:44:16,207
是个女孩

686
00:44:18,887 --> 00:44:22,005
- 你还剩多长时间？
- 三年零七个月

687
00:44:24,903 --> 00:44:26,228
我是说现在

688
00:44:26,509 --> 00:44:27,969
这次私会

689
00:44:34,507 --> 00:44:36,206
这是我们初吻的地方

690
00:44:36,394 --> 00:44:37,603
还记得吗？

691
00:44:39,866 --> 00:44:41,180
还被我爸给逮到了

692
00:44:42,963 --> 00:44:44,798
我特别怕他

693
00:44:46,237 --> 00:44:48,906
你知道他后来和我说什么了吗？

694
00:44:51,315 --> 00:44:52,327
他说

695
00:44:52,493 --> 00:44:54,610
" 你脑子想啥呢

696
00:44:54,798 --> 00:44:56,487
别妄想天鹅肉了

697
00:44:56,779 --> 00:44:57,790
听明白了么？

698
00:44:58,343 --> 00:44:59,354
你就省省吧”

699
00:44:59,699 --> 00:45:01,575
那时我们才11岁

700
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,558
这件事刻在我心里

701
00:45:05,861 --> 00:45:07,967
让我一直无法释怀

702
00:45:11,116 --> 00:45:12,211
这需要时间

703
00:45:47,851 --> 00:45:49,926
我也和别人约过会

704
00:45:50,114 --> 00:45:51,771
为你高兴

705
00:45:51,959 --> 00:45:54,660
我没告诉你是因为 你不会介意的

706
00:45:55,296 --> 00:45:56,849
我为什么要介意？

707
00:46:00,238 --> 00:46:03,012
看到你和别人约会  我就会介意

708
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:07,746
你愿意约谁就约谁嘛

709
00:46:14,012 --> 00:46:17,078
你和别人约会 我心里很不舒服

710
00:46:42,687 --> 00:46:43,782
再见

711
00:47:04,844 --> 00:47:05,783
什么事

712
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:08,317
你好 我想做个按摩

713
00:47:08,671 --> 00:47:10,162
请进

714
00:47:17,023 --> 00:47:20,735
不好意思 空调坏了
他们要好几周才能修好

715
00:47:20,923 --> 00:47:22,727
- 先生贵姓？
- 雷蒙

716
00:47:24,437 --> 00:47:25,782
想洗个澡吗？

717
00:47:26,804 --> 00:47:29,233
- 不用了 这样就行
- 好的

718
00:47:29,859 --> 00:47:31,913
脱了吧 雷蒙

719
00:47:32,122 --> 00:47:34,895
脸朝下躺下
我一会儿就回来

720
00:47:38,597 --> 00:47:39,462
什么事？

721
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:40,641
哦 你好

722
00:47:42,246 --> 00:47:44,228
不好意思 我现在有客人

723
00:47:44,405 --> 00:47:47,356
请一会再来
抱歉 再见

724
00:47:50,943 --> 00:47:52,475
感觉如何？好么？

725
00:47:53,132 --> 00:47:54,863
你背部肌肉很紧张

726
00:47:55,186 --> 00:47:58,252
是啊 工作的关系 才把背部弄伤的

727
00:48:01,276 --> 00:48:02,485
转过身来

728
00:48:03,434 --> 00:48:04,446
干什么？

729
00:48:04,613 --> 00:48:06,041
好做完啊

730
00:48:06,531 --> 00:48:08,116
我不要手淫

731
00:48:09,837 --> 00:48:10,900
那口交呢？

732
00:48:11,265 --> 00:48:13,340
不 我啥都不要

733
00:48:13,695 --> 00:48:14,842
都包括在价格里了

734
00:48:15,019 --> 00:48:16,750
我不需要

735
00:48:19,096 --> 00:48:20,159
看起来你想要

736
00:48:33,110 --> 00:48:34,215
注意 我要先说这个

737
00:48:34,403 --> 00:48:36,905
你们想听我的陈述 决定是否让我获得假释

738
00:48:37,395 --> 00:48:39,648
没人不是这样想的吧？

739
00:48:39,929 --> 00:48:42,525
关键是你们是否相信

740
00:48:42,713 --> 00:48:44,100
我的良好动机

741
00:48:44,277 --> 00:48:45,831
如果这么讲

742
00:48:46,644 --> 00:48:48,761
不管我说得多天花乱坠 都不会打动你们

743
00:48:48,938 --> 00:48:50,711
我觉得关键在于

744
00:48:50,888 --> 00:48:52,244
我的改造结果

745
00:48:53,537 --> 00:48:56,758
这样吧  我就静坐一会儿

746
00:48:57,572 --> 00:49:01,211
你们看着我 看多久都没关系

747
00:49:02,473 --> 00:49:05,319
看看我是否脱胎换骨了

748
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:21,502
这西装真他妈帅  过来看看

749
00:49:21,825 --> 00:49:22,847
魅力四射 幸运无敌

750
00:49:23,452 --> 00:49:25,506
我就搞不懂了 你怎么就不喜欢呢

751
00:49:25,683 --> 00:49:28,008
- 看看他们给我戴的玩意
- 什么东西？

752
00:49:28,363 --> 00:49:29,990
微型监视芯片

753
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:33,013
有这玩意 他们就能监测到我的行踪

754
00:49:33,264 --> 00:49:35,380
或者是否在做这个

755
00:49:36,298 --> 00:49:37,758
做那个的

756
00:49:39,113 --> 00:49:40,250
不可思议吧？

757
00:49:47,392 --> 00:49:48,456
你们接吻了？

758
00:49:49,342 --> 00:49:51,876
你们做了多久？
没多久吧 我猜 那么多次...

759
00:49:52,053 --> 00:49:55,421
你不是想听所有细节吧?

760
00:49:58,174 --> 00:49:59,634
她脱光了么？

761
00:49:59,811 --> 00:50:02,241
脱了底裤就足够了

762
00:50:04,336 --> 00:50:07,006
-  她高潮了吗？
- 没有 我们也没接吻  妈的

763
00:50:08,340 --> 00:50:09,727
你满意了？

764
00:50:11,500 --> 00:50:13,272
她要是高潮了 我非得弄死她

765
00:50:16,891 --> 00:50:19,216
- 你怎么了？
- 呼吸困难

766
00:50:20,029 --> 00:50:21,239
看着我

767
00:50:21,625 --> 00:50:23,397
你不是想蹲大号吧？

768
00:50:24,482 --> 00:50:27,287
- 我得下车
- 安东尼奥  我们还得坐...

769
00:50:27,443 --> 00:50:28,611
- 停车
- 安东尼奥!

770
00:50:29,174 --> 00:50:30,602
- 停车 我上不来气
- 不行的

771
00:50:30,957 --> 00:50:32,375
我刚从监狱出来 妈的

772
00:50:32,521 --> 00:50:34,460
- 不可以的
- 开门!

773
00:50:35,753 --> 00:50:36,932
慢慢呼吸

774
00:50:38,256 --> 00:50:39,330
真不爽

775
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:42,083
这就是刨根问底的代价

776
00:50:42,437 --> 00:50:43,605
才不是呢

777
00:50:44,867 --> 00:50:46,295
我突然发现...

778
00:50:46,816 --> 00:50:48,370
我现在出来了

779
00:50:48,558 --> 00:50:49,913
自由了...

780
00:50:50,091 --> 00:50:51,957
我他妈的干什么去呀？

781
00:50:52,176 --> 00:50:53,417
不知所措

782
00:50:54,157 --> 00:50:57,077
回家吧 帮我照顾爸爸

783
00:50:58,537 --> 00:51:00,486
我不能回家  你知道的

784
00:51:01,008 --> 00:51:02,217
为什么不能？

785
00:51:02,436 --> 00:51:03,573
爸爸根本不会注意的

786
00:51:04,563 --> 00:51:06,545
有时候他都认不出我来

787
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,691
是吗？

788
00:51:10,788 --> 00:51:11,894
这还不错

789
00:51:19,558 --> 00:51:21,288
爸 觉得怎么样？

790
00:51:21,851 --> 00:51:23,760
今天学得如何？ 作业多吗？

791
00:51:24,427 --> 00:51:25,491
是的 很多

792
00:51:25,855 --> 00:51:28,003
去做吧  我可不要傻儿子

793
00:51:29,505 --> 00:51:31,163
看看这是谁 爸爸
看看

794
00:51:36,429 --> 00:51:38,086
你也有作业吗？

795
00:51:39,035 --> 00:51:40,214
他说“作业”？

796
00:51:40,537 --> 00:51:42,549
作业 看看这张脸

797
00:51:45,062 --> 00:51:46,303
来 看着我

798
00:51:47,596 --> 00:51:48,983
你还记得我的名字吗？

799
00:51:50,484 --> 00:51:51,798
- 乔治
- 你就知道乔治？

800
00:51:54,593 --> 00:51:55,906
你总共有几个儿子？

801
00:51:58,075 --> 00:51:58,972
一个

802
00:51:59,149 --> 00:52:01,777
一个？
你难道把我宰了吗?

803
00:52:02,006 --> 00:52:03,101
你把我宰了

804
00:52:04,092 --> 00:52:06,552
我再也不存在了  拜拜了...

805
00:52:08,648 --> 00:52:10,452
你能带我去做弥撒吗？

806
00:52:11,537 --> 00:52:12,506
当然可以

807
00:52:13,904 --> 00:52:15,071
那走吧

808
00:52:16,375 --> 00:52:17,897
- 不行的
- 走吧

809
00:52:18,074 --> 00:52:20,504
听 爸爸
教堂钟声响了

810
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:23,496
一出门 他就受不了的

811
00:52:24,758 --> 00:52:26,416
听 爸爸
"当啷 当啷 当啷..."

812
00:52:26,979 --> 00:52:30,420
- 安东尼奥 不行的 我都试过了
- "当啷 当啷..."

813
00:52:30,879 --> 00:52:33,579
"当啷 当啷..."

814
00:52:33,767 --> 00:52:35,081
"当啷..."

815
00:52:44,966 --> 00:52:47,604
我哥和我爸在一起  我和你在这

816
00:52:48,031 --> 00:52:50,357
你是不是希望换一下？

817
00:52:51,024 --> 00:52:52,963
都不希望

818
00:52:54,256 --> 00:52:57,447
你真会让你女人在做完爱后觉得舒服

819
00:53:02,744 --> 00:53:04,798
我哥身上是什么吸引的你？

820
00:53:05,987 --> 00:53:07,603
他坐在我旁边

821
00:53:08,416 --> 00:53:09,876
逗我发笑

822
00:53:10,606 --> 00:53:14,214
他的眼睛很好看  他是这里唯一的

823
00:53:14,402 --> 00:53:15,371
身上没有纹身的人

824
00:53:15,590 --> 00:53:17,665
他说要是在外头 你绝不会注意到他

825
00:53:18,791 --> 00:53:20,866
- 也许吧
- 他还说你会甩了他

826
00:53:21,044 --> 00:53:23,442
只要你一出去 生个孩子

827
00:53:23,588 --> 00:53:25,079
也许就会不一样了

828
00:53:26,163 --> 00:53:27,581
我从没骗过你哥

829
00:53:32,701 --> 00:53:34,359
你怎么那么躺着？

830
00:53:36,215 --> 00:53:38,853
这样更容易受孕

831
00:53:40,636 --> 00:53:41,700
胡扯

832
00:53:43,003 --> 00:53:45,078
你就从没做过什么 仅仅因为有某种可能？

833
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:52,189
讲讲娜塔莉吧

834
00:53:53,336 --> 00:53:55,067
她快过生日了

835
00:53:55,286 --> 00:53:56,600
打算给她啥礼物？

836
00:53:57,893 --> 00:53:59,968
我总给她相同的礼物

837
00:54:01,376 --> 00:54:03,972
有钱的女孩会来么？那种外表腼腆

838
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,266
实际风骚浪荡的

839
00:54:06,485 --> 00:54:08,143
你他妈到底怎么了？

840
00:54:08,403 --> 00:54:11,876
没什么 随便说说而已
上次和女人上床是什么时候？

841
00:54:12,606 --> 00:54:13,638
不久前

842
00:54:14,420 --> 00:54:16,495
不久前？到底什么时候？

843
00:54:18,904 --> 00:54:20,436
- 嗨
- 嗨

844
00:54:20,645 --> 00:54:22,136
娜塔莉，保洁来了
有没有垃圾？

845
00:54:22,981 --> 00:54:24,889
这开场白真他妈的强

846
00:54:25,306 --> 00:54:26,932
她开玩笑的 请进

847
00:54:27,120 --> 00:54:28,090
生日快乐

848
00:54:28,507 --> 00:54:29,445
谢谢

849
00:54:30,175 --> 00:54:31,499
我俩买的

850
00:54:32,229 --> 00:54:34,826
是我们仨
不是我们仨么

851
00:55:01,144 --> 00:55:03,917
我爸是个变态
那我也是吧

852
00:55:04,272 --> 00:55:06,941
唉 如果他同性恋 那我也得是了

853
00:55:07,129 --> 00:55:10,048
扯淡 去做个按摩不代表任何事

854
00:55:10,257 --> 00:55:12,207
他可能无意中走错了地方呢

855
00:55:12,384 --> 00:55:14,782
不可能  他后来还去了很多次

856
00:55:14,960 --> 00:55:17,983
不可思议 我恐吓他 他还是照去不误

857
00:55:18,474 --> 00:55:21,529
- 他没上钩  我靠
- 让他见鬼去吧

858
00:55:21,706 --> 00:55:24,031
那天我先去了那

859
00:55:26,471 --> 00:55:27,931
一下子不知所措

860
00:55:28,317 --> 00:55:30,986
- 你做了按摩？
- 我别无选择

861
00:55:31,174 --> 00:55:32,519
是没法选择

862
00:55:32,696 --> 00:55:33,770
按摩舒服么？

863
00:55:34,271 --> 00:55:35,855
挺爽的 按摩嘛

864
00:55:36,043 --> 00:55:38,149
他的手法很娴熟

865
00:55:38,441 --> 00:55:41,434
他很专业 也许我爸去那就是为了按摩

866
00:55:41,570 --> 00:55:45,083
他干活常会腰肌劳损  你不该往坏处想的

867
00:55:45,261 --> 00:55:47,544
扛水是很费体力的
-那手淫呢？

868
00:55:47,732 --> 00:55:49,390
他给你爸手淫 又能怎样？

869
00:55:49,953 --> 00:55:51,757
真给你爸手淫了么？

870
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:54,332
你脑子有问题啊？

871
00:55:54,864 --> 00:55:56,418
我？
问这个？

872
00:55:56,814 --> 00:55:59,139
你能想这种事 真让人受不了

873
00:56:01,683 --> 00:56:02,789
精彩

874
00:56:02,966 --> 00:56:04,989
很正点 是不？

875
00:56:05,166 --> 00:56:06,960
手淫还是口交？

876
00:56:10,098 --> 00:56:12,152
手淫 别问了

877
00:56:15,562 --> 00:56:17,053
娜塔莉 问一个问题

878
00:56:19,013 --> 00:56:20,848
我老弟的JJ  你是不是也

879
00:56:21,161 --> 00:56:23,664
一见钟情？

880
00:56:32,610 --> 00:56:34,206
你又老样子 不合群

881
00:56:34,383 --> 00:56:35,665
跟你哥哥学学

882
00:56:35,843 --> 00:56:38,804
你错了  我没不合群

883
00:56:39,534 --> 00:56:40,545
我一直盯着你呢

884
00:56:40,681 --> 00:56:41,932
是吗？

885
00:56:42,558 --> 00:56:45,477
你妈给我打过电话 让我看着你

886
00:56:45,967 --> 00:56:48,366
发现有事  就给她打电话

887
00:56:49,241 --> 00:56:50,253
哦

888
00:56:50,461 --> 00:56:52,338
那我得贿赂你啦

889
00:56:55,258 --> 00:56:56,363
什么东西？

890
00:56:57,030 --> 00:56:58,584
贡仔罗 在人力资源做事

891
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:02,213
我把你都跟他说了 他在等你的电话 安排面试

892
00:57:02,953 --> 00:57:04,819
咱俩在一个公司共事？

893
00:57:05,529 --> 00:57:06,696
不好吗？

894
00:57:07,854 --> 00:57:10,669
职场上谈私交是被禁止的哦

895
00:57:10,815 --> 00:57:12,025
这太糟糕了

896
00:57:13,078 --> 00:57:16,060
我知道原因  影响生产效率

897
00:57:16,279 --> 00:57:17,488
浪费时间

898
00:57:18,229 --> 00:57:19,365
确实如此

899
00:57:19,928 --> 00:57:23,046
贡仔罗是赞成还是反对这种原则呢？

900
00:57:23,234 --> 00:57:24,965
你没想到我的工作怎么来的吧？

901
00:57:28,593 --> 00:57:29,605
怎么了？

902
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:30,908
我吗？没什么

903
00:57:31,721 --> 00:57:34,391
你看起来很无所谓

904
00:57:35,725 --> 00:57:36,664
喝多了吧？

905
00:57:36,841 --> 00:57:38,457
不是 不仅如此

906
00:57:42,889 --> 00:57:45,078
弹得不错 真酷

907
00:57:45,360 --> 00:57:46,465
非常感谢

908
00:57:48,665 --> 00:57:50,469
嘿 听着

909
00:57:51,658 --> 00:57:53,462
我怀疑自己同性恋

910
00:57:54,025 --> 00:57:55,933
你愿意和我上床吗？

911
00:57:56,361 --> 00:57:57,914
我就想证实一下

912
00:57:58,999 --> 00:58:01,021
你为什么不和男人试呢？

913
00:58:01,188 --> 00:58:02,168
不行

914
00:58:43,084 --> 00:58:44,398
你干嘛穿这身衣服？

915
00:58:46,661 --> 00:58:47,985
人都哪去了？

916
00:58:48,757 --> 00:58:49,779
都走了

917
00:58:49,935 --> 00:58:51,218
你去哪了？

918
00:58:51,958 --> 00:58:53,053
卫生间呢

919
00:58:53,240 --> 00:58:54,419
待了两小时？

920
00:58:56,514 --> 00:58:58,558
我以为你不辞而别了呢

921
00:58:58,735 --> 00:59:00,049
我不会的

922
00:59:01,102 --> 00:59:03,157
- 你真帅
- 是么

923
00:59:04,585 --> 00:59:06,764
乔治 老兄

924
00:59:08,829 --> 00:59:10,111
我射了

925
00:59:10,601 --> 00:59:11,665
我是正常男人

926
00:59:12,791 --> 00:59:16,430
嘿 赶紧回来  我还没快活够呢

927
00:59:16,764 --> 00:59:17,932
那太糟了

928
00:59:20,486 --> 00:59:21,904
弱智

929
00:59:24,449 --> 00:59:26,180
他们破坏了气氛

930
00:59:26,889 --> 00:59:28,620
我都习惯他了

931
00:59:34,438 --> 00:59:36,972
如果咱俩发生点事
那都是这套西服惹的祸

932
00:59:38,848 --> 00:59:39,995
那就脱掉吧

933
01:00:11,068 --> 01:00:12,653
天那 你干嘛呢？

934
01:00:14,655 --> 01:00:16,490
至少等我洗完啊

935
01:00:19,910 --> 01:00:23,059
刮鼻毛？你以前从没刮过

936
01:00:24,988 --> 01:00:26,229
一边去 出去

937
01:00:26,417 --> 01:00:27,866
这还有一个...

938
01:00:28,221 --> 01:00:29,952
- 出去！
- 好 别火

939
01:00:30,098 --> 01:00:31,067
出去！

940
01:00:31,245 --> 01:00:32,392
滚出去！

941
01:00:35,697 --> 01:00:39,107
下次私会  我该和我老弟一起来

942
01:00:39,597 --> 01:00:42,412
咱仨聊聊 然后我就离开

943
01:00:43,882 --> 01:00:45,863
- 不要 我会觉得不好意思
- 为什么？

944
01:00:46,552 --> 01:00:47,730
不该这样的

945
01:00:47,918 --> 01:00:48,846
太戏剧化了

946
01:00:51,431 --> 01:00:52,672
我想抚摸你

947
01:00:57,417 --> 01:00:58,553
安东尼奥 别这样

948
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:00,086
你以前不这样的

949
01:01:00,576 --> 01:01:01,681
哦 我就是

950
01:01:02,213 --> 01:01:03,569
有点不舒服
体谅我一下吧

951
01:01:03,954 --> 01:01:04,893
好吧

952
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,586
- 你想我么？
- 当然

953
01:01:11,118 --> 01:01:12,192
尤其是上戏剧课时

954
01:01:12,546 --> 01:01:13,756
近来如何？要提防点

955
01:01:13,933 --> 01:01:14,840
那些坏蛋...

956
01:01:15,091 --> 01:01:16,675
5号 时间到

957
01:01:16,894 --> 01:01:18,427
别让别人对你为所欲为

958
01:01:18,813 --> 01:01:21,024
告诉他们你男友是谁！

959
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:22,973
告诉他们！
我会给他们颜色看的

960
01:01:23,787 --> 01:01:26,414
5号 请退出聊天室

961
01:01:41,356 --> 01:01:42,524
你不要拿走吗？

962
01:01:44,203 --> 01:01:45,068
是你爸爸的

963
01:01:45,496 --> 01:01:46,601
他不穿的

964
01:01:47,613 --> 01:01:49,729
还记得我妈以前总是从邻居那里

965
01:01:49,917 --> 01:01:51,471
收集旧衣服

966
01:01:51,648 --> 01:01:53,243
- 给穷人穿？
- 是的

967
01:01:55,579 --> 01:01:58,499
她总先把合身的衣服挑出来 给我们穿

968
01:01:59,937 --> 01:02:02,221
她总是捡邻居扔的衣服

969
01:02:03,274 --> 01:02:04,807
别人都笑我们

970
01:02:04,974 --> 01:02:08,039
我没笑过你
你还穿过我衬衫呢

971
01:02:08,978 --> 01:02:10,041
挺帅的吧

972
01:02:14,202 --> 01:02:17,111
带走吧
要不以后别来给我过生日了

973
01:02:27,767 --> 01:02:29,227
我看到保拉了

974
01:02:29,926 --> 01:02:31,907
她还好吧？有何新闻？

975
01:02:32,084 --> 01:02:34,816
没什么 也许你也有点问题

976
01:02:35,702 --> 01:02:38,236
过来 让我看看

977
01:02:39,383 --> 01:02:42,271
我给你下周预定了个私会

978
01:02:44,013 --> 01:02:47,005
你为何不去？
你该多去看看她？

979
01:02:47,631 --> 01:02:48,987
干什么去啊？

980
01:02:49,508 --> 01:02:50,968
- 我干什么去啊？
- 陪陪她啊

981
01:02:51,875 --> 01:02:54,304
去抚摸她 亲她 和她上床

982
01:02:54,836 --> 01:02:57,088
你到底想让我怎么样？想让我难堪？

983
01:02:57,996 --> 01:02:59,497
让我更无地自容？

984
01:02:59,945 --> 01:03:01,405
我不是说清楚了吗？

985
01:03:02,031 --> 01:03:03,699
- 爸爸 这是什么？
- 我的钱

986
01:03:03,876 --> 01:03:05,649
- 你从哪拿的？
- 抽屉里

987
01:03:05,826 --> 01:03:08,329
他的帐户是空的
他的养老金都在我这

988
01:03:08,579 --> 01:03:09,611
你这个贼

989
01:03:09,862 --> 01:03:13,751
你知道为了每次私会保拉得干多少活吗？

990
01:03:14,731 --> 01:03:17,651
- 我不能和两个女人在一起
- 什么两个女人？

991
01:03:18,287 --> 01:03:19,903
- 娜塔莉...
- 没有另外一个

992
01:03:20,091 --> 01:03:21,477
你与保拉什么都没有

993
01:03:21,832 --> 01:03:23,563
你只是和她上床 明白吗？

994
01:03:23,917 --> 01:03:25,648
你听懂没？
你在和谁恋爱？

995
01:03:26,566 --> 01:03:29,235
- 娜塔莉
- 正确 甭说废话

996
01:03:36,232 --> 01:03:38,557
如果我们继续  我感觉我在欺骗她

997
01:03:39,370 --> 01:03:40,684
你打算和她坦白吗？

998
01:03:41,696 --> 01:03:42,874
我应该这么做

999
01:03:48,348 --> 01:03:50,256
但我不想

1000
01:03:51,163 --> 01:03:52,967
不想知道这些

1001
01:03:59,442 --> 01:04:01,246
别紧张 我们什么都不做了

1002
01:04:01,841 --> 01:04:04,937
- 我们都到这了...
- 不必 乔治

1003
01:04:06,710 --> 01:04:08,962
我理解你  真的  没关系的

1004
01:04:10,996 --> 01:04:12,028
你失望了？

1005
01:04:14,437 --> 01:04:15,448
是的

1006
01:04:16,074 --> 01:04:19,546
我以为我和你能有未来
你却从没认真过

1007
01:04:23,414 --> 01:04:24,478
如果我以后不来了

1008
01:04:24,697 --> 01:04:27,439
你会再找别人吗？ 还是等我哥？

1009
01:04:30,473 --> 01:04:32,006
在这你别无选择

1010
01:04:49,857 --> 01:04:51,870
我们到了

1011
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:53,580
这不是教堂

1012
01:04:53,788 --> 01:04:56,562
爸 上帝无所不在

1013
01:04:57,198 --> 01:04:58,585
- 你好
- 你好

1014
01:04:59,075 --> 01:05:02,443
- 我想重开他的账户
- 前不久刚换过

1015
01:05:02,975 --> 01:05:07,135
嗯 但我们找不到了
他总是把东西东藏西藏的

1016
01:05:07,563 --> 01:05:10,513
好吧 让我看看...

1017
01:05:10,691 --> 01:05:12,568
我们给他开个新账户

1018
01:05:12,745 --> 01:05:14,997
爸 咱这就去做弥撒

1019
01:05:16,405 --> 01:05:17,823
我们相当虔诚

1020
01:05:18,626 --> 01:05:19,731
是啊

1021
01:05:22,108 --> 01:05:24,121
- 账户是空的
- 是吗？

1022
01:05:24,298 --> 01:05:26,769
噢 爸爸
别老心不在焉！

1023
01:05:27,186 --> 01:05:29,543
我不是告诉你了
不是这个账本吗？

1024
01:05:30,106 --> 01:05:31,180
记住没？

1025
01:05:31,430 --> 01:05:33,338
麻烦你给查下别的账户好吗？

1026
01:05:33,901 --> 01:05:35,184
能不能先看下你的身份证？

1027
01:05:35,330 --> 01:05:36,988
- 好的
- 不 是他的

1028
01:05:37,832 --> 01:05:39,073
爸 你身份证在哪？

1029
01:05:39,438 --> 01:05:40,825
别碰我

1030
01:05:43,995 --> 01:05:45,684
爸爸...

1031
01:05:47,259 --> 01:05:48,989
我要看下你的身份证

1032
01:05:50,011 --> 01:05:51,846
你就为了我的钱

1033
01:05:53,077 --> 01:05:54,422
听到了吧？

1034
01:05:54,599 --> 01:05:57,237
成天嚷着要先去银行再去教堂

1035
01:05:57,425 --> 01:05:58,249
现在又变卦？

1036
01:06:00,376 --> 01:06:02,493
- 那我们走吧
-  嗯 走吧

1037
01:06:02,712 --> 01:06:04,724
- 爸 别墨迹了
- 别碰我

1038
01:06:05,808 --> 01:06:07,498
- 爸...
- 别碰我

1039
01:06:09,041 --> 01:06:09,979
你看到了

1040
01:06:10,156 --> 01:06:12,336
他天天这么对待我

1041
01:06:12,763 --> 01:06:14,880
他才不管有多少人在等他

1042
01:06:17,362 --> 01:06:19,791
他可别落到最恨他的人手里

1043
01:06:27,580 --> 01:06:29,561
- 你拉身上了
- 弱智

1044
01:06:31,688 --> 01:06:33,148
好 现在你使劲嚷嚷吧

1045
01:06:37,569 --> 01:06:42,720
选戏剧课前 我还选过舞蹈课
认识了一个男人

1046
01:06:43,064 --> 01:06:44,243
他叫胡安

1047
01:06:45,431 --> 01:06:48,549
有个女犯人追了他很久

1048
01:06:49,571 --> 01:06:51,969
他们在一起拍拖了几次
他却朝三暮四

1049
01:06:53,992 --> 01:06:56,985
她把他当财产一样

1050
01:06:58,788 --> 01:06:59,998
她发现了我们的事

1051
01:07:00,186 --> 01:07:02,365
妒火中烧

1052
01:07:03,074 --> 01:07:04,138
就是那个欺负你的人？

1053
01:07:04,294 --> 01:07:05,848
嗯 还有她的同僚

1054
01:07:08,851 --> 01:07:10,196
你也让他把你肚子搞大？

1055
01:07:10,342 --> 01:07:12,531
- 是的

1056
01:07:13,689 --> 01:07:14,930
他不想有包袱

1057
01:07:16,640 --> 01:07:17,995
我哥知道吗？

1058
01:07:19,392 --> 01:07:20,289
不知道

1059
01:07:21,134 --> 01:07:22,938
这么说你也欺骗他了

1060
01:07:33,479 --> 01:07:35,773
你的车很漂亮嘛
600块？

1061
01:07:36,712 --> 01:07:37,859
750

1062
01:07:38,349 --> 01:07:39,809
挺阔绰嘛

1063
01:07:40,372 --> 01:07:41,957
要不你也做按摩师？

1064
01:07:42,874 --> 01:07:43,979
这个嘛

1065
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:46,659
真没法想象自己给别人手淫

1066
01:07:51,331 --> 01:07:52,957
怎么会选这一行的？

1067
01:07:53,385 --> 01:07:56,231
因为我擅长嘛
不是吗？

1068
01:07:56,482 --> 01:07:57,305
那是

1069
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:01,268
转过身来 雷蒙

1070
01:08:07,889 --> 01:08:08,858
嘿

1071
01:08:10,047 --> 01:08:12,122
- 我不叫雷蒙

1072
01:08:12,414 --> 01:08:14,041
我叫以色列

1073
01:08:14,948 --> 01:08:16,230
更好点

1074
01:08:17,357 --> 01:08:21,173
哥儿们都叫我西恩
他们觉得我长得像西恩.潘

1075
01:08:23,790 --> 01:08:25,344
可不是嘛 很像

1076
01:08:26,751 --> 01:08:27,815
谢了

1077
01:08:30,682 --> 01:08:31,923
罗伯特

1078
01:08:33,216 --> 01:08:34,707
我可以抚摸你吗？

1079
01:08:36,417 --> 01:08:37,429
不可以

1080
01:08:55,833 --> 01:08:57,188
- 乔治?
-嗨

1081
01:08:57,751 --> 01:09:00,254
跟我来
抱歉让你久等

1082
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:02,714
- 没关系

1083
01:09:02,996 --> 01:09:05,248
- 我们是老朋友
- 嗯 她跟我说了

1084
01:09:05,436 --> 01:09:08,251
有一件事 你俩还在一起吗？

1085
01:09:09,158 --> 01:09:10,295
她怎么说的？

1086
01:09:10,754 --> 01:09:12,453
离开她吧

1087
01:09:18,897 --> 01:09:19,930
这边走

1088
01:09:20,149 --> 01:09:21,702
我带了简历

1089
01:09:21,890 --> 01:09:23,026
好的 我会看的

1090
01:09:23,214 --> 01:09:27,145
我要开会去 艾米利奥会给你讲讲这的情况

1091
01:09:27,489 --> 01:09:29,856
艾米利奥
这位是乔治

1092
01:09:30,065 --> 01:09:33,255
好好待他 他是被推荐过来的
回头见

1093
01:09:37,551 --> 01:09:38,479
嗨

1094
01:09:41,378 --> 01:09:45,684
我在这工作到晚上11点
你接我班  干到次日早上7点

1095
01:09:45,935 --> 01:09:47,217
西服不错嘛

1096
01:09:47,634 --> 01:09:49,438
这些车都需要贴标签 看到没有

1097
01:09:49,793 --> 01:09:53,401
停车位是指定的 这帮家伙逮哪停哪

1098
01:09:54,558 --> 01:09:56,612
这每一层都有摄像头

1099
01:09:57,592 --> 01:09:59,803
但每小时你都得检查一下

1100
01:10:00,929 --> 01:10:02,556
睁大你的眼睛

1101
01:10:03,504 --> 01:10:05,381
小心 别弄脏你的西服

1102
01:10:05,871 --> 01:10:08,572
瞧 那是贡仔罗的车

1103
01:10:10,115 --> 01:10:11,127
挺酷 是吧？

1104
01:10:12,065 --> 01:10:14,046
这狗杂种

1105
01:10:37,184 --> 01:10:38,915
要那个 自己掏钱

1106
01:10:45,432 --> 01:10:46,641
不用找了 爸爸

1107
01:10:57,882 --> 01:11:00,906
面试不成功吗？
让你不愿见我

1108
01:11:01,917 --> 01:11:03,345
相当成功

1109
01:11:04,597 --> 01:11:07,131
以后只给你停车  不用给你倒垃圾了

1110
01:11:08,079 --> 01:11:11,343
虽然我能兼任
他让我干夜班

1111
01:11:12,907 --> 01:11:14,993
对不起
我不知道是这样

1112
01:11:16,849 --> 01:11:18,715
没错
你什么都不知道

1113
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:27,203
乔治 你干什么？

1114
01:11:37,546 --> 01:11:39,423
你干嘛告诉他我是个保洁？

1115
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:43,938
- 他问我的
- 你该闭嘴  让我自己跟他说！

1116
01:11:44,439 --> 01:11:47,285
- 我说了  你是我的朋友啦
- 小时候的玩伴

1117
01:11:47,463 --> 01:11:49,047
我最好的朋友

1118
01:11:49,235 --> 01:11:51,769
生日时还和你上了床
你说了吗？

1119
01:11:52,853 --> 01:11:53,886
我说了很多好话的

1120
01:11:55,325 --> 01:11:56,743
难怪让我干这狗屁活儿

1121
01:11:56,993 --> 01:11:58,056
你没告诉他

1122
01:11:58,807 --> 01:12:01,091
你对金融感兴趣

1123
01:12:02,008 --> 01:12:03,843
你什么都没说 对吗？

1124
01:12:04,824 --> 01:12:06,377
我不想让你难堪

1125
01:12:06,732 --> 01:12:09,099
别管我 乔治
我不在乎的

1126
01:12:10,006 --> 01:12:11,539
你当然不必在乎

1127
01:12:12,237 --> 01:12:15,219
你有好工作  硕士学历  还有旅德的经历

1128
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:17,128
好工作任你挑

1129
01:12:17,315 --> 01:12:19,390
你不喜欢自己的牙  就戴牙套

1130
01:12:19,578 --> 01:12:23,123
你别怨天尤人了
我签了仨月的合同

1131
01:12:23,467 --> 01:12:25,615
工资低得可怜
我也受人剥削呢

1132
01:12:27,961 --> 01:12:30,214
你以为就你可怜？

1133
01:12:32,163 --> 01:12:33,310
你错了

1134
01:12:34,781 --> 01:12:37,450
就你让我觉得自己还有用

1135
01:12:37,596 --> 01:12:38,566
嗯

1136
01:12:39,890 --> 01:12:42,142
但你自己的问题  你得自己面对

1137
01:12:43,268 --> 01:12:45,865
你可以让日子好过些

1138
01:12:46,052 --> 01:12:46,991
让我们俩好过些

1139
01:12:49,566 --> 01:12:52,163
你埋怨你爸  你哥

1140
01:12:53,007 --> 01:12:54,071
还有我

1141
01:12:55,510 --> 01:12:57,877
其实是你自己在折磨自己

1142
01:13:24,080 --> 01:13:26,405
离我远点   别让我看到你

1143
01:13:49,407 --> 01:13:52,150
这畜生
我要给他点颜色看看

1144
01:13:56,613 --> 01:13:59,417
我要让邻居都知道他的丑事
让大家都知道

1145
01:13:59,876 --> 01:14:01,784
西恩 算了吧

1146
01:14:02,837 --> 01:14:04,183
你爸喜欢又怎样？

1147
01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:06,278
这是他的一部分

1148
01:14:06,727 --> 01:14:07,978
你就不能忍受吗？

1149
01:14:11,919 --> 01:14:12,983
我发现我喜欢上了罗伯特

1150
01:14:13,932 --> 01:14:15,006
罗伯特?

1151
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:16,633
那个按摩师

1152
01:14:19,813 --> 01:14:21,867
我无法忍受我爸去他那

1153
01:14:23,817 --> 01:14:24,849
我受不了

1154
01:14:25,725 --> 01:14:27,571
你以前喜欢过别人吗？

1155
01:14:27,748 --> 01:14:28,780
别的男人

1156
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:31,877
有过  我15岁的时候

1157
01:14:32,065 --> 01:14:33,337
翻杂志

1158
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:39,812
《花花公子》女性版   就情不自禁了

1159
01:14:39,989 --> 01:14:40,855
你买的？

1160
01:14:41,032 --> 01:14:42,700
不...  偷的

1161
01:14:45,557 --> 01:14:47,883
就开始手淫  疯狂了一周

1162
01:14:50,395 --> 01:14:51,532
后来杂志就不见了

1163
01:14:52,835 --> 01:14:55,786
妈的 肯定是那狗东西偷走了

1164
01:14:55,964 --> 01:14:57,350
那我呢？

1165
01:14:58,289 --> 01:14:59,227
你什么？

1166
01:14:59,550 --> 01:15:02,116
我们总在一起

1167
01:15:03,169 --> 01:15:04,190
你就没心血澎湃过？

1168
01:15:05,807 --> 01:15:08,382
乔治 我不知道自己是不是

1169
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:12,689
可我知道自己有品味

1170
01:15:14,472 --> 01:15:17,662
这里 这里
妈妈给你亲一亲就好了

1171
01:15:31,238 --> 01:15:32,792
你跟你老爸做这个吗？

1172
01:15:33,678 --> 01:15:34,815
有时候

1173
01:15:35,764 --> 01:15:36,942
为什么呢？

1174
01:15:38,058 --> 01:15:39,559
有助感官记忆

1175
01:15:40,216 --> 01:15:42,166
防止遗忘基本的功能

1176
01:15:43,386 --> 01:15:44,668
你的耳朵

1177
01:15:46,796 --> 01:15:47,901
眼睛

1178
01:15:49,434 --> 01:15:50,612
鼻子

1179
01:15:52,364 --> 01:15:53,573
嘴...

1180
01:15:57,369 --> 01:15:59,423
知道我最喜欢你什么吗？

1181
01:16:01,821 --> 01:16:03,448
当你把我放倒时

1182
01:16:05,335 --> 01:16:06,868
你的温柔

1183
01:16:08,463 --> 01:16:10,090
还有些畏缩

1184
01:16:11,977 --> 01:16:13,301
你英俊的外型

1185
01:16:15,116 --> 01:16:16,638
还有你从外面的世界而来

1186
01:16:19,672 --> 01:16:21,820
是你唤醒了我的柔情

1187
01:16:24,646 --> 01:16:26,106
你让我为你着迷...

1188
01:16:27,878 --> 01:16:29,995
你与我一样茫然  无助

1189
01:16:34,948 --> 01:16:35,980
乔治...

1190
01:16:40,203 --> 01:16:41,548
我怀孕了

1191
01:16:50,808 --> 01:16:51,944
那我为什么还在这里？

1192
01:16:53,247 --> 01:16:55,156
我们第一次 我就怀孕了

1193
01:16:56,136 --> 01:16:57,867
一直都没告诉你

1194
01:17:00,129 --> 01:17:01,933
那产房的事

1195
01:17:02,569 --> 01:17:04,060
两周后

1196
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:08,826
- 恭喜！
- 谢谢你

1197
01:17:11,787 --> 01:17:13,069
你害怕吗？

1198
01:17:14,748 --> 01:17:15,718
不

1199
01:17:17,668 --> 01:17:18,982
我怕

1200
01:17:21,004 --> 01:17:22,256
不必

1201
01:17:40,837 --> 01:17:42,860
今天谁得听话？

1202
01:17:43,350 --> 01:17:44,935
- 你
- 没错 我听话

1203
01:17:45,122 --> 01:17:47,229
- 你要听话
- 我不听

1204
01:17:47,416 --> 01:17:49,887
你要听

1205
01:17:55,278 --> 01:17:56,811
-给你
-谢谢

1206
01:17:56,988 --> 01:17:59,314
- 不  是给开户人的
- 我拿给他看

1207
01:18:01,086 --> 01:18:04,496
老爸  甭担心你的账户了

1208
01:18:05,789 --> 01:18:06,790
还有别的事吗？

1209
01:18:06,967 --> 01:18:07,937
嗯

1210
01:18:10,272 --> 01:18:11,284
你看  我爸...

1211
01:18:12,295 --> 01:18:14,235
我不能每次都带他来这

1212
01:18:16,362 --> 01:18:19,281
必须有人做他的代理

1213
01:18:19,459 --> 01:18:21,638
处理他的账户  你看呢？

1214
01:18:25,996 --> 01:18:28,113
我告诉过你 别在这吸烟

1215
01:18:29,031 --> 01:18:30,272
没点着

1216
01:18:31,325 --> 01:18:33,024
你现在不该上班吗？

1217
01:18:33,379 --> 01:18:35,454
- 辞职了
- 辞职还是被炒了？

1218
01:18:36,330 --> 01:18:37,925
我早料到了

1219
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:41,168
货车和你上交的钱  就甭指望了

1220
01:18:43,295 --> 01:18:45,161
你不该那么对乔治

1221
01:18:45,725 --> 01:18:48,363
乔治怎么能干出那样的事呢？

1222
01:18:48,540 --> 01:18:50,000
他是个正人君子

1223
01:18:51,678 --> 01:18:54,035
你这混蛋才能干出那种事来

1224
01:18:55,151 --> 01:18:56,892
是你儿子干的

1225
01:19:00,969 --> 01:19:02,105
你这混蛋

1226
01:19:02,356 --> 01:19:05,275
你动我根毫毛试试
我让所有人都知道

1227
01:19:06,047 --> 01:19:07,329
你到底想怎么样？

1228
01:19:07,507 --> 01:19:09,060
- 你是同志吗？
- 不是

1229
01:19:10,082 --> 01:19:11,219
- 同性恋
- 不是

1230
01:19:11,886 --> 01:19:13,836
- 同性恋？双性恋？
- 不是 不是

1231
01:19:15,087 --> 01:19:16,120
不是

1232
01:19:16,662 --> 01:19:20,134
你干嘛不找个女按摩师？

1233
01:19:20,311 --> 01:19:23,158
-像个正常人一样
-我不想向你解释

1234
01:19:23,690 --> 01:19:25,181
不和我说？那向我妈说去怎么样？

1235
01:19:25,358 --> 01:19:27,370
给我滚出去

1236
01:19:27,548 --> 01:19:28,934
我不在乎 老爸

1237
01:19:29,112 --> 01:19:32,375
我在这过腻歪了   你们都互相欺骗

1238
01:19:34,440 --> 01:19:35,931
以后别去行吗？

1239
01:19:58,308 --> 01:19:59,402
看起来不像

1240
01:20:00,247 --> 01:20:03,094
爸  这像你的签名吗？

1241
01:20:04,042 --> 01:20:05,878
你得的是老年痴呆 不是四肢不能动弹

1242
01:20:06,545 --> 01:20:08,766
不是老年痴呆
是血管性痴呆

1243
01:20:08,985 --> 01:20:10,372
和保拉进行得怎么样了？

1244
01:20:10,789 --> 01:20:11,654
还好

1245
01:20:11,831 --> 01:20:13,781
还好？没别的可说了吗？

1246
01:20:13,959 --> 01:20:16,534
-打住
-这不许有人说话吗？

1247
01:20:25,574 --> 01:20:27,034
你认识这个吧？

1248
01:20:27,253 --> 01:20:28,150
不知道

1249
01:20:28,848 --> 01:20:30,903
这是官方认可签名卡

1250
01:20:31,247 --> 01:20:33,614
也不算卡 就是一张纸

1251
01:20:33,895 --> 01:20:36,888
拿它就可以从账户取钱了

1252
01:20:37,795 --> 01:20:39,067
或存钱

1253
01:20:40,224 --> 01:20:42,299
- 谁的授权？
- 爸爸的

1254
01:20:43,530 --> 01:20:46,825
我告诉过你 他账户是空的
养老金都归我了

1255
01:20:58,211 --> 01:20:59,525
乔治

1256
01:21:00,088 --> 01:21:01,412
爸爸还有另一个账户

1257
01:21:04,999 --> 01:21:07,283
一个存折
那时你太小 不记得了

1258
01:21:08,513 --> 01:21:11,141
我们来马德里时
妈妈坚持要买

1259
01:21:11,328 --> 01:21:13,904
人身保险  以防万一

1260
01:21:14,081 --> 01:21:16,709
她担心这太乱

1261
01:21:16,897 --> 01:21:18,481
所以就有了这个...

1262
01:21:19,128 --> 01:21:23,226
我一直记得 可我不知道保险还有效吗
不知道有多少

1263
01:21:23,580 --> 01:21:25,134
也不知道他领了没

1264
01:21:26,052 --> 01:21:27,188
其实领了

1265
01:21:28,940 --> 01:21:30,003
他领了

1266
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:35,081
我猜他没告诉过你

1267
01:21:36,864 --> 01:21:38,178
有多少？

1268
01:21:39,440 --> 01:21:42,850
开始时不多
但爸爸把它存到了银行...

1269
01:21:45,144 --> 01:21:46,770
七年一直没动

1270
01:21:47,062 --> 01:21:48,647
现在是100,000 欧元

1271
01:21:52,901 --> 01:21:54,184
如果他在这签字

1272
01:21:54,372 --> 01:21:55,466
就是咱俩的了

1273
01:21:58,824 --> 01:22:00,378
你什么时候知道的？

1274
01:22:02,338 --> 01:22:04,246
我并不知道 我猜到的

1275
01:22:04,423 --> 01:22:05,560
那不是猜

1276
01:22:06,894 --> 01:22:08,698
你要么早就知道要么不知道

1277
01:22:09,918 --> 01:22:11,618
你干嘛没告诉我？

1278
01:22:11,899 --> 01:22:13,078
你说对了

1279
01:22:13,849 --> 01:22:15,340
这样你就可以独吞了

1280
01:22:17,228 --> 01:22:19,584
但不管怎么说 这是好消息
我们有钱了

1281
01:22:20,460 --> 01:22:22,295
- 这不是你的
- 当然不是

1282
01:22:22,441 --> 01:22:23,943
是咱俩的

1283
01:22:24,110 --> 01:22:25,257
咱俩的？

1284
01:22:27,175 --> 01:22:29,751
是我的
我和爸爸的

1285
01:22:29,928 --> 01:22:33,567
他要钱干嘛？
我们把他送到养老院

1286
01:22:33,755 --> 01:22:35,486
他已经给我了
你听到没有？

1287
01:22:36,153 --> 01:22:37,540
他已经给我了

1288
01:22:38,030 --> 01:22:40,845
是吗？给你了？
怎么没在你手上？

1289
01:22:41,022 --> 01:22:43,170
你怎么没有？
咱问问老爸吧

1290
01:22:43,358 --> 01:22:46,059
为什么没把钱给乔治呢？

1291
01:22:46,663 --> 01:22:49,197
- 他是那个混儿子  我是乖儿子
- 离他远点

1292
01:22:52,336 --> 01:22:54,473
没晚饭 睡觉去
你们俩

1293
01:23:00,260 --> 01:23:01,647
对不起 乔治

1294
01:23:02,596 --> 01:23:03,733
真的对不起

1295
01:23:06,871 --> 01:23:08,529
我真他妈的自私

1296
01:23:11,532 --> 01:23:12,815
我必须要相信

1297
01:23:12,992 --> 01:23:15,046
当我出去时  我有盼头

1298
01:23:17,830 --> 01:23:19,561
我不必一切重新开始

1299
01:23:20,583 --> 01:23:21,646
在我这个年纪

1300
01:23:23,888 --> 01:23:25,098
尤其是现在

1301
01:23:26,078 --> 01:23:28,674
和保拉  还有我们的未来

1302
01:23:30,395 --> 01:23:31,781
你能理解我吗？

1303
01:23:36,234 --> 01:23:37,516
你要当爸爸了

1304
01:23:40,415 --> 01:23:41,875
保拉 怀孕了

1305
01:24:01,290 --> 01:24:02,635
你能原谅我吗？

1306
01:24:06,650 --> 01:24:07,786
怎么了？

1307
01:24:11,790 --> 01:24:13,709
因为我向你隐瞒了一些事

1308
01:24:32,081 --> 01:24:33,572
现在打算做什么？

1309
01:24:34,480 --> 01:24:36,356
不知道
正在想呢

1310
01:24:37,545 --> 01:24:39,485
你也不小了 该知道做什么了

1311
01:24:40,850 --> 01:24:43,760
嗯  有些事  人不能一下子就发现

1312
01:24:47,357 --> 01:24:48,848
你什么时候发现的 爸爸

1313
01:24:51,497 --> 01:24:52,842
发现什么？

1314
01:24:53,613 --> 01:24:57,680
你是一下子发现的 还是慢慢意识到的

1315
01:24:57,930 --> 01:24:59,067
我是说

1316
01:25:00,464 --> 01:25:01,538
当时怎么想的

1317
01:25:02,873 --> 01:25:04,259
"我喜欢按摩"?

1318
01:25:06,522 --> 01:25:10,234
"我喜欢手淫"? "我喜欢男人"?
一样一样发现的?

1319
01:25:12,403 --> 01:25:13,685
住口 以色列

1320
01:25:14,207 --> 01:25:16,355
还是一下子发现的？
你觉得

1321
01:25:17,689 --> 01:25:20,682
“我喜欢男人给我按摩和手淫”

1322
01:25:20,786 --> 01:25:22,517
以色列 够了 闭嘴

1323
01:25:22,705 --> 01:25:24,050
你想让我闭嘴？

1324
01:25:24,436 --> 01:25:25,541
那他呢？

1325
01:25:26,771 --> 01:25:27,877
闭嘴

1326
01:25:30,212 --> 01:25:31,391
吃饭

1327
01:25:52,724 --> 01:25:53,861
安东尼奥

1328
01:25:55,821 --> 01:25:57,135
过来 我的宝贝儿

1329
01:26:00,096 --> 01:26:02,536
我可得轻点 里面有宝宝呢

1330
01:26:03,266 --> 01:26:04,403
恭喜你

1331
01:26:06,394 --> 01:26:07,406
谢谢

1332
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:09,700
我们成功了

1333
01:26:19,897 --> 01:26:21,180
我们来庆祝吧

1334
01:26:26,748 --> 01:26:28,521
- 你和乔治聊过吗？
- 没怎么聊过

1335
01:26:28,906 --> 01:26:31,451
他寡言少语的   一直沉默

1336
01:26:32,566 --> 01:26:36,727
我问过他  他别别扭扭的
他觉得丢人  不愿意聊这个

1337
01:26:36,977 --> 01:26:40,585
开始我有点气急败坏

1338
01:26:41,846 --> 01:26:44,349
我们是兄弟  可我们截然不同

1339
01:26:44,839 --> 01:26:45,913
让我看看

1340
01:26:46,132 --> 01:26:47,550
- 脱了吧
- 等等

1341
01:26:48,499 --> 01:26:49,636
不会有事的

1342
01:26:49,782 --> 01:26:52,075
你怀孕了 我们也可以做爱的

1343
01:26:52,253 --> 01:26:54,307
我知道  也不是那个啦

1344
01:26:54,724 --> 01:26:55,829
不是那个啦

1345
01:27:00,010 --> 01:27:01,512
那怎么了？

1346
01:27:04,296 --> 01:27:06,027
你为什么带我来这？

1347
01:27:07,184 --> 01:27:08,634
我们不能在一起了

1348
01:27:10,417 --> 01:27:13,044
真是新闻啊 我们小的时候你就一直那么说

1349
01:27:13,441 --> 01:27:14,650
嗯 但这次不同

1350
01:27:15,255 --> 01:27:16,287
怎么了？

1351
01:27:16,464 --> 01:27:17,674
我以前是恐惧

1352
01:27:18,039 --> 01:27:20,604
我觉得我们走的路不同

1353
01:27:21,271 --> 01:27:22,658
迟早有一天

1354
01:27:22,804 --> 01:27:24,744
你会甩了我
-那现在怎么想的？

1355
01:27:25,546 --> 01:27:29,092
现在我不仅这么想
我是完全相信

1356
01:27:29,342 --> 01:27:30,729
你会离开我的

1357
01:27:32,334 --> 01:27:33,648
我遇到了另一个女孩

1358
01:27:34,357 --> 01:27:35,744
她就在那里

1359
01:27:42,803 --> 01:27:44,607
她在监狱里工作？

1360
01:27:46,463 --> 01:27:49,716
100,000 欧元呢 想想吧
我们可以做生意

1361
01:27:49,904 --> 01:27:52,824
我一直想开个音像店
我们一起开吧

1362
01:27:56,275 --> 01:27:57,339
怎么了？

1363
01:27:58,183 --> 01:28:00,404
你都不知道我怎么想的呢

1364
01:28:00,581 --> 01:28:03,157
你早点说嘛！ 这不能怪我！

1365
01:28:03,334 --> 01:28:04,398
当然不怪

1366
01:28:05,493 --> 01:28:07,401
那就不开音像店

1367
01:28:08,339 --> 01:28:09,768
你想做什么？

1368
01:28:10,435 --> 01:28:13,000
安东尼奥 你想开音像店  那就开

1369
01:28:13,177 --> 01:28:14,804
你想纹身

1370
01:28:14,950 --> 01:28:16,796
纹一个好了
- 那好

1371
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:19,580
但你不想要

1372
01:28:20,935 --> 01:28:21,947
不想

1373
01:28:23,584 --> 01:28:25,137
你想要什么？

1374
01:28:26,399 --> 01:28:27,713
你到底要什么？

1375
01:28:28,557 --> 01:28:30,017
我就在你面前

1376
01:28:31,237 --> 01:28:34,157
说吧  你到底想要什么

1377
01:28:35,450 --> 01:28:36,836
然后满足你

1378
01:28:40,945 --> 01:28:42,300
你想要什么？

1379
01:28:43,270 --> 01:28:44,803
她需要我

1380
01:28:46,158 --> 01:28:47,410
不止这些吧

1381
01:28:49,255 --> 01:28:50,402
对我来说 就这些

1382
01:28:50,996 --> 01:28:52,206
目前是这样

1383
01:28:52,946 --> 01:28:56,314
肯定还有别的原因
不止这个吧

1384
01:28:57,962 --> 01:29:00,005
你  像是老天对我的施舍

1385
01:29:02,028 --> 01:29:03,561
我不禁这么想

1386
01:29:06,689 --> 01:29:08,149
和她在一起 感觉就不同了

1387
01:29:12,184 --> 01:29:13,363
时间问题

1388
01:29:15,771 --> 01:29:17,085
什么时间？

1389
01:29:18,899 --> 01:29:20,557
你让我如此意外

1390
01:29:49,201 --> 01:29:51,672
- 你在干什么？
- 我爸要撵我出门了

1391
01:29:52,026 --> 01:29:53,444
我会劝劝你爸的

1392
01:29:53,622 --> 01:29:56,687
- 他不会的
- 没关系  反正我也不想留了

1393
01:29:57,313 --> 01:29:58,804
你为什么还要和他过？

1394
01:30:01,140 --> 01:30:03,465
一起走吧  妈  求你了

1395
01:30:06,145 --> 01:30:08,647
要不咱俩把他撵走

1396
01:30:15,998 --> 01:30:17,656
我早就知道你爸的事

1397
01:30:21,493 --> 01:30:23,547
一开始  我以为更糟糕

1398
01:30:24,830 --> 01:30:26,947
我不知道他去那 是做按摩

1399
01:30:27,124 --> 01:30:28,625
还有手淫

1400
01:30:30,919 --> 01:30:31,931
这日子真糟

1401
01:30:33,318 --> 01:30:34,350
现在好多了

1402
01:30:35,935 --> 01:30:37,947
以前是的

1403
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:40,554
你爸让我生不如死

1404
01:30:40,731 --> 01:30:42,358
你和他谈过吗？

1405
01:30:43,380 --> 01:30:44,443
没必要

1406
01:30:47,311 --> 01:30:48,770
他已经习惯了

1407
01:30:51,033 --> 01:30:52,587
我也就想开了

1408
01:30:54,651 --> 01:30:57,571
-你现在也该想开点
-这他妈算什么

1409
01:30:57,748 --> 01:30:59,166
- 家丑不可外扬
- 这算家吗？

1410
01:30:59,344 --> 01:31:00,376
这就是家

1411
01:31:01,815 --> 01:31:03,202
太无厘头了

1412
01:31:04,182 --> 01:31:05,840
我可不会用那词

1413
01:31:19,280 --> 01:31:21,397
如果你告诉任何人 我就给你踢出去

1414
01:31:27,872 --> 01:31:29,082
我相信乔治

1415
01:31:41,584 --> 01:31:42,689
乔治 在哪？

1416
01:31:44,649 --> 01:31:45,619
我不知道

1417
01:32:03,741 --> 01:32:06,067
保拉 出来后想做什么？

1418
01:32:07,954 --> 01:32:09,904
攻读语言学士学位

1419
01:32:10,811 --> 01:32:13,240
尽管她想做些社会工作

1420
01:32:14,283 --> 01:32:17,130
帮同病相怜的女人

1421
01:32:17,317 --> 01:32:18,589
再说一遍...

1422
01:32:19,299 --> 01:32:22,771
攻读语言学士学位
尽管她想...

1423
01:32:25,868 --> 01:32:26,806
我怎么说的？

1424
01:32:29,037 --> 01:32:30,174
我是怎么说的？

1425
01:32:32,374 --> 01:32:34,293
我告诉你只和她上床

1426
01:33:05,157 --> 01:33:06,502
我他妈也该搞一下

1427
01:34:24,997 --> 01:34:26,384
老兄...

1428
01:34:27,395 --> 01:34:28,469
悠着点

1429
01:34:30,596 --> 01:34:32,338
那衣服对你很重要吗？

1430
01:34:33,005 --> 01:34:35,330
不是衣服   是它的含义

1431
01:34:35,852 --> 01:34:37,134
什么含义？

1432
01:34:38,219 --> 01:34:40,961
距离感的遗憾

1433
01:34:41,806 --> 01:34:43,192
什么距离感？

1434
01:34:43,755 --> 01:34:45,174
得到的和想得到的东西

1435
01:34:48,687 --> 01:34:49,970
为何偏是那套呢？

1436
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:53,515
因为它就在眼皮下

1437
01:34:54,329 --> 01:34:55,757
而且很好看

1438
01:34:57,425 --> 01:34:59,083
又没人买

1439
01:34:59,511 --> 01:35:01,982
它不停降价 还没卖出去

1440
01:35:02,608 --> 01:35:04,485
- 乔治
- 什么？

1441
01:35:07,102 --> 01:35:09,177
你干嘛从不让我给你买东西呢？

1442
01:35:10,647 --> 01:35:12,972
我想把它买下来作为礼物送你

1443
01:35:15,026 --> 01:35:16,976
你就像我的女朋友

1444
01:35:17,644 --> 01:35:18,853
除了不做爱

1445
01:35:19,583 --> 01:35:20,938
也不想

1446
01:35:27,309 --> 01:35:29,489
我要自己买

1447
01:35:31,240 --> 01:35:32,523
你没钱啊

1448
01:35:33,399 --> 01:35:35,755
我不想买了  不用钱买

1449
01:35:37,507 --> 01:35:38,863
你想干什么？

1450
01:35:40,740 --> 01:35:42,231
我们换下位置 好么？

1451
01:35:58,872 --> 01:36:00,530
车有气囊吗？

1452
01:36:01,375 --> 01:36:02,438
没有

1453
01:36:25,972 --> 01:36:28,600
- 去哪里？
- 面试

1454
01:36:29,517 --> 01:36:31,290
- 又一个？
- 是的

1455
01:36:33,167 --> 01:36:35,013
哪弄的行头？

1456
01:36:36,233 --> 01:36:37,369
我不想要妈妈的钱

1457
01:36:37,484 --> 01:36:38,735
我没打算给你

1458
01:36:38,839 --> 01:36:41,832
我知道 但我还得说我不要
你留着吧

1459
01:36:42,009 --> 01:36:43,114
当然我会的

1460
01:36:43,292 --> 01:36:44,501
爸爸的你也留着吧

1461
01:36:44,658 --> 01:36:46,701
不 你留着爸爸的

1462
01:36:47,442 --> 01:36:49,725
他做轮椅   植物人一个  是你的错

1463
01:36:49,944 --> 01:36:52,520
你得照顾他
-你认为那是我的错

1464
01:37:01,320 --> 01:37:03,124
快吃  爸爸
我们要走了

1465
01:37:03,718 --> 01:37:05,251
干什么呢？

1466
01:37:06,158 --> 01:37:07,430
你傻啊？

1467
01:37:10,256 --> 01:37:11,507
算了 算了

1468
01:37:11,685 --> 01:37:13,833
再签一张吧
幸亏还有备用的

1469
01:37:16,596 --> 01:37:17,868
- 安东尼奥
- 干什么？

1470
01:37:23,791 --> 01:37:25,177
你想起我名字了！

1471
01:37:25,949 --> 01:37:26,981
让我瞧瞧

1472
01:37:29,327 --> 01:37:31,997

救救我...

你在这干什么？
你不能离我远点吗？

1479
01:38:32,505 --> 01:38:35,216
当然可以  总得排队吧  爸爸

1480
01:38:36,582 --> 01:38:37,823

我已经来了一会了  来花你的钱

1482
01:38:45,768 --> 01:38:47,708
你这是怎么了？

1483
01:38:48,438 --> 01:38:49,720
有其父必有其子

1484
01:38:51,847 --> 01:38:53,797
你不是同性恋  以色列

1485
01:38:54,631 --> 01:38:57,207
我把你养大  家长最清楚自己的孩子了

1486
01:38:58,291 --> 01:38:59,709
爷爷没发现你同性恋？

1487
01:39:02,118 --> 01:39:03,328
懂点礼貌  以色列

1488
01:39:04,026 --> 01:39:05,204
别跟我没大没小的

1489
01:39:10,574 --> 01:39:12,232
你要是以后不来  我就不来

1490
01:39:12,691 --> 01:39:16,726
要不这样吧
你一三五来  我二四六

1491
01:39:18,228 --> 01:39:19,500
免得尴尬

1499
01:39:56,600 --> 01:39:57,955
没有  非常出色

1500
01:39:58,164 --> 01:40:00,239
大材小用了吧

1501

没有啦

1502
01:40:03,388 --> 01:40:04,555
请理解我们

1503
01:40:05,223 --> 01:40:07,517
我不希望你把这当跳板

1504
01:40:07,840 --> 01:40:11,135
- 我要稳定的员工
- 学位是我自学的

1505
01:40:12,146 --> 01:40:14,201
保洁员还是有空自学点东西的

1506
01:40:14,972 --> 01:40:17,297
是的  有亲戚吗？

1507
01:40:18,444 --> 01:40:19,998
嗯  我有一个女友

1508
01:40:20,186 --> 01:40:21,093
那不算家人

1509
01:40:21,333 --> 01:40:23,658
其实我们是夫妻
她怀孕了

1510
01:40:24,221 --> 01:40:25,649
怀了个女孩

1511
01:40:26,525 --> 01:40:30,300
她在国外工作
就快回来了

1512
01:40:35,910 --> 01:40:38,308
如果你不在监狱里  你还会注意到我吗？

1513
01:40:39,153 --> 01:40:40,675
也许不会

1514
01:40:42,458 --> 01:40:44,960
你出来后想和我在一起吗？

1515
01:40:47,640 --> 01:40:49,694
好   就这样

1516
01:40:49,694 --> 01:40:51,217
还有别的事吗？

01:40:51,571 --> 01:40:53,104
能穿套装吗？

1518
01:40:53,761 --> 01:40:54,772
随你

1522
01:41:12,373 --> 01:41:14,323
我需要点变化

1523
01:41:14,532 --> 01:41:16,409
还做保洁？

1524
01:41:16,721 --> 01:41:18,598
这也算变化？

1525
01:41:18,775 --> 01:41:19,787
是的

1526
01:41:29,776 --> 01:41:31,225
我更喜欢另一个楼顶

1527
01:41:33,081 --> 01:41:34,322
你在找什么？

1528
01:41:34,990 --> 01:41:37,002
