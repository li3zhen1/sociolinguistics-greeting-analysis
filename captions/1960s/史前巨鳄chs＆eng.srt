1
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:32,530
史前巨鳄

2
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:53,250
替海獭贴标签真的有钱赚吗
They actually pay you for this, to tag beaver?

3
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,710
你猜
Imagine.

4
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,000
你在讽刺我吗
Was that, like, sarcastic?

5
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:02,430
你们渔猎局都瞧不起乡下警长
'Cause I know what you Fish and Game guys think of county sheriffs.

6
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:06,430
老爱说些刺耳的话
We know you like to give these one-word, sarcastic answers.

7
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,640
是啊
Gee.

8
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:10,520
你问我
You ask me,

9
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:13,400
动物干什么是它们的事
what an animal does in the wild is his own business.

10
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,230
只要不要影响人类就行
So long as he doesn't do it to man.

11
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,860
我想这句话是马克吐温说的
I think Mark Twain said that.

12
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:21,820
我想不是吧
Yeah, I think he didn't.

13
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:25,200
不过既然是你说的就算是吧
But since you said it, I guess we're covered.

14
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,550
这些人说话都带刺
Everyone's a comedian, sarcastic.

15
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,680
# I'm sleepin'

16
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,180
# And right in the middle of a good dream #

17
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:13,180
# And all at once I wake up #

18
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:17,060
# From something that keeps knocking at my brain #

19
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,020
# Before I go insane #

20
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:21,940
# I hold my pillow to my head... #

21
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,890
Aah! Aah!

22
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:01,650
# So what am I so afraid of?. #

23
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,150
# I'm afraid that I'm not sure of... #

24
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,610
救命
Help!

25
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,240
# I think I love you #

26
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:14,360
# Isn't that what life is made of?. #

27
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,080
啊
Aah ha!

28
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,280
别松手
Ohh! Don't let go!

29
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,740
噢 不
Oh ho ho!

30
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,700
啊
Aah!

31
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,920
我的天呀
Aw, Jesus Christ.

32
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:28,770
凯莉
Kelly?

33
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:31,530
柯文
Hey, Kevin.

34
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,610
嗨
Hi.

35
00:07:32,640 --> 00:07:35,950
我能跟你谈谈吗
Listen, uh, could I steal you for a minute?

36
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,380
你在做什么?
What are you doing?

37
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,960
我在静坐
Heavy breathing, meditating.

38
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:50,970
静坐?
Meditating?

39
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,260
对 为了减轻压力
Yes. To relieve stress.

40
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:55,930
你教我要靠呼吸放松
Remember, Myra, you're the one who taught me all about breathing.

41
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,470
干嘛呀? 你在生小孩吗
Yes, but you're doing Lamaze. are you giving birth?

42
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:01,180
深呼吸才能放松心情
If you're upset, long, deep breaths.

43
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,400
我被柯文甩掉
Kevin dumped me.

44
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:08,230
我知道了
I know.

45
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,440
他跟你说的?
He told you?

46
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:15,440
我有第一手消息
Well, I sort of had, uh, inside information.

47
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,330
你?
You?

48
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,710
那是在你之前
It started before you, Kelly.

49
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:23,710
我绝对不会...
I never would have--

50
00:08:23,740 --> 00:08:24,420
你?
You?

51
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:27,170
那只是一夜情 而且我们觉得这事就这么过去了
It was just a quick thing that we thought was over,

52
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,050
结果却没有
and...it's not over.

53
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:32,090
你跟柯文
You and Kevin.

54
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,920
我该怎么说
I--l wish I could say something to...

55
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:38,970
人都要随心所欲
the heart wants what the heart wants.

56
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,250
"缅因州渔猎局长"

57
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:52,150
基奥警长
Sheriff Keough?

58
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,190
是
Yeah.

59
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:55,860
我是渔猎局的杰克·威尔斯
Fish and Game. Jack Wells.

60
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,700
最近会有熊出来伤人吗
Any recent bear attacks?

61
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:59,030
没有
This was no bear.

62
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:01,080
熊不会在水底吃人
Bears don't attack people underwater.

63
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,910
也许是一只食人海獭
Probably a beaver, then.

64
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:07,910
你真是尖酸刻薄
Ah, a whole sentence sarcastic.

65
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,680
他被咬成一半?
That the way he came out of the water?

66
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:21,180
嗯
Yeah.

67
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:35,690
嘿
Hey.

68
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:38,160
柯文 近来如何? 怎么样
Hey, Kevin, what's going on? What's happening?

69
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:40,120
你的家人好吗?
How's it goin'? How's your family? Good?

70
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,950
棒呆了 幸会
It's great. So nice to see you.

71
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:43,080
快给我滚
Fuck off.

72
00:09:43,110 --> 00:09:44,580
这是公事
This is business.

73
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,790
缅因州出了意外
There was an accident in Maine.

74
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,250
有人在湖底被咬死
Some guy got killed by something in a lake.

75
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:53,090
大概是只熊 他们找到一颗牙齿
Probably a bear, but they found a tooth.

76
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,130
牙齿?
A tooth?

77
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,670
只是碎片
A fragment of a tooth,

78
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:57,970
很大一只熊的牙齿
one they say couldn't have come from any bear.

79
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,220
很古老自远古的恐龙
Evidently it looks prehistoric, like maybe a dinosaur.

80
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:05,430
原来是这样 他可能是被恐龙咬死的
Oh, well, then I'm sure that that's what it was. He was killed by a dinosaur.

81
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,230
还有其他事吗
Is there anything else?

82
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,640
我派你去调查
I, uh, want you to go there.

83
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:11,440
什么?
What?

84
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:16,110
也许是空穴来风 不过这是古生物学家的工作
It's probably nothing, but you're a paleontologist. This is what we do.

85
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:17,490
你这是什么意思
What do you mean, this is what we do?

86
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,490
我要你查明真相
I'd like you to check out this tooth.

87
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,320
我不是田野调查员
I'm not a field person.

88
00:10:21,350 --> 00:10:23,870
这次我希望你去
Well, on this one, I would like you to be.

89
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:28,030
你要我去缅因州看一颗牙
You want me to go to Maine to look at a tooth?

90
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:32,000
这是蜜拉的点子 对吧?
Oh, this was Myra's idea, wasn't it?

91
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:33,790
当然
Oh, of course.

92
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,420
让我离开一阵子冷静一下
Get me out of the office for a few days, wait till I cool off...

93
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:37,920
不是这样的
it has nothing to do with that.

94
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:40,550
我不做调查 也不去缅因州
I don't do field work, and even if I did, Maine?

95
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,840
我对树木会过敏
I'm allergic to timber.

96
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:43,850
- 凯莉 - 我不去缅因州
- Kelly. - I am not going to Maine.

97
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,390
我死也不去
I'm not going to Maine.

98
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,260
想都别想
It's ridiculous.

99
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:57,030
飞越山头会有点颠簸
It's gonna be rough as we go over these mountains.

100
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,990
没关系 谢谢你
Yeah, that's fine. Thank you.

101
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:01,150
我只想说一声
We're doing the best we can.

102
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:05,910
别跟我说话
Could you not talk to me?

103
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,200
谢谢你
Thank you.

104
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,210
他狂叫着就扑上来
Just came up screaming.

105
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,380
他说了些什么
What did he say?

106
00:11:19,410 --> 00:11:22,130
他只咽了一口气就挂了
Just kind of gurgled. He was pretty much dead.

107
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,890
你什么都没看到
You didn't see anything?

108
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,800
之前湖面很平静
The lake was calm until up he came.

109
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,100
牙齿在里面
The tooth is in here.

110
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,430
这里是停尸间
Oh, that's-- that's the morgue.

111
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,640
是的
Yes.

112
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,980
里面有尸体吗
Well, is the dead guy in there?

113
00:11:34,010 --> 00:11:36,310
所以这里才叫做停尸间
That's where they keep them.

114
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:41,200
你要我把牙齿拿出来吗
Look...you want me to bring the tooth out here?

115
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:42,530
不用
No.

116
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,070
不
No. Let's...

117
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,650
你先请
After you.

118
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:50,450
这是爬虫类 并不是化石
This is reptilian. And this is not a fossil.

119
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,710
你真的是从他身上拔下来的
You really pulled this out of this guy?

120
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,290
没错
Yes, I did.

121
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,880
我要用显微镜观察
I'll need to get a microscopic look at it.

122
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:57,880
尽管用
There you go.

123
00:11:57,910 --> 00:11:59,080
太好了
Great.

124
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,550
也许我应该看看
Maybe I should see--

125
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,920
最好不要
I wouldn't.

126
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,930
我又不是没看过死人
I can deal with dead men--bodies.

127
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,740
攻击持续多久?
How long did this attack go on for?

128
00:12:26,770 --> 00:12:29,580
几秒钟 八秒 最多十秒钟
Seconds. 8 maybe 10.

129
00:12:29,610 --> 00:12:32,540
他上来就是这样
Oh, and, uh, this is how he came up to the boat?

130
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:33,750
是的
Yes.

131
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,670
我想去看那座湖
I'd like to see this lake.

132
00:12:40,660 --> 00:12:43,510
方圆25里都没人住
Nobody lives within 25 miles of it,

133
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:46,720
除了住湖畔的一对老夫妇
except some old couple who live right on the lake.

134
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:50,680
学生偶尔会跑来裸泳
Teenagers trek in every once in a while to skinny-dip.

135
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,680
没有人失踪过
None have disappeared.

136
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:54,730
也没发生不寻常的事
None have spotted anything unusual.

137
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:56,520
问过那对老夫妇了吗
Did you talk to the old couple?

138
00:12:56,550 --> 00:12:57,520
还没有
Not yet.

139
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,100
我们还有什么支援
What kind of backup do we have?

140
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,900
我们?
We?

141
00:13:01,010 --> 00:13:01,940
怎么了
What?

142
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:06,320
什么鬼博物馆会派人来这儿
I'm a little unclear as to why the museum would send somebody here.

143
00:13:06,350 --> 00:13:07,740
你对博物馆有意见?
You gotta thing against museums?

144
00:13:07,770 --> 00:13:09,320
我没有意见
No, I got nothing against museums.

145
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,700
你有去过吗?
Ever been in one?

146
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,540
那是什么
What is that?

147
00:13:18,570 --> 00:13:20,750
轻型气压式火炮枪
Lightweight forward-area air-device unit.

148
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,550
只要一枪就能轰掉这怪物
Whatever's out there, one shot with this, it's dead.

149
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,010
你带这玩意干嘛
Why exactly would you have that?

150
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,170
天啊
God.

151
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:37,060
有蚊子 我最恨蚊于
Mosquitoes. I gotta thing about mosquitoes.

152
00:13:37,090 --> 00:13:38,690
准备好了就走吧
If you're all set, let's go.

153
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:39,940
救星来了
We're saved.

154
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:44,230
纽约博物馆派人来支援我们
A museum in New York just sent us some additional backup.

155
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:46,360
我是凯莉·斯科特
Kelly Scott.

156
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,110
杰克·威尔斯
Jack Wells.

157
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,320
嗨
Hi.

158
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:51,370
是什么鬼博物馆派你来的吗
Uh, some museum sent you, huh?

159
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,370
你们都对博物馆不爽吗
What, are we all museum bigots in Maine?

160
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,830
她讲话很冲
She's rude sarcastic.

161
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,660
你们俩很速配
You two should get along.

162
00:13:56,690 --> 00:13:58,670
女士 你不能跟来
I'm afraid I can't let you go with us, ma'am.

163
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,920
基奥警长说可以
Sheriff Keough said I could.

164
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:02,210
渔猎局的权力比警长大
Unfortunately, Fish and Game supersedes the sheriff.

165
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,210
这是什么道理?
Why do you have to supersede? Maybe I might be of--

166
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,880
女士 这可不是探险之旅
Ma'am, look, this isn't some kind of fact-finding expedition.

167
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:09,010
我知道
Yes, I know that.

168
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,430
也不是远足
It's not a science trip.

169
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,760
别这么傲慢 好吗
Could you be a little more condescending?

170
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:13,760
我不是三岁小孩
'Cause I'm not real great with subtlety.

171
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,310
湖中有个怪物咬死人
Something in that lake killed somebody, right?

172
00:14:17,340 --> 00:14:19,350
我很感激你想帮忙
I appreciate you're trying to help.

173
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,020
谢谢你带一瓶杀虫剂来
I'm really glad that you brought the raid.

174
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:22,940
这样好多了
Now, that's better.

175
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,110
女士 没用的
Ma'am, it's not gonna work--

176
00:14:24,140 --> 00:14:27,530
你再叫我女士我就告你 在今日的法律规定是可行的
If you call me "ma'am" one more time, I'll sue you, and with today's laws, it's possible.

177
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:28,860
她很高竿
She's good.

178
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,120
我不会干扰你们
Look, I won't interfere.

179
00:14:32,150 --> 00:14:34,370
要不然就叫警长逮捕我
And if I do, you've got a sheriff handy to arrest me,

180
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,250
也许你会觉得我让你没面子
but I understand if I threaten your Fish and Game authority--

181
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,290
对不起
Excuse me.

182
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,330
你们要去抓湖中怪物吗
Is it true you're going to look for some kind of monster in Black Lake?

183
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,460
那是个意外
Well, we're just gonna investigate an accident.

184
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,590
没有怪物
There's no monster.

185
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,760
个人被咬成两半
We heard a man was bit in half.

186
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:49,130
那只是意外
Well, there was an accident.

187
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,970
仅此而已 不用担心
That's all. It's nothing to worry about.

188
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,180
拜托
Oh, please.

189
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,230
走吧
All right. Let's go.

190
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:28,260
我先生两年前就过世了
Well, my husband passed away. It's been almost 2 years now.

191
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,720
警局并没有记录
My department doesn't have any record of that,

192
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,430
毕太太
Mrs. Bickerman.

193
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:36,390
很抱歉 我只是不喜欢记录
Well, I'm sorry. Incomplete records haunt me so.

194
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,800
你先生的死因是什么?
What was the cause of your husband's death,ma'am, do you know?

195
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:45,440
我们不想多管闲事 不过他是不是因为生病
We don't mean to invade your privacy, but was he ill? Was he sick?

196
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:46,940
还是被吞掉?
Was he swallowed?

197
00:15:46,970 --> 00:15:48,020
警长
Sheriff!

198
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,820
我们来此的原因是
Uh, Mrs. Bickerman, the reason we're here.

199
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:54,360
昨天有人被湖底的动物吃掉
A man was fatally attacked yesterday by some animal in this lake.

200
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,490
你知道你先生是怎么死的吗
Do you know how your husband died?

201
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,990
知道
Oh, yes.

202
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:59,160
我把他杀死了
I killed him.

203
00:16:01,110 --> 00:16:02,120
你杀了他?
You killed him?

204
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,450
是的
Oh, yes.

205
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,090
你是怎么杀死他的?
and how would you have accomplished this, ma'am?

206
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,380
呃
Well...

207
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:14,550
他病得很重却不肯看医生
He was very sick,and--and he refused to go to a doctor.

208
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:17,930
有时候清醒有时候糊涂
He'd be coherent one day and incoherent the next.

209
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:22,020
他清醒时叫我结束他的痛苦
And, well, one coherent day he asked me to end his suffering.

210
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:26,770
他一直不断地求我
And, um...he kept insisting and insisting

211
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,940
最后我只好答应
and then, well, finally I just gave in,

212
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:34,440
我用煎锅K他 再把他埋起来
and I hit him on the head with a skillet,then buried him out at the bulkhead.

213
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,530
不信的话可以挖出来看
Well, dig him up if you don't believe me,

214
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:41,030
福尔摩斯
Sherlock.

215
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,670
半哩外有块空地
Half mile up there's a clearing.

216
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:52,920
湖水怎么了? 好黑哦
What's with the water? It's so black.

217
00:16:52,950 --> 00:16:54,590
一点波浪都没有
There's no waves or anything.

218
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:56,640
本来要取名为宁静湖
Well, they wanted to call it "Lake Placid,"

219
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:59,180
有人说这名字被取过了
but somebody said that name was taken.

220
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:01,590
真可惜
It's too bad.

221
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,690
到了那儿帐蓬就应该搭好了
Tents were sent ahead. They should already be set up by the time we get there.

222
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,400
帐蓬?
Tents?

223
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:11,190
我们要睡帐蓬?
We're staying in tents?

224
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:13,900
我说这两天是要露营
I told you, 2 days we'd have to camp.

225
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:16,910
我以为你是说度假木屋
Yes, camp, but I thought that meant "Ramada lnn."

226
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,030
你可没提到帐蓬 有马桶吗?
I never heard tents. Will there be toilets?

227
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,080
也许该把你送回去
Maybe we should just take you back.

228
00:17:21,110 --> 00:17:23,410
就因为我习惯坐马桶?
Why, because I prefer a toilet?

229
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:24,200
精糕
Oh, God.

230
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:26,250
我忘了带卫生纸
We forgot to pack feminine napkins.

231
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,920
现在你跟他同一国 是吗
Oh, so you're with him now? Are you taking his side?

232
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:30,420
我没这么说
I didn't say a word.

233
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,420
我干脆把毒藤当卫生纸擦
Oh, no, maybe I should just wipe myself with some leafy little piece of poison oak.

234
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:38,470
然后像个猴子猛抓屁股这样
And then I could spend the whole day scratching my ass, blending in with the natives.

235
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,930
你就肯跟我同国
Then you'd be back on my side.

236
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,430
你不说我们也知道你是纽约客
You know, you really don't have to bother telling people you're from New York.

237
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,930
那是什么
What the hell is that?

238
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,020
什么?
What?

239
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:49,180
我看到什么
There. I thought I saw something.

240
00:17:50,930 --> 00:17:52,810
好像是根树枝
Looks like a branch.

241
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,230
我的天
Oh, my God.

242
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,120
嘿
Hey.

243
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,410
你是故意丢我的
You threw it at me!

244
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,910
我只是不小心放手了而已
I just let go of it.

245
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,370
你是故意丢我的
You threw it at me!

246
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,120
你看到吗
Did you see that? Oh!

247
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:06,960
女士
Ma'am!

248
00:18:06,990 --> 00:18:07,870
别再打我
Stop hitting me.

249
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,370
别向我乱丢东西
Don't throw heads at me!

250
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,040
别叫我女士
Stop calling me "ma'am!"

251
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,170
老天爷
Aw, Jesus.

252
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,010
天啊
Oh, God.

253
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:17,050
警长
So, sheriff...

254
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:20,090
你手下有几名警员?
how many deputies you got?

255
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,300
怎样?
What?

256
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:34,110
那会是熊吗?
Could it be a bear?

257
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,650
这儿的熊很大
I mean, the bears get big here, right?

258
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,450
大熊不可能一口咬掉麋鹿的头
Hmm. I don't think a bear could bite off a moose's head.

259
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,820
你的东西都在这儿
Everything you need should be in there.

260
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:43,280
很好
Ok. Good. Good.

261
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:44,950
你要一起睡吗?
So will we be tent-mates then?

262
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,410
不 这是你的
Nope. This is all yours.

263
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,250
真是太好了
Ohh. Great.

264
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,410
太好了
Excellent.

265
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,920
要什么尽管说
If there's anything else you need...

266
00:18:50,950 --> 00:18:52,920
我想问你一件事
Uh, one thing I wanted to ask you.

267
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:56,590
一个女孩子在野外安全吗
Uh, what's it like to be a woman in the woods of Maine?

268
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:01,050
这些臭男人不会野性大发吧
I mean, the guys don't turn all horny or anything like they did in Deliverance, right?

269
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,930
我就知道你在那里
I knew you were there.

270
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:12,400
你从未来过这儿 对吧
Never been to Maine before, huh?

271
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:15,060
我很讲究卫生 不太受欢迎
I have good hygiene. I'm not welcome.

272
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,110
你为什么要来
Why are you here, really?

273
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:19,360
我说过了
I told you.

274
00:19:19,390 --> 00:19:21,400
博物馆不会派人到荒郊野外
A museum doesn't send an investigator into the woods--

275
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:24,240
你凭什么这么说
How would you know what a museum would or would not do exactly?

276
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:28,540
他们更不会派讨厌帐篷的人来
Well, even if they did,I doubt whether he or she would have problems with tents.

277
00:19:28,570 --> 00:19:29,830
我是住不惯帐篷
So I don't like tents. Why--

278
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,620
你住不惯帐篷 受不了蚊子
Oh, you don't like tents, and you don't like mosquitoes.

279
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,870
谁受得了蚊子呀
Well, nobody likes mosquit--

280
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:33,880
看你的指甲
Look at your fingernails.

281
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:35,420
我的指甲怎么了?
What's wrong with my fingernails?

282
00:19:35,450 --> 00:19:38,460
打死你也不会跑到野外
You have as much business being in the woods as Emily Post.

283
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,630
没道理
No, it doesn't make sense.

284
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:42,380
大老远要你来看牙齿
They sent you out here to examine a tooth.

285
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,550
现在跑到湖这儿来干嘛?
And what are you doing out here on the lake?

286
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,430
糟了
Oh, no.

287
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:49,760
怎么了?
What?

288
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,640
不会是他吧
If this is who I think it is...

289
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,940
是他
It is.

290
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,440
谁?
Who?

291
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,530
赫克托·西尔
Hector Cyr.

292
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,860
有钱的神话学教授
He's this rich, kook mythology professor.

293
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,740
你认识他吗?
You know him?

294
00:20:09,770 --> 00:20:11,910
他跟博物馆合作过
He's done some work with our museum.

295
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:14,250
他也在世界各地
He also treks the world to s...

296
00:20:15,070 --> 00:20:16,250
干嘛?
What?

297
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,500
跟鳄鱼游泳
To swim with crocodiles.

298
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,760
鳄鱼
Crocodiles?

299
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,840
他一定认为这儿有鳄鱼
If he's here, he must think you've got one.

300
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:35,560
我不是科学天才 但我知道缅因州不可能有鳄鱼
I admit I'm no brain scientist,but I do know there's no way a crocodile could be in Maine, right?

301
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:40,230
你比我先到
You beat me!

302
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,490
讨厌
Balls!

303
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,990
好棒的一座湖
Splendid lake, eh?

304
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,990
我在湖上才能大展雄风
Became a man on a lake like this.

305
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,490
橡皮筏
Rubber raft.

306
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,490
西尔维亚布雷克
Sylvia Blake.

307
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,790
这个湖正好适合我
She gave like a cow.

308
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,950
渔猎局的人呢
Who do we have from Fish and Game?

309
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:53,960
是我
Me.

310
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:55,040
他是什么人?
Who is this man?

311
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:58,500
好一座死气沉沉的大湖 看起来几乎停滞
I can see the algae blooms just coming in. Looks almost stagnant.

312
00:20:58,530 --> 00:20:59,630
赫克托·西尔
Hector Cyr.

313
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:01,170
地球是圆的 你也圆嘟嘟的
Oh, the earth is round and so should you be.

314
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,130
他是谁
Who is he?

315
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,260
你有这里的地形图吗?
I need topographic studies. You got any?

316
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,550
等一下 你不能随便发号施令
Wait a second. You don't just fly in here and start barking orders.

317
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,760
抱歉 我得赶快先进行勘查
I apologize. I just don't want to lose the light when we got time for a quick scout.

318
00:21:10,790 --> 00:21:11,890
你开了吗?
Have you had a little work done?

319
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:12,930
没有
I have not.

320
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,980
你是谁
Who are you?

321
00:21:14,010 --> 00:21:15,020
赫克托·西尔 我说过
Hector Cyr. I said it once.

322
00:21:15,050 --> 00:21:16,480
让我知道什么时候勘查 好吗?
Let me know when it sinks in, ok?

323
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:17,560
你看到了吗?
Have you seen it?

324
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:18,350
没有
No.

325
00:21:18,380 --> 00:21:20,900
对不起 你是来...
Excuse me. You came here to...

326
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:22,610
帮你找到它
help you find it.

327
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:24,070
鳄鱼吗
A crocodile?

328
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:24,940
对
Yeah.

329
00:21:24,970 --> 00:21:26,490
湖水连接海洋
They've been migrating north, you know?

330
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:28,110
鳄鱼向北迁移
This lake does connect to the ocean.

331
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:29,820
这是有可能的
It's not as far fetched as it may sound.

332
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,330
鳄鱼是淡水动物
Crocodiles can't swim in saltwater.

333
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,870
你的知识太浅薄了
Yeah, well, that'll be your little secret.

334
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:36,700
快点 别浪费时间
Come on. We're losing time.

335
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,000
那个猪头干嘛找我碴?
Why did the big one heckle me?

336
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:40,670
老兄
Hey, pal...

337
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,200
我一定找得到它
If he's close, we'll find him.

338
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:13,950
这些迹象不会错
Their signatures are unmistakable.

339
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:16,700
她有没有说我跟她上过床
She tell you that we had sex together?

340
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,920
爽呆了
So vigorous!

341
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:21,040
我没跟你上过床
I never had sex with you.

342
00:22:21,070 --> 00:22:24,130
我很差劲 女人都没印象
Whew. I'm horrible in bed. They never remember.

343
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:25,050
天啊
God.

344
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,420
等等
Wait.

345
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:27,550
停住
Stop!

346
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,890
我好像听到什么
Thought I heard something.

347
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,230
请你原谅我的无知
I don't mean to be discourteous,

348
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:43,350
鳄鱼怎么会跑到新英格兰
but, uh, how is it a person could come to believe a crocodile is in New England?

349
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:46,360
它怎么度得了寒冬?
How could it survive winter?

350
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,280
只要鼻孔不结冰就行
Long as their nostrils don't freeze, they survive.

351
00:22:49,310 --> 00:22:52,280
干嘛呀 他连我名字都记不得
Am I foolish to explain things? He had such trouble with my name.

352
00:22:52,310 --> 00:22:53,240
- 赫克托 - 嘿
- Hector. - Hey.

353
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,620
就是这儿吗?
Is this where it happened?

354
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:55,700
就在这附近
Around here. Yeah.

355
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,870
离大海只有一哩 它游得过来
We're a mile from the ocean. He could've easily made it here.

356
00:22:57,900 --> 00:23:00,410
它得先游到海岸
Assuming he got this far up the seaboard.

357
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,210
巨鳄游得很快
The big ones have been on the move.

358
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,000
我早就说了 谁叫你不听
What have I been telling you? You call me crazy.

359
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:06,840
赫克托 划浆吧
Hector, just paddle.

360
00:23:06,870 --> 00:23:11,300
亲朋好友怎么劝你都不会听
You know, Sheriff, when friends or family say things, they tend not to register,

361
00:23:11,330 --> 00:23:14,930
那就听陌生人的准没错
so sometimes it helps to hear it from a total stranger.

362
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,680
你太肥了
You're fat.

363
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:18,600
赫克托 住嘴
Jesus. Hector!

364
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:19,890
是真的
Oh, yeah.

365
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,600
那是什么
What's that?

366
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:24,060
那是什么
What is it?

367
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:26,730
白鲈鱼群
White perch.

368
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,230
它们在吃东西吗
Are they feeding?

369
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:29,740
它们不是在吃东西
They aren't feeding.

370
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:31,190
它们受到惊吓
They're scared.

371
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,200
天啊
Jesus!

372
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,880
快把腿跨上来
Get your legs out of the water.

373
00:23:44,910 --> 00:23:45,880
别乱动
Don't move your legs.

374
00:23:45,910 --> 00:23:47,380
开玩笑的吧?
Are you kidding me?

375
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:49,420
腿要伸直
Keep your legs still.

376
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:54,180
走开
Get off!

377
00:23:54,210 --> 00:23:55,430
去左边
Hector, to the left.

378
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,930
到后面去
Move it left!

379
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:58,140
快划 快划
Paddle, paddle!

380
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:00,850
我们什么也没看到
No one actually saw anything.

381
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,850
是的 我了解
Yes, I realize that, sir,

382
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:06,860
船被翻过来应该不会是海獭干的
but something flipped us over, and I doubt very much if it was a mink.

383
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:09,860
我是博物馆派来的古生物学家
I am a paleontologist. I work for a natural history museum.

384
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,360
怎么样
I am not some--

385
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:12,860
他们不相信她
They don't believe her.

386
00:24:12,890 --> 00:24:14,030
谢了
Thank you.

387
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:18,240
你们在浪费纳税人的钱王八蛋
It's so rewarding to imagine my tax dollar finding its way to you, you fuck-shit!

388
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,870
你真辣
You're a saucy flirt.

389
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:22,370
你说得对
You were right.

390
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:25,380
野生动物保护局不肯派人来
U.S.Wildlife won't send anybody without a confirmation.

391
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:27,000
用不着他们
We don't need 'em.

392
00:24:27,910 --> 00:24:28,670
怎样?
Yeah?

393
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,710
你最好过来看看
Might wanna come take a look at this.

394
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:35,390
我的天
Oh, my God.

395
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,390
蛆
Worms.

396
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,800
我最讨厌蛆了
Oh, I gotta thing about worms.

397
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:39,970
那是人的脚趾
It's a human toe.

398
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,900
有点腐烂 有黏液
Some decomposition, a little acidic--

399
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:48,100
肯定是被吞食过
definitely been swallowed.

400
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,440
这就是死者吗?
Is this the man who was killed?

401
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,450
他比较高大
He seemed taller.

402
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,950
唷
Phew.

403
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:02,330
是鳄鱼没错 它们是关键动物
You got a croc, all right. They're a keystone species.

404
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:04,500
他又掉书袋子吗?
Did he just explain something?

405
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:07,000
关键动物影响整个生态系统
Keystone species effects the whole ecosystem.

406
00:25:07,030 --> 00:25:11,040
所以才引来蛆和鲈鱼
That would explain these worms and those perch.

407
00:25:11,870 --> 00:25:13,670
这是只鳄鱼
We got a crocodile.

408
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:17,090
这是你的朋友
Here's your friend.

409
00:25:33,890 --> 00:25:35,740
# It's not unusual #

410
00:25:35,770 --> 00:25:38,690
# To be loved by anyone #

411
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:41,410
# It's not unusual #

412
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,660
# To have fun with anyone #

413
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:47,370
# But when I see you hangin' around #

414
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,040
# With anyone #

415
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,040
# It's not unusual... #

416
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:52,090
他付我们钱
He paid us.

417
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:53,880
五百块钱
500.

418
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,550
这是个陷阱
It's a trap.

419
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:58,090
你们收他的钱
You accepted money from him?

420
00:25:58,870 --> 00:26:00,760
我们收的是支票
We took a check.

421
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:05,850
# When I see you out and about #

422
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,350
当警察很危险 对吧
Law enforcement is very dangerous work, isn't it?

423
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:11,810
你的咪咪好大哦
And you have such big, wonderful boobs.

424
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,860
谢谢夸奖
Ha ha. Thank you.

425
00:26:13,890 --> 00:26:15,690
# It's not unusual #

426
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,280
# It happens every day #

427
00:26:17,310 --> 00:26:18,400
嘿
Hey!

428
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:20,570
- 嘿 - 嘿
- Hey! - Hey!

429
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,370
你们是来执勤
We're here on official business.

430
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:24,120
不是来玩的
This is not a party.

431
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,240
你来了就不好玩
Yeah, but now that you're here...

432
00:26:28,030 --> 00:26:29,450
闭嘴
Quiet!

433
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:33,540
你挖洞干嘛?
What's with digging the holes?

434
00:26:33,570 --> 00:26:37,880
鳄鱼很大胆
Well, crocodiles are--are very brazen.

435
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:42,100
喜欢到陆地 也受声言吸引
They like to come on land, and of course they're attracted to noise.

436
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:44,220
大家都回自己的帐蓬去
Everybody out! Back to your tents!

437
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:45,310
快
Now!

438
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,810
她能不能留下来
Oh, could she stay?

439
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:49,690
我们...我们打算做爱
We were...we were hoping to mate.

440
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:50,900
不行
No.

441
00:26:50,930 --> 00:26:52,940
出去
Out.

442
00:26:54,890 --> 00:26:56,270
你给我听好
Now, you listen...

443
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:59,400
你在惹我 我会把你踢回姥姥家
If it were up to me, you'd be on your way home.

444
00:26:59,430 --> 00:27:00,700
但是 我说了算
But I'm not in charge.

445
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:02,740
那里有个伟大发现
That's a shocker there.

446
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:03,990
给我仔细听着
I'm going to say this

447
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,830
我很老实 有话都直说
because I believe in being straight with people.

448
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,660
我觉得你是个神经病
I think you are a mental.

449
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,290
警长
Sheriff...

450
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:15,460
谢谢你这么诚实
I appreciate your candor. Really, I do.

451
00:27:15,490 --> 00:27:18,840
知道别人的想法总是好的
I think it's always good to know where somebody's coming from,

452
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:23,010
不过你好像没什么想法
and, frankly, your origins have been a bit of a mystery to me.

453
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:45,580
湖面好平
Look how flat that water is.

454
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:48,540
一颗石子可以跳十下
You could get 10 skips on a good one, easy.

455
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:49,750
什么?
Sorry?

456
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,080
打水瓢子呀
Skipping stones.

457
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,330
暑假我都到爷爷的湖畔小屋
Growing up, I used to summer at my grandparents' place on a lake like this.

458
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,800
整天都在打水瓢子
I'd skip stones all day.

459
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:03,340
每次都赢别的小孩
Beat playing with the other kids.

460
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,840
我相信也是
I'm sure it did.

461
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:11,600
明天你最好留在岸上
Look, I think it's best if you stayed on shore a while.

462
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,730
你说什么
I beg your pardon?

463
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,690
我不想跟你吵
I'm not trying to pick a fight,

464
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,690
不过那玩意弄翻了船
but whatever's out there did flip a canoe.

465
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,690
我才不要留在岸上
I am not staying on shore.

466
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,940
太危险了
It's dangerous.

467
00:28:20,970 --> 00:28:22,950
我不是大老远跑来露营的
No, I didn't fly up here just to roast marshmallows.

468
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,860
你为什么要来
Why did you fly up here?

469
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:29,450
- 听着 - 古生物学家不会跑来抓鳄鱼
- Look. - paleontologists are not sent to Maine to hunt for crocodiles.

470
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,790
我是来看那伙牙齿
I was sent up here to look at the tooth.

471
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,160
你看过了牙齿
You looked at the tooth.

472
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:35,500
你到底来干什么
What are you doing out here?

473
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:41,380
我跟上司谈恋爱
I was dating my boss...

474
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:47,050
后来他泡上我的好友甩掉我
and he turned out to be involved with a coworker who was also my friend.

475
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:51,270
所以他故意派我到缅因州
And for the sake of comfort--theirs--I was shipped off to Maine.

476
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:54,220
我还不想回去
And I don't feel like going back yet.

477
00:28:57,050 --> 00:28:58,940
这是真的
I'm not making it up.

478
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:03,320
你大可以留在镇上不必跑来这里
Still, you don't have to stay out here. I mean, you can stay in town.

479
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:06,530
我来都来了 我才不走除非这儿有虱子
I've come. I'm here. I'm staying...unless there are ticks.

480
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:08,410
我了解鳄鱼
I know crocodiles.

481
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:09,910
放心 我不会碍着你
And I won't get in your way.

482
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,740
我只想参一脚
I just really do want to be a part of this.

483
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,710
七点整出发
7:00 A.M.?

484
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,080
谢谢
Thank you.

485
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,520
晚安
Good night.

486
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,850
谢谢你
Thank you.

487
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:16,830
我的妈呀
Jesus fucking Christ!

488
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,330
你在搞什么鬼
Ohh. What the hell are you doing?

489
00:31:18,360 --> 00:31:19,330
你在干什么?
What the hell are you doing?!

490
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,330
谁叫你躲在这儿
Oh, Jesus. You clowning around?

491
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,370
我正在装陷阱
I'm laying a spring trap!

492
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,750
陷阱?
A spring trap?

493
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,040
我不是说鳄鱼会跑到陆地上来
I keep telling you they can come on land you know.

494
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:24,790
你不想在半夜惊醒吧
You don't want to wake up in the middle of the night.

495
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,170
我差点向你开枪
I could've shot you.

496
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:29,840
这可能会救你一命
This could end up saving your life, which is meaningful for you,

497
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:33,930
不过你这么蠢也许我不应该救你
because the more you live, the more sex you get to have with your sister!

498
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,010
怎么回事
What's going on?

499
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,390
他带着手枪小便 他像蟑娜一样爬来爬去
He's crawling around like a cockroach here.

500
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,850
我不管他多么有钱
I don't care how much money--

501
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:39,180
他拿枪指住我
He's waving his little wang around!

502
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:40,560
把我吓个半死
He's scaring the shit out of me!

503
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:42,940
够了
All right, all right!

504
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,440
我只说一遍
I'll say this once.

505
00:31:44,470 --> 00:31:47,440
谢谢你带来的精密装备
Your fancy equipment aside, which we appreciate--

506
00:31:47,470 --> 00:31:49,730
不过你捣蛋就得走人
if you interfere, you're gone.

507
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,070
就这么简单
Simple as that.

508
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:00,790
这家伙真的秀逗了
How much of a wacko is this guy?

509
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:06,790
赫克托把鳄鱼看得很重要
Well...the thing about Hector is he takes this crocodile business very...

510
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,300
噢 老兄
Oh, man.

511
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,000
他认为鳄鱼是神
He thinks they're godly.

512
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:12,130
是什么
What was that?

513
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:15,800
每个原始文化都把鳄鱼神化
In his defense, every primitive culture known to man deified them.

514
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:18,350
中国 埃及 澳洲 亚洲
Ancient China, Egypt, Australia, Asia.

515
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:22,850
鳄鱼被崇拜的次数比耶稣还多
Going back in history, crocodiles have been more worshipped than Jesus.

516
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,860
所以我得把他当真吗?
Is this supposed to make us take him more seriously?

517
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,860
不 你得了解他的想法
No, it's supposed to make you understand him.

518
00:32:27,890 --> 00:32:31,690
他是神话学教授他相信鳄鱼很神圣
He's a mythology professor. He believes that they're divine conduits.

519
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,990
他找得到它 我们就忍着点
And he can find them, so we should try to put up with him.

520
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,700
他是个疯子
He's a fruitcake.

521
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,280
大家都去睡吧
We should get some sleep.

522
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:42,830
该死
Damn it!

523
00:32:42,860 --> 00:32:45,000
他也是个好猎人
And he's a good trapper.

524
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:10,940
鳄鱼听到就会有反应
We can expect a quick response if he hears that.

525
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:14,320
成鳄听到幼鳄声就会攻击
Adult crocs will move on distressed hatchlings.

526
00:33:14,350 --> 00:33:20,830
我不想问些幼稚问题不过要是这真是只鳄鱼
Again, I don't mean to be annoying with my questions but if it is a crocodile, which I don't think it is,

527
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:23,330
如果它听到幼鳄声会攻击你
and they do charge these baby hatchling sounds,

528
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:26,830
为什么还要到水底?
why exactly would you want to be underwater at the time?

529
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:28,330
这个人去就很合理了
With you, it makes sense.

530
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,000
鳄鱼是不会在水底攻击
You see, Sheriff, the thing is, they don't really attack underwater.

531
00:33:31,030 --> 00:33:33,050
那家伙在水底被吃掉
That Walt guy got hit underwater.

532
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,840
鳄鱼在水底也看不见
True. They don't see that well underwater.

533
00:33:34,870 --> 00:33:36,880
它们的眼睛上面有一层瞬膜
They have nictitating lenses over their eyes...

534
00:33:36,910 --> 00:33:38,260
停下
Burke, stop here.

535
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,100
- 现在? - 嗯
- Now? - Yeah.

536
00:33:40,130 --> 00:33:40,760
只要被鳄鱼盯上就潜到水底
...You dive underwater

537
00:33:40,790 --> 00:33:42,850
- 它们看不到你 - 它们闻得到
- and they probably won't be able to see you. - They can smell.

538
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:44,980
好了 我们得干活了
I hate to interrupt but we got work to do.

539
00:33:45,010 --> 00:33:46,690
讲话总可以吧
Hey, we can talk if we want.

540
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,190
可以讲话
Yeah, we can talk if we want.

541
00:33:48,220 --> 00:33:50,190
请你把锚放下去
Would you mind putting down the anchor?

542
00:33:54,060 --> 00:33:57,820
我们一下去就打开来
Wait till we're down there before you turn that thing on.

543
00:33:57,850 --> 00:33:59,700
好的
Got it.

544
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,450
走吧 赫克托
Let's go, Hector.

545
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,740
祝好运
Good luck.

546
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:16,800
我带了猪肉当护身符
I brought a pork chop for luck.

547
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:19,090
你最好挂在脖子上
Maybe you can hang it around your neck.

548
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:20,300
你真好心
That's sweet.

549
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:24,260
待会我再让你替我服务
Maybe later you can chew the bark off my big, fat log.

550
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,060
那是搞基暗示吗
Was that, like, a homosexual remark?

551
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:38,070
别问我
Don't ask me.

552
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:29,290
他一定是个疯子
Could be a mental.

553
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:33,130
不过有钱的疯子被称为怪人
I heard if a mental person is rich enough, they just call him eccentric.

554
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,670
他不是疯子
He's not mental.

555
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,300
他是鳄鱼专家
He's seen every crocodile in the world.

556
00:35:36,330 --> 00:35:39,630
他跟食人鳄游泳都没被咬过
He even swam in the Grametti with killer Niles. He never got nipped.

557
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:42,640
所以他才把鳄鱼当成神
And that's why he thinks they're godly--

558
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:44,010
只是因为没被咬过?
'Cause they don't bite him?

559
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,350
我不知道
I don't know.

560
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,680
他说他相信鳄鱼的眼睛
He said he knew it when he looked in their eyes.

561
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:49,850
那是鱼龙之眼
"Eyes of a Dragon."

562
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,910
有鳄鱼才怪呢
So much for crocodiles.

563
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:05,050
它大概在陆地上
It's probably on land.

564
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,380
是啊
Yeah, right.

565
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,220
那是什么
What was that?

566
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,890
不晓得
I don't know.

567
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:17,310
可恶
Shit.

568
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,980
锚被什么勾住了
Hey! Something's got the anchor line!

569
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:21,730
快割断它
Untie it! Untie the line!

570
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:22,860
我在试
I'm trying!

571
00:37:22,890 --> 00:37:24,400
快
Hurry!

572
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:26,110
快割断它
Cut the line!

573
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:26,740
好
Right!

574
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:28,820
糟糕
Shit!

575
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:32,290
快点
Come on.

576
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:33,290
怎么回事
What happened?

577
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,700
不知道
I don't know.

578
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:38,120
快点呀
Hurry. Hurry up.

579
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:43,170
它一定把锚放掉了
Must've just let go.

580
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,090
快发动啊
Come on.

581
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:49,510
糟糕 警长
Shit! Hurry!

582
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,390
汉克
Hank!

583
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,390
好了
Ok!

584
00:38:04,930 --> 00:38:06,360
噢
Oh!

585
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,570
快点!
Hurry!

586
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:18,290
快点!
Hurry.

587
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,250
小心 它就在下面
My God, it's right under you!

588
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,720
老天
Aah! Oh, Christ.

589
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:28,220
快上船
Come on, get in the boat.

590
00:38:28,250 --> 00:38:29,590
你没事吧?
You all right?

591
00:38:29,620 --> 00:38:31,220
嗯
Yeah.

592
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:32,720
赫克托呢
Where's Hector?

593
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:34,770
不知道
I lost track.

594
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,640
我们分散开来
We went different directions.

595
00:38:43,850 --> 00:38:46,150
那边有水泡
There's some bubbles over there.

596
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,870
拖上来
Pull it up.

597
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:01,710
把他拖上来
All right. Come on. Bring him aboard.

598
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,840
怎么回事
What's happened?

599
00:39:02,870 --> 00:39:03,540
快点
Come on.

600
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:05,880
- 你们看到了? - 我看见了一个东西
- You see it? - We saw something.

601
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,710
- 多大? - 闭嘴 赶紧上来
- How big is it? - Shut up and get on board.

602
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:09,720
把声纳拉上来
We lost track of it. Burke, pull up the speaker!

603
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,170
你没事吧
Are you all right?

604
00:39:24,890 --> 00:39:26,530
- 启动引擎 - 啊
- Grab him! - Aah!

605
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,070
拉他上来
Pull him in!

606
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,610
拉他上来
Pull him in!

607
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,450
好了吗
That it?

608
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,610
好了
Yeah.

609
00:39:36,730 --> 00:39:38,750
发生得太快 没有人看到
Nobody actually saw it. It happened suddenly.

610
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,910
不是被船桨绞死的吗
Didn't get caught in the outboard?

611
00:39:41,740 --> 00:39:43,750
不是
It wasn't the outboard.

612
00:39:51,750 --> 00:39:54,930
叫他们尽快赶来
Tell them to get here fast, huh?

613
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:59,640
你没事吧
You OK?

614
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:02,930
凯莉
Kelly?

615
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:05,600
没事
Yeah.

616
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:08,820
谁都没看见吗
Nobody saw anything.

617
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:10,980
没有
No.

618
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:14,160
野生动物保护局正派人来
U.S. Wildlife's on their way.

619
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:18,280
警方要封锁一切的消息
The police want to keep everything quiet so the press doesn't get wind of anything.

620
00:40:19,270 --> 00:40:21,790
大家都要我们...
Everybody just wants us to...

621
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:23,790
按兵不动
"Sit tight."

622
00:40:30,330 --> 00:40:32,590
你真的没事吗
Are you...ok?

623
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:35,470
呃...
Well...

624
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,220
你知道
you know...

625
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,970
真的
Yeah.

626
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,020
警长 我
Well, Sheriff, I'm, uh...

627
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:50,270
为你的手下感到遗憾
Very sorry about your deputy.

628
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,690
他是个好人吗
He was a good man?

629
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,030
是
Yep.

630
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,250
只要有人丧命
Whenever somebody dies, I...

631
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,450
我没能认识他就会感到难过
I always think that it's such a waste that I didn't know them any better.

632
00:41:06,570 --> 00:41:09,080
很遗憾你没认识
Sorry for your loss, Hector.

633
00:41:10,580 --> 00:41:12,500
我不是这个意思
Not really what I meant.

634
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:20,220
他的头被咬掉
Head was just...bitten off.

635
00:41:21,750 --> 00:41:25,770
我以前常梦到我没有头
You know, I used to have a recurring nightmare that I was headless.

636
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:29,310
我在地上看着无头的身体
I'd be down on the ground looking up at my body, no head,

637
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:31,820
到处跌跌撞撞
just walking around bumping into everything.

638
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:35,820
我父母不肯让我走屋
And my parents...wouldn't let me in the house.

639
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:37,820
他们怕我撞坏新买的古董台灯
Because they just bought all these antique lamps,

640
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:39,700
而且他们不希望我去打扰他们 王八蛋
and they didn't want me to knock them over, the fuckers.

641
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:45,790
邻居小孩觉得我的头像一颗球
Then the neighborhood bullies, they'd see my round head on the ground looking like a ball,

642
00:41:45,820 --> 00:41:48,790
于是就把它当足球踢
and they'd come over, and they'd start a soccer game.

643
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:50,290
我的头被踢来踢去
And as I was being kicked around,

644
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:54,130
我却很高兴能跟他们一起玩
I'd actually just feel grateful for being allowed in the game.

645
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:59,640
你觉得怎样?
What are-- what are your thoughts?

646
00:41:59,670 --> 00:42:01,760
你知道吗
You know, Hector...

647
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:06,770
我相信你应该是个好疯子
I'm sure you're a fine person in your own mental way,

648
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,980
我想你最好别跟我讲话
but I think it would be best if you and I didn't speak.

649
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:18,950
野生动物保护局几时才来
When is U.S. Wildlife getting here?

650
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:21,490
我还在等消息
I'm still waiting to confirm if they...

651
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,450
噢 天
Oh, Jesus.

652
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,790
我可以把他救下来
I--I could probably cut him down,

653
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:34,800
不过他的表情有点古怪
but there's this odd look of mayhem on his upside-down face.

654
00:42:34,830 --> 00:42:36,470
汉克
Hank.

655
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,670
什么?
Yes?

656
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:39,710
你没事吧
Are you all right?

657
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,760
可以救我下来吗
Could you cut me down?

658
00:42:41,790 --> 00:42:44,470
答应我你不能伤害我
Do you promise that you won't attempt to injure me?

659
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:47,850
我连看都不想看你一眼
I have no interest in ever looking at you, Hector.

660
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,060
好吧
Ok.

661
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,900
直接把他拉下来就行
Just, uh, pull him down. It's a counterweight.

662
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:57,320
我去拿刀子
Here. I'll get the knife.

663
00:42:57,350 --> 00:43:01,570
如果我记得有陷阱就不会让你去
If I'd remembered it was there, I never would've let you walk that way.

664
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,330
没事了
All right. It's over.

665
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,700
没事了 记得吗
It's over. Remember?

666
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:07,200
你答应不伤害他
You promised not to hurt him, so...

667
00:43:07,230 --> 00:43:09,210
我说谎
I lied.

668
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:10,670
等等 嘿
Wait. Hey! Hey!

669
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:12,170
住手 住手
Come on! Hold up!

670
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:13,710
你无处可逃了
Nowhere to go, my friend.

671
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,960
别闹了
Now, just--come on! Knock it off!.

672
00:43:15,990 --> 00:43:17,630
快放下来
Knock it off. Put that down.

673
00:43:17,660 --> 00:43:18,750
冷静点
Just settle...

674
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:22,800
小心
Jesus! Look out!

675
00:43:23,790 --> 00:43:26,180
哇
Whoa!

676
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:35,650
操
Aw, shit!

677
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:56,880
好吧
Ok.

678
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:59,210
我承认
I admit it.

679
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,380
那是只鳄鱼
It's a crocodile.

680
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:04,300
它是印度太平洋鳄
He's an lndo-Pacific.

681
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:07,390
鳞片是椭圆形 是亚洲鳄
Scales were oval. He's an Asian crocodile.

682
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:10,020
它为什么会跑来这儿?
Why would he come here? It's impossible.

683
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:12,020
亚洲 它是怎么来的?
Asia. How would he get here?

684
00:44:12,050 --> 00:44:15,480
香港有个猪头把它冲下马桶
Obviously some asshole in Hong Kong flushed him down the toilet.

685
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:17,400
它一定有三十尺长
He was 30 feet, right? Had to be.

686
00:44:17,430 --> 00:44:20,490
幸好我带了一把大枪
Well, now maybe somebody's happy I brought my big gun.

687
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:22,650
你要把它轰死吗
Oh you're gonna blow him away now?

688
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:23,530
当然了
I should think so.

689
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:24,410
用大炮把它轰死
With your cannon?

690
00:44:24,440 --> 00:44:25,870
是啊 不应该吗
Right. What, I shouldn't?

691
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:29,120
- 它是大自然的奇迹 - 但是它很可怖
- Well, he's a miracle of nature, - but I know he's very scary.

692
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:30,830
你才是大自然的奇迹
You're the miracle of nature.

693
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:31,870
够了 冷静点
Guys, guys, easy, easy.

694
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:34,080
今晚什么也不能做
We're not gonna do anything tonight.

695
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:37,840
我不知道鳄鱼能横越大海
I never heard of a crocodile crossing an ocean.

696
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:40,340
这是书本上的知识
Well, they conceal information like that in books.

697
00:44:40,370 --> 00:44:41,510
好了
All right, pal!

698
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:42,840
冷静点
Hey, hey. hey-

699
00:44:42,870 --> 00:44:45,010
放开他
No, no. Let him go.

700
00:44:45,040 --> 00:44:46,600
我也受不了他
I'm sick of him, too.

701
00:44:46,630 --> 00:44:47,600
我得警告你
I do need to warn you, Sheriff.

702
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:49,140
我家很有钱
The thing about being rich,

703
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:51,680
我从小就被送去学空手道
my parents did have the added luxury of ditching me off at karate school

704
00:44:51,710 --> 00:44:53,730
我是棕带高手
on a regular basis, so I am a brown belt.

705
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:56,020
尽管来吧
Go ahead. Take your best shot.

706
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:58,230
汉克
Hank!

707
00:44:58,260 --> 00:45:00,480
他说他会空手道
He said he knew karate.

708
00:45:00,510 --> 00:45:01,440
你打他
You hit him.

709
00:45:01,470 --> 00:45:02,780
没错
I did, yeah.

710
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:04,450
来
Here.

711
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:06,660
他有说开始吗
Did he say "go"?

712
00:45:06,690 --> 00:45:09,240
比试前不都要先说开始吗
Aren't you supposed to say "go" in karate?

713
00:45:09,270 --> 00:45:10,580
他应该说开始的
You're supposed to say "go."

714
00:45:10,610 --> 00:45:13,210
离他远一点
Hank, just keep your distance from him.

715
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,000
赫克托 回你的帐篷去
Hector, go to your tent. Cool down.

716
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:18,040
他没有回答我
He doesn't answer my questions?

717
00:45:18,070 --> 00:45:20,380
你怎么不回答?
Why don't you answer my questions?

718
00:45:20,410 --> 00:45:22,920
要是我撞到树一定会说开始
I fall into a hole. I go up in a tree.

719
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:24,170
我发誓 我会说开始
I swear to God, I'll say "go."

720
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:25,220
先鞠躬再说开始
You bow, and then you say "go."

721
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:27,050
你去死吧
As in "go fuck yourself."

722
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:29,510
他们好像小孩子
Jesus. They're just like children.

723
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:30,760
是啊
Yeah.

724
00:45:30,790 --> 00:45:32,270
老天
Oh, my God.

725
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:34,390
你没事吧
Are you all right?

726
00:45:34,420 --> 00:45:35,940
我没事
Yeah, I'm all right.

727
00:45:35,970 --> 00:45:37,100
我有急救箱
I've got something for that.

728
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:38,100
让我来弄
I can fix that.

729
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:39,110
真的吗
Yeah?

730
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:40,230
真的
Yeah.

731
00:45:41,850 --> 00:45:44,740
我得绑紧一点
I just gotta pull it a little tighter.

732
00:45:44,770 --> 00:45:46,070
好了
There we go.

733
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:48,110
这是谁教你的?
Who taught you to be a nurse?

734
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,910
我爸是外科医生
Father's a surgeon.

735
00:45:49,940 --> 00:45:54,120
我还会缝合 其实这样最好
I can even stitch in a pinch, which probably wouldn't be such a bad idea on this.

736
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:55,750
不用了
Uh, no, thanks.

737
00:45:55,780 --> 00:45:57,040
好吧
Ok.

738
00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:02,380
鳄鱼跳出来你的表情好逗
You should have seen the look on your face when that croc jumped out.

739
00:46:04,290 --> 00:46:06,210
你看到熊的表情吗?
You see the look on the bear?

740
00:46:07,250 --> 00:46:09,130
就是那个表情
That was the look.

741
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:12,010
我不知道
I don't know.

742
00:46:12,040 --> 00:46:15,930
大自然法则可能改变了那玩意真是...
The laws of nature could be changing, Jack.That thing out there, that's--

743
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,520
你玩得很开心 对吧?
You're having the best time of your life, aren't you?

744
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:21,150
什么?
What?

745
00:46:21,180 --> 00:46:22,940
有人被咬死耶
What? People have been killed.

746
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:25,280
我并不开心
I hardly think I'm having a good time.

747
00:46:25,310 --> 00:46:27,190
你怎么能
Why would you--

748
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:30,490
这么明显吗
Does it show?

749
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:41,710
这是我第一次真正冒险
This is the first time I've ever actually...you know, been in the middle of anything.

750
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:47,340
你就是想要来冒险吗?
Is that why you're here, to get in the middle of something?

751
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:51,090
也许吧
Maybe.

752
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:56,600
我老是读一些冒险故事而却没有...
I've always read about what's happened. I've never...

753
00:47:01,840 --> 00:47:03,940
我们应该上床了
We should go to bed.

754
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:08,280
我是说该去休息了
I mean we should go to, uh... rest.

755
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:11,280
各自回帐篷休息
We should go to our separate tents,

756
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:13,740
我有一些
and--here-- get some--go.

757
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,910
谢了
I got it.

758
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:23,870
谢谢你帮我包扎伤口
Thanks for the bandage.

759
00:47:25,490 --> 00:47:27,380
晚安
Night.

760
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:28,670
晚安
Yeah.

761
00:47:40,880 --> 00:47:43,310
迅雷不及掩耳
It doesn't even see him.

762
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:47,610
看 它成功了
There, he got it.

763
00:47:49,810 --> 00:47:52,070
它只有一个天敌
He has one natural enemy.

764
00:47:52,100 --> 00:47:53,740
只有一个
Only one.

765
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:55,660
人类
Man?

766
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:56,820
人类
Man.

767
00:47:58,480 --> 00:47:59,950
你是专家
So you're the big expert.

768
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:02,790
这玩意是变种吗
You think ours is some kind of mutant or---

769
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:05,630
不一定 印度也有三十尺巨鳄
Not necessarily. There's a 30-footer in India.

770
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:09,050
被猎杀最大的记录是27尺
Biggest one ever killed on record was 27 feet.

771
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:11,800
它为什么跑来这里?
So why is he here?

772
00:48:11,830 --> 00:48:14,010
老实说
Honestly...

773
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:19,430
我不知道
I don't know.

774
00:48:41,570 --> 00:48:43,460
要提高警觉
Keep your eyes peeled.

775
00:48:43,490 --> 00:48:46,380
鳄鱼的动作是很快
You know how fast these things can be.

776
00:48:46,410 --> 00:48:48,420
我身上有虱子
I've got ticks, I know it.

777
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:51,630
虱子特别喜欢我
They're just so drawn to me. I gotta thing about ticks.

778
00:48:51,660 --> 00:48:56,300
钻进我的头发和皮肤里
Crawling up your pant leg. Put their heads under your skin.

779
00:48:57,080 --> 00:48:58,680
你们看
Look.

780
00:48:58,710 --> 00:48:59,720
什么?
What?

781
00:48:59,750 --> 00:49:01,010
杰克
Jack.

782
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:11,360
好大的足印
That's a pretty big print.

783
00:49:19,150 --> 00:49:20,410
你飞得越来越低
Seems like we're getting lower.

784
00:49:20,440 --> 00:49:23,080
因为我要降落
That's what happens when I land.

785
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:24,410
为什么
Why are we landing?

786
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:28,290
这显然是它住的洞穴
Because this is the cove that he obviously lives in.

787
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:30,290
你干嘛降落?
So why are we landing?

788
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:32,340
赫克托
Hector!

789
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:43,100
可以拓下来吗
We can lift it?

790
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:44,480
也许可以
Maybe.

791
00:49:44,510 --> 00:49:46,100
别把它弄糊
Don't want to mush it there.

792
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:47,440
才没有
I'm not mushing it.

793
00:49:47,470 --> 00:49:50,770
别那么用力 太软了
You might mush it. It's a little soft.

794
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:53,650
拜托 我才没有用力
For Christ's sake, I'm not mushing it!

795
00:50:00,690 --> 00:50:03,120
老天爷
Oh, God.

796
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:04,750
好
Ok.

797
00:50:04,780 --> 00:50:06,960
我受够了
That is it! That is it!

798
00:50:06,990 --> 00:50:09,710
不 不 我碰到头了
No, no, I keep getting hit with heads!

799
00:50:09,740 --> 00:50:10,750
冷静点 好吗?
Try to calm down.

800
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:12,090
你才冷静点
You calm down!

801
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,880
冷静点 深呼吸
Calm down, ok? Just keep breathing.

802
00:50:14,910 --> 00:50:17,260
我很冷静 我很镇定
I'm being very calm! I am composed!

803
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:21,680
这是我第二次被断头打到
This is the second time I've been hit with a severed head,and it upsets me!

804
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:24,890
搞什么...
What the hell?

805
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:35,320
我只想回帐篷去
I just want to go back to my tent now.

806
00:50:35,350 --> 00:50:37,400
可以回去吗?
Can we please go back?

807
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:40,410
别开玩笑
You gotta be kidding.

808
00:50:40,440 --> 00:50:42,280
我没开玩笑
I'm not kidding!

809
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:44,330
你看
Look.

810
00:50:44,360 --> 00:50:45,700
# The itsy-bitsy spider #

811
00:50:45,730 --> 00:50:48,040
# Crawled up the water spout #

812
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:49,580
我的天
# Down comes the rain #

813
00:50:49,610 --> 00:50:52,460
# To wash the spider out? #

814
00:50:56,910 --> 00:50:58,800
她在干嘛
What is she doing?

815
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:00,210
# Dum de dum de dum #

816
00:51:01,750 --> 00:51:03,050
噢
Oh.

817
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,010
什么?
What?

818
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:07,010
注意看水边十尺处
Look 10 feet into the water.

819
00:51:16,560 --> 00:51:18,690
快来吃哟
Come and get it!

820
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:29,620
哇
Wow.

821
00:51:31,740 --> 00:51:33,420
令人作呕
Disgusting.

822
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:34,880
我又没有犯法
I haven't broken any laws.

823
00:51:34,910 --> 00:51:36,300
你有犯法
Oh, but you have, ma'am.

824
00:51:36,330 --> 00:51:37,210
你欺骗警察
You lied to us.

825
00:51:37,240 --> 00:51:38,920
那是妨碍公务
That can be obstruction of justice.

826
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:41,630
你害一个人被咬死
A man has been killed, in part because of your silence.

827
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:43,930
我可以告你蓄意危害他人
I could make out a charge of reckless endangerment.

828
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,430
你拿牛去喂鳄鱼也是不对的
And I'm sure PETA would be annoyed at how you treat your cows.

829
00:51:47,460 --> 00:51:51,230
我要是老实说你就会去猎杀它
The reason I lied, if I told you the truth, you'd hunt it down and kill it,

830
00:51:51,260 --> 00:51:53,230
这不就是你所要做的吗
which seems to be exactly what you're trying to do.

831
00:51:53,260 --> 00:51:55,060
你喂这只巨鳄有多久了
How long have you been feeding this thing?

832
00:51:55,090 --> 00:51:56,860
六年了
6 years.

833
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:58,900
六年?
6 years?

834
00:52:00,640 --> 00:52:03,740
柏尼去钓鱼 它就跟着回来
Well, Bernie was out fishing, and it followed him home.

835
00:52:03,770 --> 00:52:07,950
我们拿东西喂它 它又没害人
So we threw it some scraps, and, well, he didn't seem to bother anybody.

836
00:52:07,980 --> 00:52:11,040
它就像是野生的宠物
He became kind of like a pet who lives in the wild.

837
00:52:11,070 --> 00:52:12,120
他就这么出现了?
He just appeared?

838
00:52:12,150 --> 00:52:13,630
你不知道它是怎么来的
You have no idea how he arrived here?

839
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:16,170
不知道 你知道吗
No. Do you?

840
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:20,380
你不是把柏尼推去喂鳄鱼吧
Your husband Bernie, you didn't, by any chance, lead him to the lake blindfolded?

841
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:24,470
你再乱讲我就要你好看
If I had a dick, this is where I'd tell you to suck it.

842
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:26,800
你先生是被巨鳄吃掉吗
Did the crocodile kill your husband?

843
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:31,020
是 不过那是个错误
Yes, but it was all...it was a mistake.

844
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:32,440
错误?
A mistake?

845
00:52:32,470 --> 00:52:36,310
两年前一匹马挣脱缰绳
One of our horses got loose 2 years ago.

846
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:38,320
跑去湖边喝水
Went to the lake to drink,

847
00:52:38,350 --> 00:52:41,820
巨鳄想吃它 柏尼去拦它
and the crocodile started coming in, and Bernie went to intercede, and--

848
00:52:41,850 --> 00:52:46,530
要是我报警它一定没命
if I'd reported it, they'd have sent people to kill it.

849
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:48,790
你怎么能不报警?
Ma'am, how could you not report this?

850
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:50,620
这会害死人
It puts human life at risk.

851
00:52:50,650 --> 00:52:52,330
湖边没人烟
Nobody lives on this lake.

852
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,540
这是它的湖
It's really his lake now.

853
00:52:56,860 --> 00:53:00,300
我知道你疯了 不过别下去
Come on, Hector. I know you're crazy, but you can't do this.

854
00:53:00,330 --> 00:53:02,380
我得看看它的鳄窝
I need to see his habitat up close, Deputy Gare.

855
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:04,050
看"动物奇观"嘛
Then watch Nova, ok?

856
00:53:04,080 --> 00:53:06,640
别下水
But don't go in the water.

857
00:53:06,670 --> 00:53:07,930
求求你
Please.

858
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:09,640
我跟你上床
I'll have sex with you.

859
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:11,060
快走吧
Let's just get out of here.

860
00:53:11,090 --> 00:53:12,180
亲爱的
Darling,

861
00:53:12,210 --> 00:53:14,680
它不会伤害我的
he's not gonna hurt me.

862
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:17,810
别去
Don't.

863
00:53:26,190 --> 00:53:27,360
赫克托
Hector!

864
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:35,060
犯罪率这么高 飞机老是失事
Murders and rapes in the cities. People bomb planes.

865
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:36,940
警察也没办法
Can the police stop them? No.

866
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:38,820
我只是用小牛喂一只鳄鱼
But feed one little cow to a crocodile--

867
00:53:38,850 --> 00:53:42,780
你被软禁了 乖乖等警察来
You stay right here until the police show. You're under full house arrest.

868
00:53:42,810 --> 00:53:44,320
谢了...
Thank you...

869
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:45,950
蠢警长
Officer Fuckmeat.

870
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:48,540
警长 赫克托有麻烦
Sheriff, we gotta problem with Hector.

871
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:50,040
什么麻烦
What problem?

872
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:52,330
他潜下去了
He went swimming.

873
00:53:54,610 --> 00:53:55,750
收到
Check.

874
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:16,290
我突然觉得自己很蠢
Suddenly I feel a bit foolish here.

875
00:55:18,450 --> 00:55:19,830
你跟别的鳄鱼不同
You're different from the others.

876
00:55:22,290 --> 00:55:24,300
我的天
Holy Spirit of Sobek.

877
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:27,630
我的妈呀
Holy Ghost.

878
00:55:28,620 --> 00:55:29,970
他妈的
Holy shit.

879
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,180
赫克托
Hector!

880
00:55:32,210 --> 00:55:35,140
赶快启动引擎
Just turn the ignition.

881
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:36,970
很容易
It's fuel injected.

882
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:43,020
快点
Come on!

883
00:55:44,770 --> 00:55:50,650
我知道咬断我的头很爽
I know that under the circumstances, biting my head off might seem viable.

884
00:55:51,400 --> 00:55:53,070
不过你没这么贱吧
It would cheapen you.

885
00:55:56,110 --> 00:55:57,870
我用枪打它
I may get a shot!

886
00:55:57,900 --> 00:55:58,870
不行
No!

887
00:55:58,900 --> 00:56:01,210
子弹打不穿它
Bullets might not penetrate its hide.

888
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:04,010
天啊 加油 再游过来一点
Oh, Jesus. All right, just a little further.

889
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:05,250
就像这样
Just like that.

890
00:56:21,300 --> 00:56:22,690
快走
Move over!

891
00:56:25,970 --> 00:56:27,400
快走
Go!

892
00:56:29,310 --> 00:56:30,820
- 快飞 - 我正在试
- "Go! - I'm trying.

893
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:35,120
天啊
Ahh! Jesus!

894
00:57:00,630 --> 00:57:03,690
鳄鱼先生 你这次太过份
That's your last little stunt, Mr. Crocodile.

895
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:04,900
你被禁足了
You're grounded.

896
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:07,740
这些可是精密的装备
This is some very delicate equipment that you're throwing around.

897
00:57:07,770 --> 00:57:08,860
我不管 你想自杀 是吗
I don't care. You trying to kill yourself?.

898
00:57:08,890 --> 00:57:10,780
你想去见你老伴 对吗
You want to meet your maker, is that it?

899
00:57:10,810 --> 00:57:15,620
你想跟鱼神游泳是你家的事
You might think they're godly,you might get some spiritual lift out of backstroking with dragons,

900
00:57:15,650 --> 00:57:18,250
不过你差点害死一名警员
but you just put a deputy at risk out there, sir.

901
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,330
可是它没把我吃掉
Let's not overlook the fact that he didn't eat me.

902
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:22,880
因为它刚吃了一头牛
'Cause he just ate a cow, stupid.

903
00:57:22,910 --> 00:57:25,380
我是平民 不是赙鱼
I'm a civilian. I'm not a trout.

904
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:27,670
你根本管不着我
You have no authority over me whatsoever.

905
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:28,670
我可以逮捕你
Hey, hey, I can arrest you.

906
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:29,920
那就动手呀
Well, then do it.

907
00:57:33,370 --> 00:57:34,720
你伤了他的自尊心
You hurt his feelings.

908
00:57:34,750 --> 00:57:36,510
我不在乎 你在乎吗
I don't care. Do you care?

909
00:57:36,540 --> 00:57:38,600
不在乎 他是个混球
No. He's an asshole.

910
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:55,200
你想被它吃掉吗
Did you want to be killed by it?

911
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,700
你真以为我疯了吗?
You think I'm that nuts?

912
00:57:57,730 --> 00:57:58,740
赫克托
Hector.

913
00:57:58,770 --> 00:58:03,250
你这种行为等于是自杀
What you just did, there had to be at least some sort of a death wish going on.

914
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:06,540
在古美拉尼西亚
In ancient Melanesia,

915
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:10,000
嫌犯都被丢进鳄鱼池
people suspected of crimes would be thrown to the crocodiles.

916
00:58:10,580 --> 00:58:13,590
鳄鱼们会判定什么人有罪
Crocodiles would decide. They would be the judge.

917
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:17,510
你想受到审判吗
Oh, and so that was you wanting to be judged out there?

918
00:58:17,540 --> 00:58:19,850
也许吧 又怎样
Maybe I was, and so what?

919
00:58:20,210 --> 00:58:21,810
很没道理吗?
Is that too arbitrary?

920
00:58:23,010 --> 00:58:24,900
总比当个有钱人好吧
Better to be measured by my wealth?

921
00:58:24,930 --> 00:58:29,360
总比被别人讨着要钱好吧
Better for me to get my self-esteem looking in the eyes of cheap sycophants craving a meal ticket?

922
00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:30,940
鱼龙眼里有诚实
There was more honesty in those dragon's eyes.

923
00:58:30,970 --> 00:58:33,400
鱼龙眼里有尊严
There was more dignity in those dragon's eyes.

924
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:34,740
老天爷 废话少说
Jesus, Hector, cut the shit.

925
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:37,280
是啊 管它的
Aw, fuck it.

926
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:40,160
你答应不再下水了?
So, can I tell them you won't go back in the water?

927
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:42,710
是啊 我答应不再下水
Oh, yeah, sure. I'm not going back in the water.

928
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:44,830
我不可能再下水了
No way I'm going back in the water.

929
00:58:44,860 --> 00:58:46,750
好吧
OK.

930
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:49,330
凯莉
Kelly.

931
00:58:52,370 --> 00:58:54,670
别让他们杀死它
We can't let 'em kill it.

932
00:59:02,550 --> 00:59:07,230
好 收拾一下 准备走
Yeah, pull all the trucks in and start packing.

933
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:08,230
全部吗
Everything?

934
00:59:08,260 --> 00:59:09,230
对
Yeah.

935
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:10,480
好
All right.

936
00:59:10,510 --> 00:59:14,820
我会通知他们 佛州渔猎局三个钟头后到
Just heard from Wildlife and Florida Fish and Game. They're gonna be here in 3 hours.

937
00:59:14,850 --> 00:59:16,070
好吧
Ok.

938
00:59:16,100 --> 00:59:18,660
我们最好收拾走人
So we might as well pack up.

939
00:59:18,690 --> 00:59:20,910
好主意
Good idea.

940
00:59:20,940 --> 00:59:23,290
他们会猎捕它吗
Will they try to trap him?

941
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:24,540
什么?
Sorry?

942
00:59:24,570 --> 00:59:28,460
佛州渔猎局会怎么对付它
Florida Fish and Game. What'll they do when they get here?

943
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:30,170
告诉她呀
Tell her, Jack.

944
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:36,090
用渔网抓不到它
Won't be able to snag him in pitments, right?

945
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:38,680
它在水底被麻醉会淹死
And you tranq him in the water, and he drowns.

946
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:40,350
他们可以在陆地上麻醉它
They could try to tranq him on land.

947
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:42,520
他们不会这么做
Oh, sure, they could, but they won't.

948
00:59:42,550 --> 00:59:43,560
它伤了人命
He's taken human life.

949
00:59:43,590 --> 00:59:45,350
肯定活不了
The mission will be to put him down.

950
00:59:45,920 --> 00:59:47,310
是真的吗
Is that true?

951
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:50,150
捕不到三十尺以上的巨鳄
They've never been able to trap anything 30 feet.

952
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:52,360
他们得试试看
But they have to try, right?

953
00:59:52,390 --> 00:59:54,400
它会被带到哪儿 佛州?
Where are they gonna take him, Florida?

954
00:59:54,430 --> 00:59:55,530
亚洲吗?
Back to Asia?

955
00:59:55,560 --> 00:59:57,820
我有足够的麻醉药能...
I got enough flaxedil with me to put him out--

956
00:59:57,850 --> 00:59:58,910
- 制伏它 - 想都别想 不可以
- and I think I know a way - Forget it.

957
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:00,990
- 听我说 - 不可以
- Jack, hear me out. - Forget it.

958
01:00:01,020 --> 01:00:05,040
我知道我是个有钱的疯子
I know I'm a fat, rich, nut fuck, whacko who's about as grounded as a street pigeon,

959
01:00:05,070 --> 01:00:06,120
继续说
Keep going.

960
01:00:06,150 --> 01:00:08,540
这是罕见的巨鳄
But this thing...

961
01:00:09,530 --> 01:00:10,790
这里
Here?

962
01:00:11,990 --> 01:00:13,090
来到缅因州
Maine?

963
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:15,290
三十尺长
30 feet?

964
01:00:15,830 --> 01:00:18,260
你不认为这是个奇迹吗
Don't you think we're dealing with a bit of a miracle?

965
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:21,300
能活抓它才是个奇迹
Yeah. The miracle would be to take him alive.

966
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:22,850
要是能制伏它?
Yeah, but if we could neutralize him--

967
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:23,930
该怎么制伏它?
How are we gonna neutralize him?

968
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,850
把它引到陆地再打麻醉枪
Lure him on land and pump him full of drugs.

969
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:26,850
好
Oh, right.

970
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:28,350
波特兰有座空油缸
I know of an empty oil tank in Portland.

971
01:00:28,380 --> 01:00:30,560
可以把它养在那儿
If we drugged him, we could contain him there.

972
01:00:30,590 --> 01:00:32,940
它有一百五十岁
He's 150 years old.

973
01:00:33,890 --> 01:00:38,530
大概从亚洲游到缅因州
He probably swam here from another continent. He's migrated to Maine.

974
01:00:38,560 --> 01:00:40,740
它迁移到这儿 怎么能杀它
How the hell do we say we just kill it?

975
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:46,450
这只巨鳄是生态环境的奇迹
Jack, this thing being here does have some ecological significance.

976
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:49,670
你必须保护濒临绝种动物
And you are in the business of protecting things against extinction.

977
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:51,130
我也得保护警员
Including deputies.

978
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,590
我了解
I understand that,

979
01:00:52,620 --> 01:00:54,300
但我们能活抓它
but if it's possible to take him alive--

980
01:00:54,330 --> 01:00:55,380
不可能
No, it's not possible.

981
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:57,670
它都猎食动物
Look, he follows anything that moves, right?

982
01:00:57,700 --> 01:01:00,590
在岸上放诱饵 我有大渔网
We set a trap on the beach. I got enough net--

983
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:02,930
不行 绝对网不住它
No. There's no net that's gonna hold him.

984
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,720
只要等麻醉药生效就行
It'll keep him tangled long enough for the drugs to kick in.

985
01:01:05,750 --> 01:01:09,560
二十多尺的巨鳄都被活抓过
For God's sake, Jack, they've trapped crocs bigger than 20 feet.

986
01:01:09,590 --> 01:01:11,100
这并非不可能
This is not completely out of the question.

987
01:01:11,130 --> 01:01:12,440
你知道 这是可行的
It's possible, and you know that.

988
01:01:12,470 --> 01:01:16,730
你也知道佛州的人会杀死它
And those fucks from Florida won't even try, and you know that, too.

989
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:21,030
我有麻醉药 他有一把大枪
I got the drugs. He's got a big cannon if anything goes wrong.

990
01:01:22,980 --> 01:01:24,450
该怎么引诱它?
How do you get him to the net?

991
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:26,290
要毕太太叫它吗
Ask Mrs. Bickerman to call him?

992
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,620
你们拿着麻醉枪站在卡车上
You guys can be in the trucks with the tranq guns.

993
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:30,080
它一攻击就开车
If he charges, you take off.

994
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:31,580
它跑不过你
He's not that fast.

995
01:01:32,740 --> 01:01:34,040
试一试无妨
We just have to try.

996
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:39,000
只试一次就行
One try. Just one try.

997
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:43,970
我们该怎么诱它上岸
Like Hank says, how would we lure him in?

998
01:01:44,790 --> 01:01:46,310
我会告你的
I'll sue you!

999
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:47,430
尽管告
Go ahead.

1000
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:51,190
你不能抢走我的牛
You can't take a cow by eminent domain!

1001
01:01:51,220 --> 01:01:52,980
当然能
We just did!

1002
01:01:53,010 --> 01:01:55,560
它不会受伤的
We won't let her get hurt, ma'am.

1003
01:01:55,590 --> 01:01:57,320
你们全是王八蛋
You're all cocksuckers!

1004
01:01:57,350 --> 01:02:00,150
我早就知道了
I knew at first. I just didn't want to say it.

1005
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:02,400
我们很有把握
We know what we're doing.

1006
01:02:03,390 --> 01:02:06,110
牛被吊在直升机上
We got a cow hanging from a helicopter.

1007
01:02:08,110 --> 01:02:09,450
没什么风
Not much drag.

1008
01:02:09,480 --> 01:02:12,080
它不晃动就没事
As long as I can keep her from swinging, we're ok.

1009
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:23,260
这么做是对的
We're doing the right thing.

1010
01:02:23,290 --> 01:02:25,840
等你进了鳄鱼肚就会后悔
You might feel different if you get eaten.

1011
01:02:25,870 --> 01:02:27,550
是啊 谢了
Yeah, thanks.

1012
01:02:39,510 --> 01:02:41,400
大家都有麻醉枪
Tranq gun with every rifle.

1013
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:44,030
射程越远越好
That's as far back as it goes, right?

1014
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:56,000
赫克托 别让牛下水
All right Hector, keep enough tension to hold her up.

1015
01:02:56,030 --> 01:02:58,250
谁知道它会不会游泳
We don't know how well she can swim.

1016
01:02:58,280 --> 01:02:59,790
是啊
Right.

1017
01:03:06,620 --> 01:03:08,220
我不想说
I hate to say it.

1018
01:03:08,250 --> 01:03:10,680
不过它越晃动越好
The more she thrashes, the better.

1019
01:03:11,550 --> 01:03:13,230
你们准备好了吗
You ready on shore?

1020
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:15,430
我们准备好了
Yeah, we're all right. We're ready.

1021
01:03:16,010 --> 01:03:17,430
好了
Ok.

1022
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:22,190
牛累了就把它拉上来
If she gets tired, pull her out.

1023
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:27,160
它在干什么?
What's she doing now?

1024
01:03:27,190 --> 01:03:29,610
它想要飞
She's trying to fly.

1025
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:34,490
这头牛很不爽
This is not a happy cow.

1026
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:39,670
我希望巨鳄把你朋友全吃掉
I'm rooting for the crocodile. I hope he swallows your friends whole.

1027
01:03:39,700 --> 01:03:42,210
你尽管来逮捕我吧
You might want to arrest me for that, too.

1028
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:46,880
希望警察被吃掉犯法吗
Is that a crime--To wish the chewing of law enforcement?

1029
01:03:46,910 --> 01:03:49,380
我不确定
I'm not sure, ma'am.

1030
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:52,390
你抓到他了?
You got 'em?

1031
01:03:52,420 --> 01:03:53,720
这里
Yeah, over here.

1032
01:03:53,750 --> 01:03:55,730
在那儿
Little battery!

1033
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,940
怎么回事
What's the deal?

1034
01:03:57,970 --> 01:03:59,770
我们试过了
Well, we tried.

1035
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:02,650
再等一下子
Just a little longer, please.

1036
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:04,780
它好像没在游泳
She doesn't seem to be swimming.

1037
01:04:04,810 --> 01:04:08,570
它像个大茶包被泡在水里
No, she's floating. She looks like a giant tea bag.

1038
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:11,070
赫克托
Ok, Hector.

1039
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:13,410
没有动静 没戏唱了
Good plan, bad bait. Game's up.

1040
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,950
这头牛真令人失望
The cow disappoints me.

1041
01:04:17,990 --> 01:04:20,460
等一下
Hold on.

1042
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:22,170
有动静了
I got something on the screen.

1043
01:04:22,200 --> 01:04:23,960
有什么
What do you got?

1044
01:04:23,990 --> 01:04:25,170
它来了
He's coming.

1045
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:26,920
在哪儿
Where?

1046
01:04:26,950 --> 01:04:28,220
有多远
How far out?

1047
01:04:28,250 --> 01:04:29,340
大约三十米
30 meters or so.

1048
01:04:29,370 --> 01:04:31,850
它很慢 不过正游过来
He's moving slow, but he's definitely coming.

1049
01:04:31,880 --> 01:04:34,470
可以看到吗或只是雷达讯号
Can you confirm visually or just radar?

1050
01:04:34,500 --> 01:04:35,680
是雷达讯号
Radar.

1051
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:39,020
它在水底但往这儿过来
He's underwater, but he is coming!

1052
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:41,230
大伙儿上卡车
All right, everybody back in the trucks!

1053
01:04:41,260 --> 01:04:42,480
快点 快点
Move, move, move!

1054
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:43,610
我们走 我们走
Let's go, let's go!

1055
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:44,610
我们走
Let's go!

1056
01:04:44,640 --> 01:04:46,070
把它引过来
Lead him in.

1057
01:04:46,100 --> 01:04:47,980
来了
On our way.

1058
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:56,750
大家要瞄准腹部和侧面
Remember to aim for the stomach and the sides!

1059
01:04:56,780 --> 01:04:59,870
麻醉针穿不过鳄背
These darts won't pierce his back!

1060
01:05:01,070 --> 01:05:04,000
它浮出来了
He's surfacing. There's his snout.

1061
01:05:04,280 --> 01:05:06,000
在那儿
There he is!

1062
01:05:06,030 --> 01:05:08,010
看到它了
We've spotted him, Hector.

1063
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:10,130
你这小家伙
You little snacker.

1064
01:05:10,870 --> 01:05:13,140
太靠近就把牛拉起来
If he gets near her, pull up.

1065
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:15,140
她担心牛的安全
She's worried about the cow now.

1066
01:05:16,420 --> 01:05:18,850
慢慢来
Nice and slow, Hector.

1067
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:22,690
他的网子最好有用
This net thing better work.

1068
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,270
你不是被网过吗
He got you with it.

1069
01:05:26,220 --> 01:05:29,110
它在水下四尺
We're in about 4 feet of water now.

1070
01:05:30,390 --> 01:05:31,660
它在叫耶
She's mooing.

1071
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:33,370
你不会叫吗?
You wouldn't?

1072
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,160
它也在乱踢
She's also kicking.

1073
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:39,410
再靠近点
A little closer, Hector.

1074
01:05:49,120 --> 01:05:50,800
糟了
Oh, shit.

1075
01:05:56,130 --> 01:05:57,550
小心
Watch out!

1076
01:06:04,760 --> 01:06:06,230
王八蛋
Motherfucker!

1077
01:06:09,810 --> 01:06:11,650
可恶
Shit!

1078
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,440
他人呢
Where is he?

1079
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:15,950
我们得去救他
We gotta get to him.

1080
01:06:18,690 --> 01:06:20,000
支援我们
Back us up.

1081
01:06:20,030 --> 01:06:21,910
放下麻醉枪 用来福枪
Lose the tranq guns. go to the rifles.

1082
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:24,330
用来福枪
Get the rifles!

1083
01:06:42,090 --> 01:06:43,100
它在哪里
Where'd he go?

1084
01:06:43,130 --> 01:06:44,060
等等
Hold up.

1085
01:06:44,090 --> 01:06:45,810
别下水
Don't go back into the water.

1086
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:47,690
瞄准了就开枪
If you get a safe shot, take it.

1087
01:06:49,260 --> 01:06:51,650
赫克托 别动
Do not move, Hector!

1088
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:58,330
你看到什么吗
Can you see anything from out there?

1089
01:06:58,360 --> 01:06:59,740
没有
Nothing!

1090
01:07:00,230 --> 01:07:02,410
也许它游走了
Maybe he swam back out!

1091
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:06,460
天
Jesus!

1092
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:07,620
赫克托
Hector!

1093
01:07:08,530 --> 01:07:09,920
嘿
Hey!

1094
01:07:09,950 --> 01:07:11,170
快回到卡车上
Get back in the truck!

1095
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,380
我掩护他
I got him covered.

1096
01:07:19,460 --> 01:07:21,350
它在哪里
Where is he?

1097
01:07:21,380 --> 01:07:22,350
不知道
I don't know.

1098
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:23,850
它潜到水底
He's gone under.

1099
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:38,110
我现在觉得很安全
I just have this feeling everything's totally safe.

1100
01:07:42,070 --> 01:07:43,500
- 在那儿 - 它游走了
- There! - He's swimming out!

1101
01:07:43,530 --> 01:07:45,870
我看到它了 我看到它的尾巴
I think I see him! I think I see his tail!

1102
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:03,930
糟了 凯莉
Shit! Kelly!

1103
01:08:22,310 --> 01:08:23,740
凯莉!
Kelly!

1104
01:08:33,870 --> 01:08:36,380
快游过来
Kelly, swim, swim to me!

1105
01:08:36,410 --> 01:08:38,210
快游到我这边
Swim to me, Kelly!

1106
01:08:41,710 --> 01:08:43,470
快开枪呀
Shoot the fucking thing!

1107
01:08:43,500 --> 01:08:45,800
我瞄不准
I don't have a clean shot.

1108
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:48,770
潜下去
Dive under!

1109
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:50,230
潜下去
Go under!

1110
01:08:54,680 --> 01:08:55,940
操
Fuck.

1111
01:09:17,160 --> 01:09:18,550
让我们来拯救它
"Let's save him."

1112
01:09:18,580 --> 01:09:20,210
活抓它真是烂点子
What a fucking great idea.

1113
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:49,660
来
Come on.

1114
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:51,660
来
Here.

上来
Here we go.

1116
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:56,250
它在哪里
Where is he?

1117
01:09:56,280 --> 01:09:57,130
不知道
I don't know.

1118
01:09:57,160 --> 01:09:58,590
看不到它
We can't see him.

1119
01:09:59,620 --> 01:10:01,550
什么
What--What?

1120
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:08,720
赫克托
Hector!

1121
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:24,940
好吧
All right.

1122
01:10:25,190 --> 01:10:26,450
它玩完了
Game over.

1123
01:10:27,810 --> 01:10:29,200
看
Look.

1124
01:10:29,520 --> 01:10:31,410
它很痛苦
He's suffering.

1125
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,420
我让它安乐死
I get to be humane.

1126
01:10:34,450 --> 01:10:36,170
不行...
No, no!

1127
01:10:36,200 --> 01:10:38,460
它被困住了
No, no, no, look, he's trapped!

1128
01:10:38,490 --> 01:10:40,130
我们成功了
We've done it!

1129
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:43,470
不是被网住 不过它动不了
So what? It's not a net, but he's trapped.

1130
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:44,760
任务完成
Mission accomplished.

1131
01:10:44,790 --> 01:10:45,800
杀死它
Shoot him.

1132
01:10:45,830 --> 01:10:47,100
我还有麻醉药 它半死不活
I got more drugs. He's half dead.

1133
01:10:47,130 --> 01:10:49,680
它还活着 开枪
He's half alive. Shoot him!

1134
01:11:04,520 --> 01:11:06,490
麻醉药生效了
The drugs are kicking in.

1135
01:11:30,420 --> 01:11:31,720
看看它
Look at him.

1136
01:11:31,750 --> 01:11:33,060
它完了
He's done.

1137

汉克 开枪吧
Hank.

1138
01:11:34,630 --> 01:11:37,310
大家退后
All right, stand back.

1139
01:11:37,340 --> 01:11:39,350
不 警长
No, no, no, Sheriff I.

1140
01:11:39,590 --> 01:11:40,650
你看

1141
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:41,730

1142
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:42,820
它动弹不得
He's got nothing left.

1143
01:11:42,850 --> 01:11:45,070
向它开枪吧
Go ahead. Shoot him.

1144
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:55,330
真的吗
Really?

1145
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:57,170
- 杰克 我们... - 凯莉
- Jack, we don't-- - Kelly.

1146
01:11:57,200 --> 01:12:00,420
你不必杀死它 该死的 看看它

1147
01:12:05,000 --> 01:12:06,130
给我吧
Let me have that.

1148
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,760
它被制伏了
He's been neutralized.

1149
01:12:07,790 --> 01:12:09,010
别这样 它被困住了
Come on, Jack, he's trapped!

1150
01:12:09,040 --> 01:12:10,180
看看它 它动也不能动
Look at him! He can't move!

1151
01:12:10,210 --> 01:12:11,930
- 看看它 - 何必杀它呢?
- Look at him! - What's the point?

1152
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:13,430
你没必要杀它的
We don't have to do this.

1153
01:12:13,460 --> 01:12:15,100
求求你 别杀它
Jack, you don't have to. Please!

1154
01:12:30,730 --> 01:12:32,370
天啊
Oh, God!

1155
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:34,080
我死定了
He's got me!

1156
01:12:34,110 --> 01:12:35,370
天啊
Jesus!

1157
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:36,450
天啊
Jesus Christ!

1158
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:39,620
有两只巨鳄
Are there 2? I think there's 2.

1159
01:12:39,650 --> 01:12:41,250
我看到了
I can see that.

1160
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,790
它咬我
He bit me!

1161
01:12:42,820 --> 01:12:45,010
它咬我 有两只耶
He bit me! There's 2, there's 2!

1162
01:12:45,040 --> 01:12:46,290

I can count.

1163
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,590

No!

1164
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:58,680
又变成一只了
Back to one.

1165
01:13:01,970 --> 01:13:03,270
来吧
Go ahead.

1166
01:13:03,510 --> 01:13:04,770
绑起来
Flax him.

1167
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:15,910
他们总算来了
Oh, here they are.

1168
01:13:15,940 --> 01:13:18,120
来的正是时候 你们好啊
Just in time. Nice to see you.

1169
01:13:27,660 --> 01:13:30,800
你们得替这只鳄鱼治伤
We're gonna need to get this reptile some medical attention.

1170
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:35,510
我们用直升机困住它
We, uh...trapped him with our chopper.

1171
01:13:52,390 --> 01:13:53,320
波特兰
Portland?

1172
01:13:53,350 --> 01:13:54,570
对 到波特兰
Yes, Portland.

1173
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:58,500
到那儿再想办法安置它
They'll tank him there until we figure out something better to do.

1174
01:13:58,530 --> 01:14:00,790
警长
So, Sheriff, Sheriff,

1175
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:02,790
你轰掉巨鳄
you got to fire your big gun finally.

1176
01:14:02,820 --> 01:14:04,040
爽吗
Was it fun?

1177
01:14:04,950 --> 01:14:06,040
没那么爽
Overrated.

1178
01:14:06,070 --> 01:14:07,710
毕太太怎么说?
What'd Bickerman say?

1179
01:14:07,740 --> 01:14:10,970
她没说有两只巨鳄
Well, she didn't want to tell us about the second croc,

1180
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,590
她怕我们会把它轰死
'cause she was afraid we'd blow its head off.

1181
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:15,300
她猜得真准
Women's intuition.

1182
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,180
还有空位
We got room for one more.

1183
01:14:18,210 --> 01:14:19,800
最好有人跟来
Someone should probably go with him.

1184
01:14:21,760 --> 01:14:24,650
我得收拾东西
I'm still packing up some stuff,

1185
01:14:24,680 --> 01:14:25,940
但是
but, uh...

1186
01:14:27,850 --> 01:14:29,440
我去吧
I'll go.

1187
01:14:29,470 --> 01:14:33,950
你一定得写报告
So, I imagine you're gonna have a few reports to do.

1188
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:35,990
有需要尽管找我
If you need anything, let me know.

1189
01:14:36,020 --> 01:14:39,160
很高兴认识你
Yeah. It was nice meeting you.

1190
01:14:40,020 --> 01:14:43,080
别这么情绪化嘛
Gee, Hank, don't get all choked up.

1191
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:45,920
我拿你还是没辄
With you, I'm still mixed.

1192
01:14:45,950 --> 01:14:50,290
那就这样好了
Oh, well, then, just to offend you on principle, then.

1193
01:14:52,410 --> 01:14:54,010
再见
See you.

1194
01:15:04,050 --> 01:15:06,860
你想搭我的便车吗?
You want a ride in my truck?

1195
01:15:06,890 --> 01:15:09,480
前座放了东西
Oh, we just finished loading up the front of the truck.

1196
01:15:09,510 --> 01:15:10,900
要我拿走吗
Do you want us to take some stuff out?

1197
01:15:10,930 --> 01:15:12,650
不用了
No, no, that's all right.

1198
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:13,900
我想再待一会儿
I'm gonna be a little while anyway.

1199
01:15:13,930 --> 01:15:15,860
向这座湖道别
I want to go say good-bye to the lake.

1200
01:15:15,890 --> 01:15:18,240
你确定? 我不介意
You sure, because I don't mind--

1201
01:15:18,270 --> 01:15:21,620
我真的想多待一会儿
No. I actually want to stay a little longer.

1202
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:22,660
好吧
All right.

1203
01:15:22,690 --> 01:15:24,450
好
All right.

1204
01:15:27,450 --> 01:15:29,630
要是我去纽约
If I'm ever in New York, I'll...

1205
01:15:29,660 --> 01:15:31,170
是吗
Yeah.

1206
01:15:54,520 --> 01:15:58,070
缅因州男人都不会主动吗
So, does nobody ever make a move in Maine?

1207
01:16:01,110 --> 01:16:03,450
你只是把袋子移过去?
That's it? You slide your duffel bag?

1208
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:08,790
上车吧 去喝杯啤酒
Just...get in the truck. Go for a beer.

1209
01:16:08,820 --> 01:16:10,590
镇上有家酒吧
There's a good bar in town.

1210
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:12,590
一定很棒
Bet that's charming.

1211
01:16:12,620 --> 01:16:13,920
杯子干净吗
Are the glasses clean?

1212
01:16:13,950 --> 01:16:15,550
应该是吧
Mostly.

1213
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:18,260
你要一直碎碎念吗?
You gonna complain the whole time?

1214
01:16:18,290 --> 01:16:20,050
杰克
Jack.

1215
01:16:20,580 --> 01:16:22,260
开车吧
Start the truck.

1216
01:16:27,470 --> 01:16:30,430
我已经开始想念那些鳄鱼了
I already miss the crocodile.

1217
01:17:07,050 --> 01:17:09,640
# I wanna love ya #

1218
01:17:10,470 --> 01:17:12,860
# And treat you right #

1219
01:17:12,890 --> 01:17:15,150

咬咬妈咪的脚趾
Nibble mommy's toes.

# Is this love, is this love #

1237
01:17:57,180 --> 01:17:59,190
# That I'm feeling? #

1238
01:18:05,360 --> 01:18:07,660
# Oh, yes, I know, yes, I know #

1239
