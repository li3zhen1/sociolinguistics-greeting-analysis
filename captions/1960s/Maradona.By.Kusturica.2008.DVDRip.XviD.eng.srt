1
00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:08,002
God is the only being who,
in order to reign,

2
00:00:08,108 --> 00:00:10,702
doesn't even need to exist.
- Charles Baudelaire

3
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:26,053
Ladies and gentlemen!
On the guitar,

4
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:31,329
senor Diego Armando Maradona
from the world of cinema!

5
00:00:47,847 --> 00:00:49,314
Buenos Aires!

6
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:53,343
How are you?

7
00:01:00,927 --> 00:01:05,955
This is the song from
the movie called UNDERGROUND!

8
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:10,997
Jorge Luis Borges once wrote that

9
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:14,265
Argentinos remind him of
boats moored in harbours.

10
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:18,776
However, the brilliant writer hadrt
counted on Diego Armando Maradona.

11
00:01:19,512 --> 00:01:23,004
El Diego was moored to
his mother

12
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:24,575
only until he was born.

13
00:01:24,717 --> 00:01:27,914
After that, he resembled a boat
without a single rope on its deck.

14
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:31,814
Diego could easily be the hero

15
00:01:31,958 --> 00:01:33,687
from my first film
DO YOU REMEMBER DOLLY BELL?

16
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:36,261
And the Sarajevan suburb of Gorica

17
00:01:36,396 --> 00:01:38,330
could easily become
Fiorito of Buenos Aires.

18
00:01:38,865 --> 00:01:40,833
It wouldn't be hard to imagine Diego

19
00:01:40,967 --> 00:01:42,832
in WHEN FATHER WAS
AWAY ON BUSINESS,

20
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,095
playing the father,

21
00:01:44,237 --> 00:01:47,138
who atones for his adultery in prison
during politically turbulent times.

22
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:49,400
And nothing would be
easier than to see

23
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:53,574
the footballing magician

24
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:56,045
acting in BLACK CAT, WHITE CAT
as the man

25
00:01:56,182 --> 00:01:59,208
who is his own worst enemy,

26
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:01,786
doing everything to his own detriment.

27
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:49,231
This chapel is a creation of the members
of the Church of Maradona.

28
00:02:49,802 --> 00:02:54,501
It reflects, it symbolizes
the image of Diego among his own.

29
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:07,817
This ball represents
Diego's sacrifice for football.

30
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:28,464
We'd like to ask everyone to please
take their seats, to get into place,

31
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:33,409
because when
Diego Armando Maradona arrives,

32
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:37,141
we'll start the press
conference and give you

33
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:41,310
all the details concerning
the big march in Mar del Plata.

34
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:53,692
01,04,2005.

35
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:55,664
Buenos Aires, Argentina.

36
00:04:23,329 --> 00:04:25,854
I am very proud, as an Argentine,

37
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,798
to be riding on this train

38
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:34,134
and to repudiate that piece of
human garbage, George Bush.

39
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:38,142
So I want the people
of Argentina to understand

40
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,974
that we are going for dignity,

41
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:43,014
not for violence,
but to defend what is ours,

42
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:48,519
what is Argentina's, that's all.

43
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,792
It was miraculous that the planet Earth
wasrt knocked off its axis

44
00:04:55,928 --> 00:05:00,194
when more than a billion people
all leapt up at the same time.

45
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,393
That was the moment
when we celebrated Maradona's goal

46
00:05:03,536 --> 00:05:06,232
against England
at the World Cup in Mexico.

47
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:10,739
The Earth continued its undisturbed
journey around the Sun

48
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,674
because it was a leap for justice.

49
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,945
Even God himself
got involved in this case

50
00:05:16,082 --> 00:05:19,916
the first goal against the English
was scored with the player's hand

51
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:22,248
even though it was
a football championship.

52
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:24,523
It was one of those rare moments

53
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:28,457
when a country heavily
in debt to the IMF triumphed

54
00:05:28,594 --> 00:05:30,926
over one of the rulers of the world.

55
00:05:31,431 --> 00:05:35,595
For Argentina! Goal!

56
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:42,332
By Diego Armando Maradona!

57
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:46,935
A most poetic goal!

58
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:49,981
Symbolic! Unforgettable!
To be treasured forever!

59
00:05:50,116 --> 00:05:55,247
Diego Armando Maradona! The best
football player in the World Cup!

60
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,658
'WHO is that man? '
I asked myself.

61
00:06:03,796 --> 00:06:05,388
Who is that footballing magician?

62
00:06:05,531 --> 00:06:08,432
The Sex Pistols of
the international football scene.

63
00:06:08,568 --> 00:06:09,967
The cocaine victim, who,
having given up drugs,

64
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:13,664
looked first like a Falstaff

65
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,865
and then like
an advert for spaghetti.

66
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:17,805
If Andy Warhol were alive,

67
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,504
I'm sure he'd put Maradona in

68
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:23,240
his sepia alongside
Marilyn Monroe and Mao Tse-tung.

69
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:27,447
If he'd been able to spend his
whole life on the football pitch,

70
00:06:27,587 --> 00:06:29,487
he'd have been a happy man.

71
00:06:29,622 --> 00:06:33,058
As it was, as soon as the referee blew
for the end of the match,

72
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:36,491
and El Diego,
the greatest footballer of all time,

73
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,996
had walked past the corner flag,
heading for the changing rooms,

74
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:41,896
all his troubles began.

75
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,302
What do we say?

76
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,272
It's me Bizoo.

77
00:06:58,117 --> 00:06:59,084
Yes?

78
00:07:00,686 --> 00:07:04,349
It's... it's Emir with the...
with the crew.

79
00:07:04,857 --> 00:07:06,586
Hi, how are you?

80
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:08,752
Thank you.

81
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:11,295
- My daughter, Dunja.
- Nice to meet you.

82
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,830
I am very happy to see you.

83
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,330
Same here.

84
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,871
I cried twice because of him:

85
00:07:19,972 --> 00:07:24,068
When we lost
and when he beat England.

86
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,772
When we talk about
the match against England...

87
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:35,286
we talk about it like this.
Bilardo was very intelligent.

88
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,549
We were representing our dead

89
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:43,128
who were sent to die
by their own country.

90
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:48,825
It wasrt like England pushed
a button and killed everyone.

91
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:52,996
So we had to go out onto
the pitch and play football.

92
00:07:54,574 --> 00:07:57,873
Thinking about football,
but knowing that

93
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,377
a lot depended
on our beating England.

94
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,607
It was like a war,
winning a football war.

95
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,813
That's what spurred us on.

96
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,185
After the hand goal
against England,

97
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:16,628
everyone said: "That was great,
what you did to the English!",

98
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:18,821
while the others threw mud at me.

99
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:21,593
I was so thrilled with that goal,

100
00:08:21,734 --> 00:08:24,897
it was as if I'd stolen
an Englishmars wallet,

101
00:08:25,037 --> 00:08:27,767
it felt like getting away
with a prank!

102
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:29,932
This good-natured roly-poly looked

103
00:08:30,076 --> 00:08:33,773
more like a character from a film
about the Mexican revolution

104
00:08:33,913 --> 00:08:36,040
than the best footballer of all time.

105
00:08:36,549 --> 00:08:39,609
It was as if he had
stepped out of a Sergio Leone

106
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:41,242
or Sam Peckinpah's film.

107
00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:46,217
As if he had just said goodbye
to some ladies of ill repute

108
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,350
and stepped into a room,

109
00:08:48,494 --> 00:08:51,327
bringing the smell of
revolutionary gunpowder with him.

110
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:54,956
I was sure of one thing -
if he hadrt been a footballer,

111
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,160
he would have
become a revolutionary.

112
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:01,399
Maradona wouldn't need an incentive
to send him off into the woods.

113
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,566
He was a revolutionary at heart.

114
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,974
While everyone is defending
the U.S., I defend Cuba.

115
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:09,206
I don't care if it pleases people.

116
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:12,977
It would be much easier to say:
"Leave the U.S. Alone."

117
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:16,919
But I say the Americans
let the Yugoslavs kill each other

118
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,318
because there was no oil.

119
00:09:19,025 --> 00:09:20,720
Otherwise, they'd have moved in.

120
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:25,126
They were behind
the killings in Afghanistan.

121
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,900
That really disturbs me.

122
00:09:29,802 --> 00:09:34,830
We watch them
killing people on TV

123
00:09:34,974 --> 00:09:39,001
and the only ones
making money are CNN, Fox...

124
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,146
But Fidel is great.

125
00:09:43,015 --> 00:09:44,414
I have a tatoo of him.

126
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,180
And you have Che Guevara.

127
00:09:56,529 --> 00:09:57,518
Che Guevara, si.

128
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:00,931
See you tommorrow.

129
00:10:01,067 --> 00:10:02,364
- I see you...
- See you. Ciao, ciao.

130
00:10:05,871 --> 00:10:07,668
We could make
a nice movie out it.

131
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:09,373
Nice?

132
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:23,512
Yes. You sit here.

133
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,856
I won't be seen anyway.

134
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:46,574
There's nothing harder than when
you want to peer into someone's life

135
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:52,048
and yet at the same time understand
why he or she won't let you in.

136
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:55,950
It's like a never-ending game
where the doors are opening and closing.

137
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:59,980
When you yourself have been
persecuted by some journalists,

138
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,684
you begin to hate them.

139
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,625
Not only when they lie,

140
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,198
but also when they are trying to
ferret out the secrets of your life.

141
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,733
And now I'm intending to
present a portrait of

142
00:11:09,869 --> 00:11:12,838
one of the most famous people
on the planet

143
00:11:12,972 --> 00:11:15,600
and suddenly I am taking
on the role of

144
00:11:15,941 --> 00:11:18,239
those very people
I have never liked.

145
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:21,805
I feel like a paparazzo
waiting for a star to wake up

146
00:11:21,947 --> 00:11:25,041
and to step in front of
my camera lens,

147
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:28,085
so I can sell
the photos to the tabloids.

148
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:31,616
- They go somewhere else.
- Really?

149
00:11:31,757 --> 00:11:33,122
They're sitting in the car.

150
00:11:41,934 --> 00:11:43,196
This barbed wire crown

151
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:47,328
represents the pitch,
the field, the grounds.

152
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:16,294
The Goal of the Century

153
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,691
...naked aristocracy...

154
00:12:58,477 --> 00:12:59,967
He's awesome!

155
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:05,383
My best friend, a great brother,
he does everything for us.

156
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:08,146
You play for Argentino Juniors?

157
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:09,345
- Yes.
- What position?

158
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:10,682
Nine.

159
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:12,290
Will you be like Diego?

160
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,019
No, I've never thought that.

161
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:16,492
No?

162
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:20,125
My brother's a Martian.
No question about that.

163
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:23,226
Travelling through Fiorito to
Maradona's house

164
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,930
looked to me like the journey to
the setting of my first feature film

165
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,505
DO YOU REMEMBER DOLLY BELL?

166
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:31,499
While I was looking at
the shanties of poor,

167
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:35,740
it seemed to me that I knew every face
that was hiding behind the scenes.

168
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,582
While making DOLLY BELL,

169
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:41,345
I discovered the most wonderful
characteristics of city poor

170
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,281
the aristocratic spirit that had
vanished from the houses of the rich

171
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:47,518
and had moved to
the homes of the impoverished.

172
00:13:48,527 --> 00:13:51,462
The wonderful morality
within the family

173
00:13:51,597 --> 00:13:53,997
where rules are respected
and sacrifices made.

174
00:13:54,466 --> 00:13:56,991
Since then, I have always found

175
00:13:57,136 --> 00:13:59,468
it easy to recognize
that aristocratic spirit,

176
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:03,405
knowing that in the west,
poverty was an embarrassment,

177
00:14:03,542 --> 00:14:06,978
but here and in Balcans
it's an expression of suffering.

178
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,614
When he was choosing
between River Plate,

179
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:11,306
who were offering him
more money,

180
00:14:11,450 --> 00:14:14,544
and Boca Juniors,
Diego chose Boca

181
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:17,622
precisely for
these aristocratic reasons.

182
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:21,388
Boca were paying less money,
but by joining them,

183
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:28,057
he was fulfilling a dream
dating back to the time

184
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:32,227
he was walking past the
Bombonera stadium with his father

185
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,305
and promised that one day

186
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:41,113
Diego arrived at Boca's stadium
24 years later as a retired footballer,

187
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:42,578
carrying a torch, whose weak flame

188
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:47,709
shyly lit the road of return from
the underworld of drug addiction,

189
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:50,413
back to being among his football fans.

190
00:14:50,956 --> 00:14:53,220
Once a god, always a god.

191
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:57,722
That evening he reminded me
of the Mesopotamian god, Gilgamesh.

192
00:14:58,163 --> 00:15:02,327
The way in which Diego was
accepted only went to prove

193
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:04,800
that for gods all is forgiven.

194
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,270
My dad was the only one
who worked.

195
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:15,813
He had nine mouths to feed,
my mother and eight kids.

196
00:15:15,948 --> 00:15:17,779
We always had food on the table.

197
00:15:19,318 --> 00:15:23,254
Not much, sometimes more,
sometimes less,

198
00:15:23,389 --> 00:15:24,913
but we always had food.

199
00:15:25,057 --> 00:15:26,490
This is my house.

200
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:30,356
But that's what unites a family.

201
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:35,032
I'd share my food with my sister,

202
00:15:35,134 --> 00:15:38,900
or she'd give me some of hers
when she'd eaten enough.

203
00:15:39,238 --> 00:15:41,138
When was the last time
you've been here?

204
00:15:43,676 --> 00:15:46,474
Over 15 years ago.

205
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:50,810
We made paper balls
and we'd throw them out there.

206
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:55,882
This was the goal. We'd throw
the ball like this, and head it.

207
00:15:58,057 --> 00:16:00,617
The patio was my stadium...

208
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:06,725
I have two dreams:

209
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:12,534
To play in the World Cup
and to be a champion.

210
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:16,068
I realized later,
when I was much older,

211
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:20,342
that my mother,
whenever she'd see

212
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:24,472
there wasrt enough food,
would get a stomach ache.

213
00:16:25,784 --> 00:16:27,649
But it wasrt true,

214
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:30,745
it was because
she wanted us to have more.

215
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:35,219
At the table, my dad
didn't need to say: "Be quiet."

216
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:39,388
The look in his eyes,
the exhaustion from his work,

217
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,465
commanded respect.

218
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,763
I remember when my dad
came home from work

219
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:51,106
my mom would put
the old suction cups on his back.

220
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:56,444
It was a ritual, my mom
cupping and us all around.

221
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,486
It was like a massage.

222
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,817
Exactly,
because my dad carried sacks.

223
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:10,589
I think the people around here
have greater dignity

224
00:17:10,729 --> 00:17:15,598
than all the people
who may live in other areas.

225
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:18,202
In my country,
politicians get rich,

226
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:21,797
but give nothing to the people.

227
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:24,602
I've often been asked
to go into politics,

228
00:17:25,477 --> 00:17:29,470
and I say: "No, I don't want to
rob the people."

229
00:17:29,615 --> 00:17:31,776
I've met with politicians

230
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:34,685
and they never want to
meet with me again.

231
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:38,547
Because I say what I feel.

232
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:43,593
The gap between rich and poor
has grown much bigger in my lifetime.

233
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:47,756
Not only here in Argentina,
you can see it in Brazil,

234
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:51,961
or Venezuela or Cuba,
with the embargo.

235
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:55,301
The Americans are trampling
all over those countries,

236
00:17:55,441 --> 00:17:58,342
they won't let them
get back on their feet.

237
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:02,277
If they give them a loan,
they demand ten times more in return.

238
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:05,076
When was that
sense of justice born?

239
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,783
It comes from seeing the world,

240
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,549
and then from reading
a lot of Che Guevara,

241
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,215
and from studying. And from Cuba.

242
00:18:14,526 --> 00:18:16,118
Gabriel Garcia Marques told me:

243
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:19,196
If no Castro in the history
of Latin America,

244
00:18:19,331 --> 00:18:21,925
Yankees would have been
in Patagonia already

245
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:24,865
and all of you would have
spoken English already.

246
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:29,402
I think we're part of the U.S.

247
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:30,974
So, what does he think

248
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,702
the whole world will be
American colony?

249
00:18:32,845 --> 00:18:33,743
- Obviously.
- China?

250
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:35,039
No, not China.

251
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,950
I met Fidel in 1987.

252
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:42,784
The Americans gave me
an award

253
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:45,522
and the Cubans
were giving me an award.

254
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,390
I said to the Americans...

255
00:18:50,329 --> 00:18:53,355
"Keep your award,
I'm getting one in Cuba."

256
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,568
Fidel and I spent

257
00:18:56,702 --> 00:19:01,639
five hours talking about Che,
about Argentina, about Cuba,

258
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,475
and I fell in love with Fidel.

259
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:08,576
He seemed like a beast
defending his territory.

260
00:19:09,014 --> 00:19:11,676
He's the only politician
- if we can call him that -

261
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:16,947
who cannot be
accused of stealing,

262
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:20,350
though the Americans have tried.

263
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:25,863
He's the only politician
who can say:

264
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:29,331
"I risked my life for my country,
my land."

265
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:32,062
He's a revolutionary.

266
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:36,031
The politicians of the world
use money to win elections.

267
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,075
He won by taking up arms.

268
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,569
Because he's got balls!

269
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:44,813
I love Cuba!

270
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:54,821
Fidel!

271
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:02,266
It might seem scandalous,
but Fidel, I'd die for you!

272
00:20:03,969 --> 00:20:04,993
Listen!

273
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:11,005
The more I see
how people are in Europe,

274
00:20:11,777 --> 00:20:14,769
how people are in South America,

275
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:16,246
the more I love Cuba!

276
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:34,927
I think he didn't come to
Fiorito for last 14 years

277
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,900
because he prefered to
have idealistic image

278
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:39,936
or the picture of the poor people.

279
00:20:40,505 --> 00:20:43,167
It's better to keep them
in the mind, you know?

280
00:20:43,809 --> 00:20:47,643
To keep them as an idea
that he has to fight for,

281
00:20:48,213 --> 00:20:51,341
somehow, promote or be behind them.

282
00:20:51,483 --> 00:20:54,418
The good part of them will

283
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:57,147
vanish inmediately thinking about
his money,

284
00:20:57,289 --> 00:20:59,257
how to get money straight from him,

285
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:01,552
do you have hundred,
do you have two hundred,

286
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:04,594
and then they're not any more

287
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:07,631
as good as the idea about
good people is. You know?

288
00:21:07,766 --> 00:21:11,258
How do you feel coming back here

289
00:21:11,403 --> 00:21:15,772
and remembering the worst and
the most difficult part of your life.

290
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:20,238
Did you ever regret that you
left ever these beautiful fields.

291
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,873
This is the 'goalary'.

292
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:27,782
The 34 little balls
and the shoe represent

293
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,185
the 35 goals Diego scored
as a member of the Argentine team.

294
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:26,239
The Goal of the Century

295
00:22:56,641 --> 00:22:58,666
One day they wanted
to introduce me to Charles of...

296
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:06,409
of England.

297
00:23:07,452 --> 00:23:08,350
No.

298
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:16,085
I would never shake his hand.
Not with all that blood on it.

299
00:23:17,129 --> 00:23:19,029
Never.

300
00:23:19,598 --> 00:23:22,658
He wanted to meet me.
I didn't want to meet him.

301
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:29,097
After what happened
in the Falklands...

302
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:32,439
I didn't.

303
00:23:56,568 --> 00:23:57,535
Stop Bush

304
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,641
War Criminal

305
00:24:11,349 --> 00:24:12,873
He's a murderer.

306
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:17,844
I don't think he can just decide,

307
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:23,159
the way he decides for all of us,
for the whole world.

308
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:30,330
Having the most destructive bomb
doesn't mean having power.

309
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:36,304
Power doesn't mean
having a bomb

310
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:40,707
and killing five thousand people.

311
00:24:42,347 --> 00:24:45,475
In my opinion,
he's a cold-blooded murderer.

312
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:50,251
If you want,
we can talk about Bush.

313
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:54,256
He blames the Colombians
for cocaine.

314
00:24:55,293 --> 00:24:58,729
But in fact, it's the Americans
who use cocaine.

315
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:02,291
Right?

316
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:04,995
Yes!

317
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:08,305
What about the americanos?
They control all the drugs?

318
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:09,867
Obviously!

319
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:13,672
- Obviously.
- Obvious.

320
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:24,152
In the train that was
heading to Mar del Plata

321
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:30,159
there was something naive
but appealing about the idea that

322
00:25:30,295 --> 00:25:32,490
nowadays you can influence
the world and your own destiny

323
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,064
without money or
atomic bomb in your pocket.

324
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:39,465
It was a world where apparently
only at football matches

325
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:42,664
could the small nations triumph
epically over the larger powers

326
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:43,705
and take sweet revenge.

327
00:25:43,842 --> 00:25:48,438
It was as if that
unavoidable shudder which

328
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:51,014
trains produced in me
and the inexplicable excitement

329
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:52,946
were slowly turning into the belief

330
00:25:53,084 --> 00:25:55,814
that this train wasrt only heading
for Mar del Plata but beyond,

331
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:58,752
to better times for
Latin America.

332
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:10,620
Our Bible,
the one we cherish,

333
00:27:10,762 --> 00:27:13,890
the one we carry
in our hearts, everywhere.

334
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:07,946
Brother, after your conversion
to the Hand of God goal,

335
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:11,545
the Church of Maradona
welcomes you as a new disciple.

336
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:32,442
...Messiah back in Naples...

337
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:35,278
09,06,2005

338
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:16,278
"Anyone who
doesn't jump is Ferlaino."

339
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,463
The Neapolitans know

340
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:21,402
that I was the one
who enabled Naples to win.

341
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:26,065
When Ferlaino paid me, of course.

342
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:33,774
There was a feeling...

343
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:37,046
The feeling was that
the south couldn't beat the north.

344
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:40,013
They couldn't beat the north.

345
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:47,262
We went and played against
Juve in Turin

346
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:49,463
and scored six goals!

347
00:32:50,969 --> 00:32:52,800
Can you imagine

348
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:59,106
a southern team scoring six
against Agnelli "The Lawyer"?

349
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:02,741
Argentina eliminated Italy
from the World Cup.

350
00:33:03,915 --> 00:33:06,884
That was the biggest blow
in history for them.

351
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:11,850
Because Matarrese,
another Mafioso,

352
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:16,425
the president of the Italian league,

353
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:19,289
had already arranged the finals...

354
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:22,991
Germany and Italy.

355
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:29,196
And that's when everything
that happened, happened.

356
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:33,333
They got me out on doping.
Then they got Caniggia on doping.

357
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:38,749
But after that,
no one else.

358
00:33:39,283 --> 00:33:44,516
In Italian football, with the exception
of Maradona and Caniggia,

359
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,820
nobody even took an aspirin.

360
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:50,589
15,06,2005.

361
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:52,127
Belgrade, Serbia

362
00:34:06,544 --> 00:34:07,841
Stribor!

363
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:10,846
So you gonna meet Maradona.
You met him already?

364
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:11,949
No, never.

365
00:34:12,083 --> 00:34:16,782
Not many people can
the opportunity to meet God.

366
00:34:16,921 --> 00:34:19,014
IN the flesh.
So, it's special opportunity.

367
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:22,752
This is the first time I put the shirt
on because I'm meeting the God.

368
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:39,142
Come here, Stribor.

369
00:34:39,277 --> 00:34:40,835
Your little kid!

370
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,515
When Diego came,
Belgrade was grappling

371
00:34:47,652 --> 00:34:49,711
with the perplexing historical
lesson of how to love

372
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:52,084
the West once again after it
had bombed the town

373
00:34:52,223 --> 00:34:56,660
and destroyed it out of
fondness for the country.

374
00:34:57,428 --> 00:35:00,454
Diego looked at the ruined
Ministry of Internal Affairs building

375
00:35:00,598 --> 00:35:02,691
and asked me who had done it.

376
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:06,167
I didn't want to apportion collective
blame and say "the west",

377
00:35:06,304 --> 00:35:10,365
NATO, international community
or United States.

378
00:35:10,508 --> 00:35:14,069
Having been raised
in the educational spirit of the west,

379
00:35:14,212 --> 00:35:18,649
in my eyes culpability lies
in the actions of an individual.

380
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,774
"Havier Solana", I said,

381
00:35:20,918 --> 00:35:23,284
and Diego just
ironically nodded his head:

382
00:35:23,421 --> 00:35:26,356
"Si, sosialista espagnol"
(Yes, the Spanish socialist).

383
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:29,687
Senka, Maradona wants to
talk to you.

384
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:34,190
Hi, Senka. We love you!

385
00:35:34,699 --> 00:35:36,929
A big kiss!

386
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:39,834
It was no coincidence that

387
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:43,270
Diego was the last of my friends
to speak to my mother.

388
00:35:43,674 --> 00:35:46,734
The day after his visit,
my mother died

389
00:35:46,878 --> 00:35:50,211
and she took all her memories
with her to the afterlife,

390
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:52,782
including the joy
felt after Maradona's voice

391
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:55,852
had cheered her up
for a moment at least.

392
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,921
Red Star, Belgrade Stadium

393
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:00,724
The press room...

394
00:36:11,068 --> 00:36:14,196
The pitch is better
than on the day we played.

395
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:15,930
It was raining that day.

396
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,240
I'd swear it was this goal.

397
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:21,471
- This is the place.
- Qual?

398
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:23,512
- Aca.
- Yeah.

399
00:36:23,648 --> 00:36:25,047
This is where I take it...

400
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:38,789
I make an inside cut, a feint,
and take it again.

401
00:36:39,363 --> 00:36:41,160
A feint, and take it again.

402
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:42,590
It's up ahead.

403
00:36:43,434 --> 00:36:47,700
When I do this,
the goalie is here,

404
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:52,268
almost outside the penalty area.

405
00:36:53,277 --> 00:36:56,678
I feint, to kick hard, put my foot
under the ball to kick it over.

406
00:36:57,815 --> 00:37:00,579
It was complicated,
the goalie was tall,

407
00:37:01,485 --> 00:37:04,386
2 meters tall,
plus his hands over his head.

408
00:37:05,823 --> 00:37:11,318
But I was able to
get under it and kick it.

409
00:37:12,363 --> 00:37:14,024
Exactly. Like this...

410
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:17,363
Like this...
And the ball went like this...

411
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:21,663
I remember the goalie's face.

412
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:25,000
"Ciao!"

413
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:17,189
Did you see how
I play with this shoes?

414
00:38:17,328 --> 00:38:20,820
If I had the shoes...

415
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:22,559
It could be goal.

416
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,841
Hi, I'm Diego.

417
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:40,013
How are you? Good afternoon!
How's the family?

418
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:44,487
What's up, maestro?

419
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:45,919
Hey there, crazy guy!

420
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:48,048
See how they know me?

421
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:50,758
I'm in the neighborhood!

422
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:54,688
How are you? What's up?

423
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:58,394
Go, Boca, go!

424
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:10,642
- Three times.
- Three time, yes.

425
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:23,485
Look who's here! Who's that man?

426
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:25,022
My grandson.

427
00:39:30,501 --> 00:39:32,867
A good leg, a footballer's leg!

428
00:39:39,977 --> 00:39:43,435
When we were kids
we played football

429
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:46,978
and we never wanted to stop,

430
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:49,677
we wanted to keep playing.

431
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:53,881
We played at night
and could hardly see the ball.

432
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:55,451
You know?

433
00:39:56,327 --> 00:39:59,854
So what happened?
Playing in the dark

434
00:39:59,997 --> 00:40:04,525
and then in the daytime made
it seem as if you played better.

435
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:07,631
You see?
The night was here in our heads.

436
00:40:07,972 --> 00:40:10,907
And then,
imagining things the next day,

437
00:40:11,041 --> 00:40:13,976
we felt like we played
faster and better.

438
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:16,573
It's like a foggy day,

439
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:21,378
not being able to see the
entire goal, or half of the pitch,

440
00:40:21,552 --> 00:40:23,782
or the ball going out...

441
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:26,151
It's like playing
with closed eyes.

442
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:31,091
When you open them, you have
a much better idea of the pitch,

443
00:40:31,562 --> 00:40:34,895
of the goal, of your opponent.

444
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:41,889
The Goal of the Century

445
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:01,049
...if cocaine is a drug,

446
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,345
I am a drug addict...

447
00:42:04,154 --> 00:42:07,248
As we informed you yesterday,

448
00:42:07,391 --> 00:42:10,383
his hospitalization
in intensive care

449
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:14,225
is due to acute hypertension
and cardiac arrhythmia.

450
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:17,459
24 hours after being admitted,
Mr. Diego Maradona

451
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:19,034
is in a stable condition.

452
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,592
Black Cat, White Cat

453
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:10,415
I was dead.
But I didn't die because...

454
00:43:10,955 --> 00:43:14,254
the Man up there
didn't want me to.

455
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:17,026
But I was dead.

456
00:43:17,494 --> 00:43:22,124
It was like
all these black blood clots

457
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:26,366
prevented me from
opening my eyes.

458
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:34,568
It was terrible. I couldn't get out.

459
00:43:35,546 --> 00:43:38,310
I remember feeling that

460
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:42,548
I wanted to
get out of there, but couldn't.

461
00:43:43,153 --> 00:43:48,785
Do you understand? There
were all these black blood clots

462
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:56,395
and I couldn't get them
back into their pigeonoles

463
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:58,433
in order to wake up.

464
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:04,004
Later, Dalma told me
that Giannina kept saying:

465
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:08,168
"Daddy, you can't die, damn it!

466
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:10,179
You have to live,
to stay with me."

467
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:13,578
I didn't hear my daughter.

468
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:16,581
I was in a coma. I was dead.

469
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:20,553
Black Cat, White Cat

470
00:44:39,143 --> 00:44:42,203
What happened was
the Man up there said:

471
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:45,611
"Not yet. Not yet."

472
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:50,049
"You have to keep on fighting."
"Keep on fighting."

473
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,961
My journeys to Buenos Aires
turned to be in vain,

474
00:45:03,067 --> 00:45:06,503
and the thin line between life
and death along

475
00:45:06,637 --> 00:45:09,003
which Diego moved had
become his only route.

476
00:45:09,306 --> 00:45:11,001
That year he collapsed

477
00:45:11,141 --> 00:45:14,269
and in life he did everything
to his own detriment.

478
00:45:14,912 --> 00:45:18,075
Just as his footballing skills
were at one extreme,

479
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,740
with him being far
better than anyone else,

480
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,045
his life was at the other extreme,

481
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:25,621
being a disintegration of everything

482
00:45:25,756 --> 00:45:28,350
that provides the basis
for normality in life.

483
00:45:28,759 --> 00:45:32,820
I think this was why
they worshipped him no matter what.

484
00:45:32,963 --> 00:45:35,796
For normality is no longer
what people crave.

485
00:45:35,933 --> 00:45:37,264
It is simply too little,

486
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,529
and today everyone
wants much, much more.

487
00:45:40,671 --> 00:45:44,038
Normality is not a precondition
for love and adoration,

488
00:45:44,174 --> 00:45:46,301
and when someone
is reconciled to death

489
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:50,174
and when he or she speaks
from the heart as Diego does,

490
00:45:50,314 --> 00:45:52,339
the path to sainthood is nearby.

491
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:56,146
The only problem was that
it wasrt the time for sainthood,

492
00:45:56,286 --> 00:45:59,585
and that's why I think
he became a drug addict.

493
00:46:33,757 --> 00:46:37,022
- Good, but no tango?
- No.

494
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:47,695
- Do I look like tango?
- Yeah.

495
00:46:47,838 --> 00:46:48,805
Yes, tango.

496
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:59,442
I watched people congregating outside
cafes at dawn in Buenos Aires,

497
00:46:59,583 --> 00:47:02,074
listening to the tango
and crying together.

498
00:47:02,753 --> 00:47:07,087
The tango originated in 1883
in a bordello somewhere

499
00:47:07,224 --> 00:47:11,456
and Jorge Luis Borges calls it
dance of grieving husbands.

500
00:47:12,496 --> 00:47:16,125
The tango introduced
the idea of utter solemnity

501
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:18,962
as the dancers move backwards
and forwards.

502
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:21,164
The tango is the dance which

503
00:47:21,305 --> 00:47:25,674
most obviously suggests the union
between Thanatos and Eros.

504
00:47:26,610 --> 00:47:30,944
It is in this
ram-tam-tam-tam movement,

505
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:34,209
as elegant as death,
as powerful as birth,

506
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:36,842
that the basic elements of
life are united,

507
00:47:37,287 --> 00:47:40,552
and changes in form are
the best indicators of

508
00:47:40,691 --> 00:47:42,750
how time corrects thoughts

509
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:47,728
and how we all risk speaking nonsense
whenever we open our mouths.

510
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:53,935
The fact that the tango originated
in the bordello of yesteryear

511
00:47:54,071 --> 00:47:56,505
gives it an innocence that could

512
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,336
never be found
in the bordello of today.

513
00:48:13,657 --> 00:48:17,218
I became a sponsor
of the Church of Maradona

514
00:48:17,361 --> 00:48:20,228
mainly to support
and stay in touch with

515
00:48:20,364 --> 00:48:23,197
everything having to
do with Diego.

516
00:48:23,367 --> 00:48:26,393
I own the Cocodrilo
in Buenos Aires.

517
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:30,404
I got involved with the kids
in the Church of Maradona

518
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:31,768
a couple of years ago

519
00:48:31,909 --> 00:48:33,706
because of the wonderful things

520
00:48:33,844 --> 00:48:36,369
they were doing
for my friend Diego.

521
00:48:37,314 --> 00:48:40,681
The Cocodrilo has
an international reputation.

522
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:42,748
It's a nightclub

523
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:47,414
but we've gone further,
left the old-time nightclub behind.

524
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:52,017
In the Cocodrilo you have
girls dancing on the bar.

525
00:48:52,996 --> 00:48:55,931
They do shows,
they dance all night long.

526
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:59,331
As you can see, these girls

527
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:02,700
aren't strippers, they're dancers.

528
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:08,935
After a visit to
the Cocodrillo club,

529
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:12,378
the fundamental principles
of psychiatry were shaken.

530
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:16,751
Jung's theory is that the
survival instinct leads a man to food,

531
00:49:16,887 --> 00:49:20,482
and Freud claims that eros
is the basic impulse which,

532
00:49:20,624 --> 00:49:24,321
through sexual activity,
ensures species reproduction.

533
00:49:25,062 --> 00:49:26,996
In choosing Maradona's goals
as more tempting

534
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:31,931
than Omar's ballerinas
and the sumptuous feast,

535
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:34,902
I realised that Borges was right
when he claimed

536
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:37,063
that the tango originated in bordellos;

537
00:49:37,207 --> 00:49:41,576
whether it is called rock 'r roll or
the tango is today of no consequence.

538
00:49:41,945 --> 00:49:43,742
The most important thing
is the realisation

539
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,178
that a new psychiatric influence

540
00:49:46,316 --> 00:49:49,217
must be added to Jung's
survival instinct

541
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:52,345
and Freud's ideas on
species reproduction

542
00:49:52,489 --> 00:49:54,650
the influence of Maradona's game

543
00:49:54,791 --> 00:49:58,784
as the third of the important feelings
that drive mankind.

544
00:49:59,896 --> 00:50:02,160
Emir! You're like everyone else!

545
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:04,233
The girls always complain!

546
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:08,168
When Diego arrives
or we show videos of his goals

547
00:50:08,305 --> 00:50:10,273
all the men are like this,

548
00:50:10,407 --> 00:50:12,238
ignoring the girls, who say:

549
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:15,038
"Please Omar, turn off the TV!"

550
00:50:15,178 --> 00:50:18,705
And it's the same with Emir.
When you can see Maradona...

551
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:21,010
Well, let's enjoy the meal!

552
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:41,626
Uruguayan...

553
00:50:42,406 --> 00:50:44,601
Hi, how are you?

554
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:47,440
Good?

555
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,041
How are you?

556
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:50,913
My mother...

557
00:50:52,582 --> 00:50:53,571
My father...

558
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:11,865
Hey, are you deaf?

559
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:21,505
To Puebla!

560
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:28,046
Look at that goal. What a goal!

561
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:40,690
I would have been happy,

562
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:45,530
so happy to just
spend time with Dalma

563
00:51:46,970 --> 00:51:48,460
when she'd come to wake me up,
and not be afraid of her.

564
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:51,735
Dalma would come
wake me up: "Dad..."

565
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:54,469
Why? Because I was drugged out.

566
00:51:55,979 --> 00:51:59,745
Giannina would slap me
and I wouldn't feel anything,

567
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:01,345
I was on drugs.

568
00:52:04,354 --> 00:52:07,585
That's what
would have made me happy,

569
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:12,587
seeing my daughters grow up,
like her.

570
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:16,426
I envy Claudia.

571
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:21,796
I'm better-Iooking than she is,
but...

572
00:52:23,206 --> 00:52:26,642
The difference is
that Claudia

573
00:52:27,377 --> 00:52:30,778
shared those precious moments
with Dalma and Giannina.

574
00:52:32,182 --> 00:52:33,240
You see?

575
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:36,716
Now when I watch them
in the videos

576
00:52:36,853 --> 00:52:39,754
that Claudia sometimes
shows me,

577
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:42,120
I say: "Look what I missed."

578
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:47,624
"What an asshole I was
to have missed all that!"

579
00:52:50,467 --> 00:52:52,435
Because you can't go back.

580
00:52:53,236 --> 00:52:57,195
I spoiled what's most valuable,
the sentimental value...

581
00:52:58,141 --> 00:53:00,609
The guilt I feel inside,

582
00:53:02,712 --> 00:53:04,646
that's what I feel today,

583
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:11,287
the fact that I never spent an
ordinary birthday with Giannina

584
00:53:11,821 --> 00:53:16,884
or an ordinary birthday
with Dalma. Why not?

585
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:19,860
Because when the party began
I'd go and get high.

586
00:53:22,566 --> 00:53:24,727
And what did I feel? Nothing.

587
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:27,194
I felt they were my daughters,

588
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:33,476
but I didn't feel them next to me,
that we could hug each other.

589
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:39,472
I felt that my daughters
could tell I was on drugs.

590
00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:43,983
Dalma,

591
00:53:44,621 --> 00:53:47,089
when I'd go to kiss her,
would go like this.

592
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:53,085
The other one, no.

593
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:57,166
The chubby one, the little one,
with her character,

594
00:53:57,267 --> 00:54:00,725
would come over, would give me
would lie down with me.

595
00:54:00,870 --> 00:54:02,497
But not the other one.

596
00:54:04,474 --> 00:54:06,442
When Diego
entered difficult times,

597
00:54:06,576 --> 00:54:09,636
his wife Claudia turned into
his guardian angel,

598
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:12,907
into a woman who
held the keys to his family fortress.

599
00:54:13,383 --> 00:54:15,351
Without returning to that fortress,

600
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:17,817
Diego would certainly
not have survived.

601
00:54:18,188 --> 00:54:21,954
Although as my films prove,
I can't pretend to know women well,

602
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:25,721
in the case of Maradona's
it was easy for me to see that

603
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:28,490
saying that behind every
successful man stands a woman,

604
00:54:28,632 --> 00:54:30,463
is an empty phrase.

605
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:32,530
Once I asked Claudia

606
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:34,660
how Diego had
managed to survive,

607
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:38,035
she replied no one asked me
how I have survived.

608
00:54:38,174 --> 00:54:41,473
This only conform how limited
my knowledge of women is.

609
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:44,739
However I realized
that Claudia's battle for Diego

610
00:54:44,881 --> 00:54:46,439
was not only driven by love,

611
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:49,609
but also by
an unusual religiousness.

612
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:53,347
In a slum I was born,
It was God's will

613
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:55,549
That I grow up and survive

614
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:59,253
This humble example to
face adversity

615
00:54:59,396 --> 00:55:04,197
Eager to succeed in life
With each step I took

616
00:55:05,001 --> 00:55:08,528
On the playground
I forged an immortal left hand

617
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:12,199
With experience
A burning ambition to make it

618
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:15,140
As a young buck,
I dreamed of the World Cup

619
00:55:15,278 --> 00:55:19,044
And rising to the top in Primera

620
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:26,988
Perhaps by playing
I could help my family

621
00:55:27,557 --> 00:55:30,025
From the very outset

622
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:33,024
The Doce cheered...

623
00:55:34,531 --> 00:55:37,398
My dream contained a star

624
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:40,730
Full of goals and dodges

625
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:43,096
And all the people sang

626
00:55:44,908 --> 00:55:46,899
The "Hand of God" was born

627
00:55:48,445 --> 00:55:51,414
Sowed joy in the people

628
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:54,849
Brought glory to this land

629
00:55:55,819 --> 00:55:59,118
Bearing a cross on my shoulders
for being the best

630
00:55:59,255 --> 00:56:02,588
For not selling out
I confronted the powerful

631
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:06,093
Curious weakness
If Jesus stumbled

632
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:09,198
Why shouldn't I too?

633
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:12,827
Fame introduced me to
a white woman

634
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:16,370
Of mysterious taste
And forbidden pleasure

635
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:19,805
Who addicted me to
the desire to use her again

636
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:22,639
Taking my whole life

637
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:26,240
And this is a match that someday

638
00:56:26,850 --> 00:56:30,377
I am going to win

639
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,078
From the very outset

640
00:56:33,723 --> 00:56:35,418
The Doce cheered...

641
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:40,321
My dream contained a star

642
00:56:40,463 --> 00:56:43,899
Full of goals and dodges

643
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:45,762
And all the people sang

644
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,338
The "Hand of God" was born

645
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:53,637
Sowed joy in the people

646
00:56:54,377 --> 00:56:57,505
Brought glory to this land

647
01:00:44,340 --> 01:00:45,932
I love you all!

648
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,941
- You don't want to go?
- No.

649
01:00:59,188 --> 01:01:00,621
Cocaine,

650
01:01:02,058 --> 01:01:07,052
instead of doing me good,
making me feel better,

651
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:09,261
shut me up inside of myself.

652
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:13,961
And any questions I had,

653
01:01:14,871 --> 01:01:17,431
when I wanted to ask Claudia,

654
01:01:17,573 --> 01:01:20,371
I kept them inside
and didn't know the answers.

655
01:01:20,743 --> 01:01:25,680
Loneliness, you're filled
with bitterness, Ioneliness,

656
01:01:25,815 --> 01:01:29,114
nostalgia,
that's what it gives you.

657
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:33,850
It was all inside me,
inside this body.

658
01:01:34,157 --> 01:01:37,854
That was my biggest burden.

659
01:01:40,897 --> 01:01:44,264
A thousand times,
the old lady tried to get me to stop,

660
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:46,827
tried to talk to me.

661
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:51,438
She wanted to ask me things
and when she did

662
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:55,603
I'd even lie to her,
because of the coke.

663
01:01:56,279 --> 01:02:02,582
In the name of La Tota,

664
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:07,921
Don Diego,
and the fruit of their love,

665
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:14,463
Diego.

666
01:02:14,597 --> 01:02:17,794
We are gathered together
in this Maradonian Temple

667
01:02:18,701 --> 01:02:21,135
to reaffirm the commitment and love,

668
01:02:21,270 --> 01:02:25,001
through the Church of Maradona,
of our brother and sister,

669
01:02:26,142 --> 01:02:28,770
Gabriel Diego Chepenecas

670
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:31,038
and Alejandra Diego Troilo.

671
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:35,514
They both vow, before this altar
and cradle of Diego himself,

672
01:02:35,651 --> 01:02:38,779
to keep Maradonian faithfulness
and to declare

673
01:02:38,921 --> 01:02:42,379
that Diego was, is and will be
the god of football.

674
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:44,652
Our Diego who art on the pitch,

675
01:02:44,794 --> 01:02:46,955
Hallowed be thy left hand.

676
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:50,065
Thy magic come,

677
01:02:50,199 --> 01:02:52,667
Thy goals remembered
on earth as they are in Heaven.

678
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:54,736
Give us this day our daily joy

679
01:02:54,871 --> 01:02:56,862
and forgive those journalists,

680
01:02:57,006 --> 01:02:59,702
As we forgive the Neapolitan Mafia.

681
01:02:59,842 --> 01:03:01,742
Lead us not into temptation,

682
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:04,438
Deliver us from Joao Havelange.
Diego.

683
01:03:04,881 --> 01:03:08,612
For 20 years,
during Havelange's presidency,

684
01:03:08,751 --> 01:03:10,719
Brazil did not win the championship.

685
01:03:11,687 --> 01:03:14,986
You know why?
The Man up there is just.

686
01:03:16,325 --> 01:03:18,088
The Old Man loves justice!

687
01:03:18,227 --> 01:03:20,286
Lf, for 20 years,

688
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:25,198
a Mafioso was unable to
win the World Cup,

689
01:03:25,334 --> 01:03:26,767
kind of tough, isn't it?

690
01:03:28,004 --> 01:03:30,438
I'm going to tell you the story.

691
01:03:30,873 --> 01:03:32,932
Argentina was eliminated
from the World Cup.

692
01:03:34,811 --> 01:03:37,780
We went to play against Australia.

693
01:03:38,548 --> 01:03:40,015
It was a tie, 1-1.

694
01:03:40,149 --> 01:03:43,949
We came back here
and we qualified, 1-0.

695
01:03:44,854 --> 01:03:46,446
There was no doping case.

696
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:52,025
No drugs.
Not over there, not over here.

697
01:03:52,762 --> 01:03:55,595
There was no ephedrine
over there or over here.

698
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:58,666
No cocaine over there or over here.

699
01:04:00,336 --> 01:04:01,928
During the World Cup

700
01:04:03,172 --> 01:04:07,336
after we beat Nigeria, 2-1,
they said:

701
01:04:07,476 --> 01:04:09,444
"They're screwing us up."

702
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:14,607
I'd say Havelange
is the arms dealer,

703
01:04:14,750 --> 01:04:16,775
and Blatter sells the bullets.

704
01:04:20,323 --> 01:04:21,517
Alejandra,

705
01:04:22,358 --> 01:04:26,351
do you swear eternal love to
your partner Gabriel,

706
01:04:26,495 --> 01:04:29,828
faithfulness to
the Maradonian Church's principles,

707
01:04:29,966 --> 01:04:32,662
declaring that Diego,
our god of football was,

708
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:36,795
is and will be
the best player of all time?

709
01:04:37,173 --> 01:04:38,572
Yes, I swear.

710
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:40,807
Gabriel Diego,

711
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:45,840
do you swear eternal love to
your partner Alejandra Diego,

712
01:04:45,982 --> 01:04:48,780
and faithfulness to
our Church's principles?

713
01:04:48,918 --> 01:04:50,215
Yes, I swear.

714
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:54,212
The Church of Maradona
declares you man and wife.

715
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:56,056
You may kiss the bride.

716
01:05:03,065 --> 01:05:04,726
Remember,
the ball doesn't get dirty.

717
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:25,417
Goal!

718
01:06:23,612 --> 01:06:26,775
The Goal of the Century

719
01:06:46,068 --> 01:06:48,969
...when God became showman...

720
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:35,612
I'm an actor.

721
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:42,617
I live life the way
I want to live it.

722
01:07:44,326 --> 01:07:51,061
Actors are given a text
and they read it.

723
01:07:52,034 --> 01:07:54,867
I don't read it. I live it.

724
01:07:56,505 --> 01:08:00,236
That's my performance.
I live my life.

725
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:06,806
Is there any actor in the history
of cinema that you wanted to be?

726
01:08:06,949 --> 01:08:08,246
De Niro.

727
01:08:08,884 --> 01:08:11,216
- Raging bull?
- Yes.

728
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:14,288
I see him...

729
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:18,420
breaking everything!

730
01:08:21,330 --> 01:08:24,561
In fact, I identify
with a lot of things.

731
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:28,964
With what the guy thinks.

732
01:08:29,638 --> 01:08:33,039
With his desire to
destroy everything in his way.

733
01:08:35,277 --> 01:08:36,767
I identify with all that.

734
01:08:36,912 --> 01:08:41,008
It's just that he's a boxer
and I'm a football player.

735
01:08:41,150 --> 01:08:43,118
That's the difference.

736
01:08:45,054 --> 01:08:48,182
He wants to break everything,
I want to score goals.

737
01:08:53,863 --> 01:08:55,524
- How are you, Emir?
- Good, good.

738
01:08:56,398 --> 01:08:57,558
This is for you.

739
01:08:58,634 --> 01:09:00,101
Thank you very much, Emir.

740
01:09:02,104 --> 01:09:03,196
When did you arrive?

741
01:09:03,339 --> 01:09:04,931
Two days ago. On your birthday.

742
01:09:06,642 --> 01:09:08,303
I came to finish the movie with him.

743
01:09:12,848 --> 01:09:14,213
Y he has to work?

744
01:09:14,350 --> 01:09:15,214
Yes, little bit.

745
01:09:15,351 --> 01:09:17,342
Oh, no!

746
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:20,382
Little bit to make
a best movie of him all the time.

747
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:26,724
We have to go to Mar del Plata...

748
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:29,827
Have you been with Fidel?

749
01:09:29,999 --> 01:09:32,729
- NO, I go... I go next week.
- Ah, si?

750
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:35,900
- But you've been with Fidel? No?
- Yes!

751
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:45,207
We'll be happy to know
you're over there.

752
01:09:45,714 --> 01:09:48,512
Let me tell you, just between us

753
01:09:48,651 --> 01:09:50,915
and no one else...

754
01:09:51,053 --> 01:09:53,920
No one but the 8 million people
watching us.

755
01:09:55,257 --> 01:10:00,058
If I were the honorable president of
the United States, I wouldn't go!

756
01:10:09,605 --> 01:10:12,597
I am following Diego's charisma
in this movie also.

757
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:14,766
In certain period before
we spoke about that

758
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:15,842
people need somebody to lead them

759
01:10:16,278 --> 01:10:22,274
becuse the leaders of the world today
they are not good enough.

760
01:10:22,918 --> 01:10:25,751
But one moment he asked me:
But who is the leader?

761
01:10:26,855 --> 01:10:28,618
This time I think
he is the leader.

762
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:31,752
We set off on these journeys
with high hopes

763
01:10:31,894 --> 01:10:34,294
that as small nations

764
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:37,456
our trains would end up
on the main line.

765
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,062
I remember as boys,
we jumped onto the trains

766
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:43,228
heading from the suburbs
to the centre.

767
01:10:43,372 --> 01:10:44,771
As we were growing up,

768
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,841
we remembered
the sleepless nights

769
01:10:46,976 --> 01:10:49,376
for the shadows of
the train compartments,

770
01:10:49,511 --> 01:10:52,912
which flickered on
the ceilings of our pitiful flats.

771
01:10:53,549 --> 01:10:55,642
They were the same games
of light and darkness,

772
01:10:55,784 --> 01:10:57,217
noise and quiet,
as those of the trains on

773
01:10:57,353 --> 01:11:00,322
which people were transported

774
01:11:00,456 --> 01:11:03,653
by the fascist regimes to
their places of execution,

775
01:11:03,792 --> 01:11:07,159
and by the Bolsheviks to
serve their hefty sentences.

776
01:11:07,296 --> 01:11:16,637
When Father Was Away
on Businesss

777
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:22,173
They were long,
meandering trains,

778
01:11:22,311 --> 01:11:24,370
whose light momentarily lit up

779
01:11:24,513 --> 01:11:27,744
the faces of the girls
who taught us to kiss,

780
01:11:27,883 --> 01:11:31,080
and while the shadows
flashed across naked bodies,

781
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:34,519
those trains took us
back to the arms of our wives,

782
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:37,421
of the children we
hadrt seen for a long time,

783
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:39,151
to warm embraces,

784
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:43,061
whether we be political prisoners
or non-believers.

785
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:59,146
When Father Was Away
on Businesss

786
01:12:22,805 --> 01:12:26,206
...a force of God...

787
01:13:12,321 --> 01:13:13,982
Son of a bitch!

788
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:17,481
You suck!

789
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:42,636
What a racket!

790
01:14:42,778 --> 01:14:46,305
Long live the peoples of
Latin America and the Caribbean!

791
01:14:48,217 --> 01:14:50,310
Long live Argentina!

792
01:14:51,386 --> 01:14:52,853
The rain is going away.

793
01:14:54,456 --> 01:14:57,789
I was told by our friend

794
01:14:58,961 --> 01:15:01,191
Blanca Chancoso

795
01:15:02,798 --> 01:15:06,564
that if you blow 3 times
the rain will go away.

796
01:15:07,803 --> 01:15:09,964
We have to blow upwards 3 times...

797
01:15:14,877 --> 01:15:16,037
and the rain will go away.

798
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:22,378
And we will remain,
the peoples of America!

799
01:15:23,485 --> 01:15:28,047
In the ALBA Express came
the driver, Diego Armando Maradona.

800
01:15:29,191 --> 01:15:31,489
He came here
in the ALBA Express train.

801
01:15:41,436 --> 01:15:43,165
Come on up, Diego!

802
01:15:47,209 --> 01:15:49,336
Say something to these people,
Diego!

803
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:52,804
I love you!
Thank you for being here.

804
01:15:53,715 --> 01:15:57,549
Argentina has great dignity.
Let's kick out Bush!

805
01:15:59,021 --> 01:16:00,784
Long live Diego!

806
01:16:00,923 --> 01:16:03,824
Long live Maradona!
Long live the people!

807
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:08,825
It's stopped raining.

808
01:16:10,999 --> 01:16:13,661
Just in case,
we'll blow one more time.

809
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:23,011
Evo, a big welcome!
Come on up, brother!

810
01:16:23,812 --> 01:16:25,575
Say something to the people!

811
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:29,543
Thank you, comandante!

812
01:16:29,685 --> 01:16:34,054
Revolutionary greetings to all
the anti-imperialists of Latin America.

813
01:16:34,389 --> 01:16:38,951
Good luck! Keep on fighting
to free Latin America! Thank you.

814
01:16:41,296 --> 01:16:45,164
We've come here today
to do many things.

815
01:16:46,034 --> 01:16:49,026
And we have all brought
a shovel with us.

816
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:54,332
A gravedigger's shovel!

817
01:16:54,910 --> 01:16:57,242
Because here in Mar del Plata

818
01:16:57,379 --> 01:17:00,246
we are digging
the grave of the FTAA!

819
01:17:05,053 --> 01:17:07,351
The grave of the FTAA!

820
01:17:30,178 --> 01:17:34,512
The Argentine victory
over the English

821
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:37,551
in 1986 in Mexico brought
Diego his first world title.

822
01:17:38,053 --> 01:17:39,987
Justice triumphed and
at that time it was a justice

823
01:17:40,122 --> 01:17:43,114
that was only attainable
through football.

824
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:44,649
Mar del Plata was not just

825
01:17:44,793 --> 01:17:47,387
an emotional reaction
by the Latin Americans,

826
01:17:47,529 --> 01:17:50,987
against whom the CIA organised
coups d'etat and military juntas,

827
01:17:51,133 --> 01:17:55,160
and filled stadiums with civilians,

828
01:17:55,303 --> 01:17:57,100
who would later be executed.

829
01:17:57,239 --> 01:17:59,139
It was not only because of
the Nazi war criminals

830
01:17:59,274 --> 01:18:01,174
who went unpunished
after the Second World War

831
01:18:01,309 --> 01:18:04,506
and were smuggled to
North America

832
01:18:04,646 --> 01:18:07,171
and later dispersed
throughout Latin America,

833
01:18:07,315 --> 01:18:11,183
becoming advisors to dictators,
organising dissidents,

834
01:18:11,319 --> 01:18:13,287
and killing socialist leaders.

835
01:18:13,422 --> 01:18:17,791
In Mar del Plata, Latin America
refused to sign the ALCA agreement,

836
01:18:17,926 --> 01:18:22,590
the foundation for which being the
liberalisation of imports and exports,

837
01:18:22,731 --> 01:18:24,289
but which was
actually a cover for

838
01:18:24,433 --> 01:18:27,368
the economic subjugation
of Latin America.

839
01:18:27,502 --> 01:18:31,370
As was the agreement Mexico
signed in 1983.

840
01:18:31,873 --> 01:18:33,841
That agreement was
called the NAFTA

841
01:18:33,975 --> 01:18:37,570
and it was a marriage
between North America, and Mexico.

842
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:40,273
The USA and Canada
invested money

843
01:18:40,415 --> 01:18:43,782
and thousands of jobs were
opened up for the Mexicans.

844
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:46,016
Everything would have been alright

845
01:18:46,154 --> 01:18:50,113
if the profits had stayed in Mexico
and hadrt gone to the north,

846
01:18:50,258 --> 01:18:53,318
leaving only the workers' salaries
in Mexico.

847
01:20:37,732 --> 01:20:40,997
The Goal of the Century

848
01:20:59,187 --> 01:21:00,586
07,03,2007.

849
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:02,121
Buenos Aires, Argentina.

850
01:21:29,351 --> 01:21:31,080
So, two years later...

851
01:21:32,621 --> 01:21:37,058
in march 2005
we started this movie

852
01:21:37,192 --> 01:21:39,660
and at the hotel we were wondering

853
01:21:39,794 --> 01:21:42,627
if we are going to
have access to Maradona.

854
01:21:42,764 --> 01:21:45,096
We were dreaming
who Maradona is

855
01:21:46,268 --> 01:21:48,395
and we are still at the same place.

856
01:21:52,774 --> 01:21:53,968
What happened?

857
01:21:54,943 --> 01:21:56,740
Nobody knows...

858
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:17,024
The decompensation was
mainly the result of disorders

859
01:22:17,132 --> 01:22:19,498
related to eating, which
includes alcohol consumption.

860
01:22:19,634 --> 01:22:21,431
Alcohol is a drug.

861
01:22:21,569 --> 01:22:25,403
It's a case of decompensation.
No other dangerous drugs.

862
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:56,866
Really! It was fantastic!

863
01:22:57,339 --> 01:23:00,900
I felt good on the pitch
because I felt important,

864
01:23:01,042 --> 01:23:03,067
as if I really helped the team.

865
01:23:03,211 --> 01:23:06,647
I don't want to be dramatic,
but they cut off my legs.

866
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:22,054
If someone makes a mistake,
football shouldn't pay for it.

867
01:23:22,530 --> 01:23:25,465
I made a mistake and I paid.

868
01:23:27,602 --> 01:23:30,070
But the ball doesn't get dirty.

869
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:35,370
Scoring a goal
in front of 100,000 people,

870
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:38,343
like I did with the English,
for example,

871
01:23:38,947 --> 01:23:43,316
was for me a normal thing.

872
01:23:46,221 --> 01:23:49,122
It was my game, my life.

873
01:23:50,692 --> 01:23:51,750
You understand?

874
01:23:52,894 --> 01:23:54,725
When I came down,

875
01:23:56,197 --> 01:23:59,997
I was like everyone,
like all of you.

876
01:24:00,735 --> 01:24:02,327
And I could talk to you.

877
01:24:02,470 --> 01:24:05,530
What messed me up
was cocaine.

878
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:08,001
But I was just like you.

879
01:24:08,143 --> 01:24:12,204
However,
when you let the tiger out,

880
01:24:12,680 --> 01:24:15,410
when I went onto the pitch,

881
01:24:16,184 --> 01:24:18,152
I was in command.

882
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:03,294
The Goal of the Century

883
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:04,420
Emir,

884
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:08,727
do you know what a player
I'd have been if I hadrt taken coke?

885
01:25:11,639 --> 01:25:13,539
What a player we lost!

886
01:25:15,176 --> 01:25:17,269
It's like a bad aftertaste.

887
01:25:17,812 --> 01:25:20,679
I could have been
much more than I am.

888
01:25:24,085 --> 01:25:27,213
Yes, really, it's true.

889
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:32,084
I was born into football.

890
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:35,858
I knew who I was going to be.

891
01:25:36,197 --> 01:25:38,461
But I didn't know I'd take coke.

892
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:40,591
I knew I was going to buy
a house for my mother,

893
01:25:42,203 --> 01:25:46,799
to get married
and have my family,

894
01:25:46,941 --> 01:25:50,069
to see the world,
that Argentina would win the Cup.

895
01:25:50,211 --> 01:25:52,873
I said that when I was this big.

896
01:25:56,317 --> 01:25:57,750
It's on tape!

897
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:02,354
I knew all of that.

898
01:26:04,225 --> 01:26:06,352
But what happened afterwards...

899
01:26:06,494 --> 01:26:09,429
There are still so many things
that today

900
01:26:09,898 --> 01:26:15,803
I feel terribly guilty about inside.

901
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,763
Because...

902
01:26:20,208 --> 01:26:25,271
people might say that I'm fine,
or I'm better,

903
01:26:26,047 --> 01:26:29,710
or better than before.

904
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:32,950
But they're not inside me.

905
01:26:36,658 --> 01:26:38,387
I know the things I did wrong.

906
01:26:40,695 --> 01:26:42,026
And I can't right them.

907
01:26:42,497 --> 01:26:44,795
If I were Maradona

908
01:26:44,933 --> 01:26:46,764
I would live just like him

909
01:26:47,402 --> 01:26:49,734
If I were Maradona

910
01:26:49,871 --> 01:26:52,032
in front of any goal

911
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:54,671
If I were Maradona

912
01:26:54,809 --> 01:26:57,004
I would never
make a mistake

913
01:26:57,145 --> 01:26:59,375
If I were Maradona

914
01:26:59,514 --> 01:27:01,744
lost in any place

915
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:06,917
Life is a lottery
by night and by day

916
01:27:07,055 --> 01:27:11,287
Life is a lottery
keep going and going...

917
01:27:21,569 --> 01:27:23,901
If I were Maradona,

918
01:27:24,038 --> 01:27:26,006
I would live just like him

919
01:27:26,407 --> 01:27:28,637
A thousand fireworks,
a thousand friends

920
01:27:28,776 --> 01:27:31,244
And whatever happens
at 1000 percent

921
01:27:31,379 --> 01:27:33,506
If I were Maradona

922
01:27:33,648 --> 01:27:36,014
I'd go on Mondiovision

923
01:27:36,150 --> 01:27:40,780
To shout at the FIFA
that they're the real thieves!

924
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:45,256
Life is a lottery
by night and by day

925
01:27:45,727 --> 01:27:49,823
Life is a lottery
keep going and going...

926
01:28:18,760 --> 01:28:21,024
If I were Maradona

927
01:28:21,162 --> 01:28:22,891
I would live just like him

928
01:28:23,464 --> 01:28:25,728
Because the world is a ball

929
01:28:25,867 --> 01:28:28,028
lived raw under the skin

930
01:28:28,169 --> 01:28:30,433
If I were Maradona

931
01:28:30,571 --> 01:28:32,630
with a game to win

932
01:28:32,940 --> 01:28:35,135
If I were Maradona

933
01:28:35,276 --> 01:28:37,540
with a divine hand...
