罗伯特建议把飞机上的炸弹 留给日本人
Robert wanted to bomb the Japs right then and there.

而我认为更重要的是 将胶卷安全带回去

但罗伯特仍坚持，这我理解

It was a miracle to meet an English speaking girl in such a small village.

63
00:16:32,290 --> 00:16:37,120
就这样我被这群 陌生的中国人救活
So I was rescued by a group of Chinese soldier by the eighth rout army

64
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,990
开始了我第二次生命

65
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:42,650
我遇到的是一支 插向敌后的八路军部队
They had managed to penetrate deep into the Japanese territory.

当时四周全是日军

好像对我的出现很不满意

安小姐曾是北平城里 一所医科大学的学生

72
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,780
战争爆发后，她参加了军医

73
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,720
这次安排她参加护送 一是可以照护我的伤
Because the medical expertise and her English speaking skills

74
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,950
更重要的就是她会一点英语

我感谢上帝 给我派下来这个天使
It seemed that God had sent me an angel

00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:23,070
我作梦也没有想到 会这样来到了长城之上

在我们这儿 男人出远门的时候
In China, when men leave home

女人会给他们缝一个红肚兜

为的是保佑亲人一路平安的
As a good luck charm.

90
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:06,830
东方人不喜欢别人 问起家里的事，对吧
You Orients don't like it when people ask about your family, do you?

91
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:29,820
过了河就到了分区了
The division is right across the river.

92
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,420
刚才他说什么
What did he say?

93

经过三天的急行军

102
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,020
我们终于快要到目的地
We neared our destination,

00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:45,420
八路军的军分区了
Military command post of the eighth rout army.

104
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:49,720
三天中，走过了长城 翻过了太行

105
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:54,530
看到了一贫如洗的村庄 和建在半空中的宇宙
passed poverty stricken villages and temples built on cliffs

106
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,020
老乡

得离开这儿了
We have to go

113
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,970
也许他正带人来接我们呢
Maybe he is already on the way

114
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,400
已经过了约定的时间了
He is late

115
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,340
只要他还活着就一定能找到 部队
If he is alive he will find the base

116
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,410
但如果他被俘了呢
But what if he got caught?

117
00:27:04,550 --> 00:27:06,520
那他也不会说的，我了解他
He won't tell, I know him

118
00:27:06,890 --> 00:27:08,580
你知道鬼子的酷刑吗
Do you know how the Japs Torture the prisoners?

119
00:27:10,990 --> 00:27:13,220
我们藏在这里已经三天了
We have been in hiding for three days.

120
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:16,220
由于日军突然扫荡
And no villagers in the military base

121
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,760
军分区所在地的村庄 没有一个人活下来
had survived the attack of the Japanese

122
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,130
黑子派了一个战士 去寻找游击队
Darkie sent a soldier to search for the guerrilla

123
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:26,240
到今天也没有回来
And that soldier hadn't come back yet.

124
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:30,070
他很重要 还带着日军重要的情报胶卷
He's got important information on him

125
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:32,810
所以不能让他落在鬼子手里
We can not let the Japs get to him

126
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:38,320
欧文先生 明天我们就要离开这儿了

本来我们的任务 是把你送到这儿来
Our mission was to get you here.

129
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,790
下面由分区派队伍送你过黄河

130
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:46,590
过黄河

00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:50,850
对，过了黄河就是根据地了
Yes, the base is right across the river

132
00:27:51,030 --> 00:27:52,590
是延安吗
Is it Yian-An?

133
00:27:53,030 --> 00:27:54,300
是的
Yes

134
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,690

可是现在只有我们 来送你过黄河了

OK，我会游泳，你呢

我可以带你游过去
I can help you swim across

138
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,880
游过去
Swim

139
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:11,380
黄河
The Yellow River.

140
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:14,150
为什么不能，我会划艇
Why not? I can row

141
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:18,150
黄河的浪会比 科罗拉多的浪大吗
The waves here cannot be bigger than those in Colorado.

142
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,220
到了你就知道
You'll see.

143
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,660
这是什么宝贝
What is this?

144
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:35,040
这么说我们明天就到延安吗
We will arrive in Yian-An tomorrow?

145
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,710
明天
Tomorrow

146
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:39,110
走山路顺利的话也要三天
We must hike for 3 days.

147
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:44,810
安琪儿，我有话要说 你们是好人
Angel, there is something I have to say you are good people

148
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:48,350
但不懂军事，要过黄河
But you know nothing about military. You want to cross the Yellow River.

149
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:52,790
应该走这条公路 一天就能到达
You have to go along the highway, that will only take a day.

150
00:28:54,330 --> 00:28:57,520
这是敌战区，不能走大路
This is occupied territory, we can not use the main roads.

151
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,600
我有重要的情报要送回去
I have important information for the base.

152
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:03,630
不能跟着你们
I cannot stick with you.

153
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:08,170
在山沟里钻来钻去
and walk around in the mountains.

154
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:10,500
不钻山沟，你还能飞过去
You mean you want to fly there?

155
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,010
你们不是真正的军人
You are not real soldiers.

156
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:18,850
在山沟里钻来钻去
You walk around in the mountains.

157
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:23,250
打不赢这场战

158
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:24,820
你说啥

162
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:03,250

00:31:47,530 --> 00:31:49,130
他说要走公路

164
00:31:50,970 --> 00:31:52,300
延着公路追
Chase them along the highway

165
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:09,880
安琪儿，黑子…

00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:32,740

走
Go

184
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,960
由于我的失误 我们失去了一个朋友
It was my fault that the soldier died.

185
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,630
这也使我知道
And I now understood

186
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,670
我与他们之间存在着 许多的不同
the differences between us.

187
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:48,300

00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:17,260
黑子决定带我们回他的家乡
Darkie decided to take us to his home town

00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:19,930
那里离黄河很近 他准备从那里渡河

希望你早日跟我们站在一起

三炮呀，你还在打光棍啊

明天老地方过河
We cross the river tomorrow as usual.

202
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:53,560
咱们这土头土脑的地方 哪里来的洋人啊
How can there be a foreigner here.

203
00:37:54,270 --> 00:37:55,830
装蒜

咱们的人要过黄河
We want to cross the Yellow River

00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,550
不…
No...

218
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:38,470
你这孩子怎不听话呢
You don't listen to me?

219
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:39,930
你这孩子怎不听话呢
You don't listen to me?

220
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:48,410
黑子，这是我的表
Darkie, this is my watch

221
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:52,440
送给她，你不可以管
I gave it to her, this is none of your business.

222
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:53,980
我是他爹
I am her father.

223
00:39:58,590 --> 00:40:00,060
那就谢谢洋大大

224

225
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:07,700
好了…不

226
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:12,030
早上爷爷叫你干啥来着
What did grandpa wanted you to do?

227
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:13,500
捉蠍子
He told me to get scorpions.

228
00:40:13,870 --> 00:40:15,200
捉蠍子干啥来着
Why?

229
00:40:15,370 --> 00:40:18,810
给洋大大治伤
For Foreign uncle's wounds.

230
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:21,470
治好伤干啥去
Why?

231
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:23,480
打鬼子
Fight the Japs.

232
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:46,660
那就不要送了
You don't have to see us off.

233
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:47,500
留步…
Please don't see us off...

234
00:40:47,670 --> 00:40:49,970
那就不要送了，下次再来
Please visit us again.

235
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:53,670
到我们温泉洗个澡 包治百病
We can take a bath in the hot spring, it is very healthy.

236
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,210
花花，干什么呢
Huahua, what are you doing?

237
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:06,710
捉蠍子
I am looking for scorpions.

238
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:08,510
捉蠍子干啥
Why?

239
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,020
治伤
To heal wounds

240
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:12,910
你爷爷伤了啊
Is your grandpa wounded?

241
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:21,530
我不告诉你
I am not telling you

242
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:40,750
吃…
Eat...

243
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,220
可好吃的
It is very tasty.

244
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:18,520
这些西方人认为 公鸡才吃的虫子
I once saw a rooster ate a scorpion

245
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:22,320
在中国人那里 却被当做神奇的药物
But in China people eat them as medicine.

246
00:43:22,860 --> 00:43:25,850
可是令人惊奇的是第二天 我的炎症就消除了
The next day, my inflammation was gone.

247
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:46,580
我们把衣服弄脏了 妈妈要打屁股了
We got dirty, your Mom will spank you.

248
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:50,880
怎么啦
What's wrong?

249
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:54,190
我妈妈死了
My Mom is dead.

250
00:44:03,870 --> 00:44:05,060
对不起
I'm sorry.

251
00:44:21,350 --> 00:44:23,220
后来我才知道
I learned later,

252
00:44:23,390 --> 00:44:26,480
三年前，日军到这里扫荡
That his home town was attacked by the Japanese three years earlier

253
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:29,920
为了实验一种 新的毒气弹的性能
To test the effectiveness of the newly invented gas bomb

254
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:34,830
就在村里随意抓了一百多人 关进一座紂里
More than a 100 villagers were captured and locked in a temple

255
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:38,770
花花的妈妈和哥哥也在里面
Among them were Huahua's mother and brother.

256
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:55,010
后来黑子找到了妻子的尸体
Shortly after, Darkie found his wife's body.

257
00:44:55,990 --> 00:44:58,010
从她身上取下了一件遗物
He removed her red under garment

258
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,880
带着它参加了八路军
And carried it with him as he rejoined the eighth rout army.

259
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:24,680
洋大大
Foreign uncle...

260
00:45:25,650 --> 00:45:30,090
我还去捉好多蠍子 等你回来吃
I will get more scorpions for you

261
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:13,900
黑子，三年不见 你还能在我面前得色了
Darkie, it has been three years now you grow cocky on me?

262
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:15,290
三炮
Sanpao

263
00:46:18,340 --> 00:46:23,830
黑子，乡里乡亲的 回来怎么不见一面就走了
Darkie, you want to leave without visiting me?

264
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:31,680
咱们的事单说，跟他们没关系 你放他们过去
What's between us stays between us, let them through

265
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:34,550
都带回去
Get them.

266
00:46:39,990 --> 00:46:42,090
一起走吧，小妞
Come with us, sweetie.

267
00:46:47,370 --> 00:46:48,920
二小姐
Miss, It's you

268
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,080
你探的什么信，说是去抓仇家
what kind of informer are you? You said you are going to bring me my foes,

269
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:10,290
抓出个洋人来不说 还抓出个女儿来
And you bring me a foreigner and my daughter?

270
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:17,020
这些年没了音信 原来你跟了八路
Haven't heard a word form you, now you are with the eighth rout?

271
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:19,120
谁打鬼子我就跟谁
I'll stay with whoever fights the Japs.

272
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,460
放着书不好好读
I wanted you to study

273
00:47:23,740 --> 00:47:25,130
跟着起什么哄
Not to make trouble

274
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,640
读书
Study?

275
00:47:27,510 --> 00:47:31,200
日子鬼子他们让我读书吗
You think that the Japs will let me study?

276
00:47:31,940 --> 00:47:34,740
那你也不能和我断了音信啊
That is no reason for not contacting me

277
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:36,140
我还是你爹
I am, after all, your father.

278
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:38,110
我不认投敌的人做父亲
The minute you teamed up with the enemy you no longer are my father.

279
00:47:38,850 --> 00:47:41,550
我没投敌 我没给日本人干过事
That is not right, I never worked for the Japanese.

280
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:43,650
你现在正在为鬼子干事
You are working for the Japs right now.

281
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,350
好了
OK

282
00:47:46,860 --> 00:47:48,380
你立刻放我走
Let us go this instance.

283
00:47:48,990 --> 00:47:52,790
或都把我交给鬼子去 讨个好价钱
Or you can turn me in to the Japs, get a handsome reward.

284
00:47:55,170 --> 00:47:59,870
二小姐，寨主是疼你呀
Miss, chief did it all for you.

285
00:48:00,170 --> 00:48:04,200
卢沟桥一开火 寨主就让俺到北平去接你
As soon as the war started, chief sent me to get you.

286
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,380
谁知道你早就没影儿了
But you were long gone.

287
00:48:07,780 --> 00:48:09,010
你说这些年
Do you know

288
00:48:09,180 --> 00:48:12,550
寨主费了多大心的心思 打听你的下落
Chief was looking for you everywhere

289
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:18,750
这下好了，二小姐回来了 大家也可以放心了
now you're home, we no longer have to worry.

290
00:48:20,790 --> 00:48:25,020
要不还是先请二小姐回去休息
Miss, would you like to take a rest first?

291
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:28,460
请吧，二小姐
This way please.

292
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:36,660
她这些年跟八路心都跑野了
She has gone wild with the eighth rout.

293
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:39,670
麻烦不在这儿，我的寨主
This is not the problem.

294
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:43,810
咱们抓住洋人的事情 日本人马上就会知道
The Japanese will know that we caught the foreigner in no time

295
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:48,250
昨天孙翻译递过话来 日本人一定要活口
the translator said that the Japanese wanted him alive.

296
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,310
说是要弄到洋人飞机上的 啥秘密
said that they want to know some secret of the guy's plane.

297
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:56,390
这会儿二小姐 也辈在这个事情里头
Now that miss is involved.

298
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:58,390
这私通八路的罪
ganging up with the eighth rout is a crime.

299
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,960
要是把洋人交给日本人
but if we turn the foreigner in...

300
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:07,930
可落个汉奸的恶名
Than we become traitors

301
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:10,840
你没忘记三年前的事吧
You still remember what happened 3 years ago?

302
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:15,780
日本人可是敢灭了 咱们全寨人的命
The Japanese will wipe us out with little hesitation

303
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:25,920
真没想到，咱俩儿还是同乡
I never thought that we came from the same neighborhood.

304
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:28,480
没啥儿光采的
There is nothing be bragging about.

305
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:33,330
你父亲会把咱们儿 交给鬼子吗
Will you father turn us in?

306
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:40,800
安琪儿
Angel

307
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:44,710
我要去见日本人
I want to see the Japanese

308
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:45,670
什么
What?

309
00:49:45,840 --> 00:49:47,640
我去投降
I will surrender

310
00:49:47,850 --> 00:49:51,110
这一切事情都是我引起的
I caused all these

311
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,480
你们都是好人 为我去死我会很不安
You are good people, I don't want you to die for me.

312
00:49:55,650 --> 00:49:58,210
现在已经没有希望了
It is hopeless now.

313
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:02,560
我，你，还有你
Me, you and you

314
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:07,090
都已经尽了一个军人 最大的职责
Have all fulfilled the duty of a soldier.

315
00:50:07,270 --> 00:50:09,170
我们的武器也没有了
We lost our weapon.

316
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:13,890
可以无愧的停止抵抗
We can stop fighting with a clear conscience.

317
00:50:15,810 --> 00:50:21,370
按照日内瓦公约 受到战俘的待遇
And be treated according to the Geneva convention as a POW.

318
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:22,950
你个孬种
You whimp!

319
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,610
做为一个失去武器的美国军人
I am an US soldier without weapon.

320
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:29,620
可以选择光荣的投降
I can choose to surrender.

321
00:50:29,890 --> 00:50:31,820
日本人要抓的是我
The Japanese are after me.

322
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:34,520
你们因此有可能得到自由啊
You can all go free.

323
00:50:34,760 --> 00:50:36,690
日本人有你想的那么公道吗
You think you can reason with the Japanese?

324
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:39,320
你可是亲眼看见 他们是怎么对待老百姓的
You saw what they did to the villagers

325
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:40,760
我不是老百姓
I am not a villager

326
00:50:42,100 --> 00:50:43,190
我是军人
I am a soldier.

327
00:50:43,370 --> 00:50:44,600
我也是军人
I am a soldier, too.

328
00:50:46,340 --> 00:50:48,030
我要把你送到根据地去
I have to get you to the military base.

329
00:50:48,370 --> 00:50:49,860
这是给我的军令
These are my orders.

330
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:55,170
在没有接到新的命令之前 我就不许你去投降
Till I get any further instruction, I forbid you to surrender

331
00:50:55,350 --> 00:50:56,750
欧文先生
Mr. Owen

332
00:50:57,150 --> 00:50:59,780
我知道你们把生命 看得高于一切
I know that you think life is the most valuable thing on earth

333
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:03,080
并不把尽职后的投降看做耻辱
and don't think surrender after doing your job is a disgrace.

334
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,050
但在我们这里
But we,

335
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:09,350
宁可失去生命 也不能失去军人的尊严
we will rather die than to live in shame.

336
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:14,620
只要还有一个子弹 我也不会停止抵抗
Even if there is only one bullet left, I will not stop fighting.

337
00:51:14,930 --> 00:51:19,030
可现在我们不能无谓的 失去生命
But will can not lose our lives in vain

338
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:20,400
生命
Iife

339
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:22,670
只有你的生命是生命吗
You think only your life is precious?

340
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:27,140
你以为我们的人就可以白…
You think that we shall...

341
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:29,600
白白的为你送死吗
give up our lives for yours?

342
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,220
放开他
Let go of him

343
00:51:40,960 --> 00:51:42,450
不要打
Stop fighting

344
00:51:58,910 --> 00:52:00,400
二小姐
Miss

345
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:08,840
你难得回来
Since you are back

346
00:52:09,550 --> 00:52:13,050
明儿去你娘坟上加把土吧
You can go and visit your mother's grave tomorrow.

347
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:21,920
你先歇吧，有啥儿事明儿再说
You take a rest, we'll talk tomorrow.

348
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:24,760
让我住这儿，你就不怕我跑了
Don't you worry that I will run away?

349
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:31,000
既然回来了 当然应该住自己的房
You should stay in your own room.

350
00:52:32,110 --> 00:52:34,910
这些年我一直不让人动这儿
I never let anyone but you come in here

351
00:52:39,220 --> 00:52:43,680
既然回来，干啥儿还走
You are home, don't ever say about leaving.

352
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:47,920
放心 要跑我会跟他们一起跑的
don't worry, I won't leave without them

353
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:54,430
我有时想，应该再抱你一次
I often thought that I should hug you one more time.

354
00:52:55,800 --> 00:53:01,530
可一转眼，你已经大到 不能抱的个头儿了
But you are too old for that now.

355
00:53:07,950 --> 00:53:09,970
你真要把他们交给鬼子
You really want to turn them in to the Japs?

356
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:14,380
日本人这次动静很大 要抓那个洋人
The Japanese want the foreigner

357
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:19,020
我不能把╝鹤 引到咱们儿寨子里来
I have to take care of the whole village.

358
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:23,820
当年就是为了一个人 全寨搭进去30来口
We lost 30 people for just one man

359
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:29,360
至于黑子那是咱家的世代仇人
Darkie has been our foe for years

360
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:33,790
带我回牢子去
Put me back to the prison.

361
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:39,370
一个女娃儿和两个男人 住一块儿不是个样
A girl shouldn't be staying with two guys

362
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:42,640
我是军人，天天就这个样儿
I am a soldier, I do this everyday.

363
00:53:44,150 --> 00:53:45,550
穿这身衣服你是个兵
With uniform, you are a soldier,

364
00:53:46,220 --> 00:54:16,540
脱了这身衣服你还是我女儿
But without it, you are my daughter.

365
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:18,950
当初就不该送他去上洋学
I should never have sent her to school.

366
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:24,390
事已至此 只能是以后慢慢再调理她了
There is nothing to be done now, I will deal with her later.

367
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:27,680
头痛的事，那俩怎么了
What about those two?

368
00:54:28,430 --> 00:54:33,060
寨主，女儿是亲人，洋人是外人 黑子是仇人
She is your daughter, but those two have nothing to do with you.

369
00:54:33,700 --> 00:54:36,600
外人不值得用全塞的人命去换
We don't have to die for the outsider

370
00:54:36,900 --> 00:54:38,100
而仇人
And our foe...

371
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:41,200
黑子是咱安家的世仇
Darkie is our sworn enemy.

372
00:54:41,540 --> 00:54:45,030
是世界上有他没我 有我没有他
There can only be one of us.

373
00:54:45,210 --> 00:54:50,270
放心，这次他落在咱手里 我知道该怎么办
Don't worry, I know what to do

374
00:54:51,820 --> 00:54:53,180
只是洋人
But the foreigner...

375
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:56,850
明天孙翻译 要我陪着日本人去洗温泉
The translator, Mr. Sun want me to take the Japs to the hot spring tomorrow.

376
00:54:57,190 --> 00:54:58,550
你看能不能这样
How about this...

377
00:54:58,790 --> 00:55:00,520
你这先把黑子给结果了
You take care of Darkie

378
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:05,250
等到差不多的时候 再把洋人的事告诉日本人
And I wait till the time is right, tell the Japs about the foreigner.

379
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,660
等日本人来了，黑子已经死了
When the Japs arrive, Darkie will be dead.

380
00:55:08,870 --> 00:55:11,930
而洋人…
And the foreigner...

381
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:16,400
黑子啊
Darkie

382
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:24,280
是我啊，我来看你来啦
It's me, I come to visit you.

383
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:30,080
这些年我寻你寻的苦啦
I have been looking for you for so long

384
00:55:31,720 --> 00:55:35,850
黑子，你自个儿送上门来了
Darkie, and now you come to our doorstep.

385
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:42,070
有本事你放我出去 咱们儿一对一
Let me out, let do one-on-one.

386
00:55:42,530 --> 00:55:43,870
要你进来也行
Or you can come in.

387
00:55:44,040 --> 00:55:45,230
黑子
Darkie

388
00:55:46,040 --> 00:55:50,200
你们赵家害我失了男身 你还记得吗
You guy made me lose my masculinity, do you remember?

389
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:58,380
过去的仇家往后不能再打了 如今日本人…
That's in the past, but not the Japs...

390
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:00,110
少废话
Shut up

391
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:06,620
我已经熬了半辈子光棍了 能这么一笔就勾消吗
You forced me into celibacy, how can I forget that?

392
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:16,030
有报有还，老天开眼啊
Now it is you turn, there really is a God.

393
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:21,840
明儿个爷有公事 今天就在这儿给你送行
I am busy tomorrow, so I think I just drop by and say goodbye.

394
00:57:04,280 --> 00:57:10,450
妈妈…
Mother...

395
00:58:18,990 --> 00:58:19,980
闪开
Go away

396
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:08,560
我要见你们寨主
I want to see your Chief.

397
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:10,340
老爷他出去了
He is not here for the moment.

398
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:13,640
去哪儿了
Where did he go?

399
00:59:15,180 --> 00:59:17,580
那我们一块儿的两个人呢
How about the other two?

400
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:19,740
也带走了
He took them with him.

401
00:59:33,300 --> 00:59:38,030
自古欠钱还钱，欠命还命
You got to pay what you owe.

402
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:44,210
我们安家七条人命 你们赵家还欠一条
Your family took seven lives of ours, and now we take one of yours.

403
00:59:44,680 --> 00:59:46,440
今天请你补齐了吧
Today we will settle this.

404
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:49,770
咱们都快成了亡国奴了 俺真为你丢人
We are losing our country, and you are thinking about settling old debts?

405
00:59:50,180 --> 00:59:52,880
国难和家仇是两码儿事
These are two completely different matters.

406
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:58,380
你把美国人先放了 咱们的事情跟他关系
You let the American go this has nothing to do with him

407
00:59:58,820 --> 01:00:01,520
洋人的事就不用你管了
Don't worry about the American.

408
01:00:16,840 --> 01:00:18,870
小姐，你要的衣服
Miss, your clothes.

409
01:00:19,040 --> 01:00:22,070
你出去吧，把门关上 我要换衣服

太君，我们这是神泉 洗了以后保治百病

412
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:53,130
小姐

413
01:00:56,610 --> 01:00:58,210
小姐跑了
Miss is gone.

414
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:16,200
安琪儿
Angel

415
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:18,700
别担心
Don't worry

416
01:01:19,440 --> 01:01:21,000
他们不敢碰我
They won't touch me.

417
01:01:21,170 --> 01:01:22,330
去把她拉下来 是
Go get her down. yes, sir.

01:01:25,240 --> 01:01:25,900
谁都别动
Everybody freeze

420
01:01:26,080 --> 01:01:27,310
把他们解开
Untie them.

421
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,010
你想看我死在你面前吗
You want to see me die?

422
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:37,080
我数到三就拉
I count to three and then I'll pull.

423
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:39,080
一

424
01:01:40,560 --> 01:01:41,580
二

425
01:01:47,100 --> 01:01:48,160
把马牵来
get the horses.

426
01:01:48,330 --> 01:01:50,270
干得漂亮极了
Well done Angel, well done

427
01:01:58,140 --> 01:02:01,170
只要有人向我们开枪 或都追赶我们
If anyone shoots at us or chases us...

428
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:03,540
我就拉下这下它
I will pull.

429
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:07,780
本来是用来对付鬼子的
That was meant for the Japs.

430
01:02:08,020 --> 01:02:09,420
没想到
I never thought...

431
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:12,010
用在您这儿了
I will be using it under such circumstances.

432
01:02:25,040 --> 01:02:30,470
这手儿 只有我的女儿能玩出来
Only my daughter is able to do such a thing.

433
01:02:46,260 --> 01:02:50,850
孙翻译，你要的洋人 我给你抓住了
Mr. Sun, I got you your foreigner.

434
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:54,090
太君，太君
Mister...

435
01:03:17,590 --> 01:03:18,950
太君
Mister

436
01:04:26,620 --> 01:04:29,790
不过这下子日军已知道 我们的下落和我们的目的
By this time the Japanese knew our position and our goal.

437
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:32,890
把这一带的黄河渡口 全都封锁了
And they blocked all the crossing the to Yellow River.

438
01:04:33,730 --> 01:04:38,170
爷爷把我们 藏进了一座深山古庙
Grandfather hid us in an ancient temple deep in the mountain,

439
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,770
老和尚是他童年时的好友
Because the monk was a friend of his.

440
01:04:41,970 --> 01:04:45,530
安置好我们后 黑子就再次出去找游击队了
After he got us settled in, Darkie left to search for the guerrilla again.

441
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,780
我和安琪儿就先留了下来
Angel and I stayed at the temple.

442
01:04:48,750 --> 01:04:52,410
安琪儿带着我每天为老和尚 挑水，扫院子
Every day we carried water swept the yard for the old monk.

443
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:54,580
说这是他们的习惯
She said it was their custom.

444
01:05:14,270 --> 01:05:17,970
战争似乎已经离我们 很遥远了
Within the walls of the temple, the war seemed far away.

445
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:25,610
在小岛，松林 和东方文化的神秘气息中
I was lost in the mysterious ambiance of the Oriental culture. The birds and the evergreen were our companions.

446
01:05:25,780 --> 01:05:31,150
这里成为了 我和安琪儿的伊甸园
Angel and I had our own little paradise

447
01:05:43,870 --> 01:05:47,330
我惊叹东方文化的古老和灿烂
Angel told me much of the long standing oriental culture

448
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:51,130
安琪儿给我讲了许多 里边的故事
Her stories of illusion

449
01:05:51,340 --> 01:05:54,780
有幻想，浪漫还有爱情
of romance, war and love were magnificent.

450
01:05:56,250 --> 01:05:59,080
爷爷和花花常来看望我们
Grandpa and Huahua visited me often.

451
01:05:59,450 --> 01:06:01,780
每次来都是我们的一次节日
Every visit was like a holiday.

452
01:06:03,350 --> 01:06:08,380
爷爷说万一没有别的办法 就用这些东西游过去
Granap said we could cross the river by carrying calabashes.

453
01:06:08,560 --> 01:06:10,580
他知道一个可以游过去的地方
He knew a spot where we can swim across

454
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:14,160
中国人很聪明
He was true China man, extremely wise.

455
01:06:14,570 --> 01:06:18,660
他们总是能想出各种 奇妙的方法去解决问题
They have ways finding ingenious solutions to their problems.

456
01:06:20,370 --> 01:06:24,330
安琪儿，我的肚子累了
Angel, I am tired.

457
01:06:24,510 --> 01:06:29,100
饿，你说我饿了，不是累了
You mean that you are hunger

458
01:06:34,220 --> 01:06:37,120
花花的蝎子 不但完全治好我的伤口
The scorpions not only healed my wounds

459
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:41,050
也使我变成了一只 爱吃虫子的公鸡
but also turned me into a rooster that loved to eat insects.

460
01:06:55,910 --> 01:06:57,370
开飞机
Fly an airplane.

461
01:06:57,540 --> 01:06:59,200
开飞机
Fly an airplane.

462
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:01,280
去打鬼子
To fight the Japs.

463
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:02,740
去打鬼子
To fight the Japs.

464
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:05,350
我是中国人民的朋友
I am a friend of the Chinese people.

465
01:07:05,520 --> 01:07:06,070
我是中国…
I am a friend...

466
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:07,650
人民的… 人民的…
of the Chinese... of the Chinese.

467
01:07:07,820 --> 01:07:09,510
朋友 朋友
People People

468
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:11,620
对 我是安琪儿的朋友

469
01:07:13,260 --> 01:07:19,920
我是安琪儿的 最，最，最好的朋友
I am Angel's best friend.

470
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:32,140
是的
Yes.

471
01:07:33,640 --> 01:07:38,340
做为军人，你们很勇敢 但有时，你们不珍惜生命
You are brave soldiers, but you don't value life

472
01:07:38,750 --> 01:07:43,050
比如那天我和黑子打架 你们对投降…
Like the other day, I fought with Darkie...

473
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:53,120
而战争总会过去 活下去也是一种胜利
This war will end sooner or later Being alive is a victory.

474
01:07:53,700 --> 01:07:57,360
所以我们有很多不同 风俗，观点什么的
We are very different.

475
01:07:57,800 --> 01:08:01,100
但是，有一点相同
But we do have one thing in common.

476
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:04,800
都有爱
We have love.

477
01:08:05,540 --> 01:08:09,500
爷爷，花花，黑子，还有你
Grandpa, Huahua, Darkie, and you

478
01:08:09,780 --> 01:08:14,510
我看到你们的心里 都有许多的爱
I can see you all have a lot of love.

479
01:08:21,930 --> 01:08:23,290
那就是黄河
That is the Yellow River.

480
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:27,060
是我们要去的地方
That is where we want to go.

481
01:08:28,030 --> 01:08:29,400
美极了
It's beautiful.

482
01:08:32,270 --> 01:08:35,570
安琪儿，我很久 就有个问题想问你
Angel, there is something I want to ask you

483
01:08:36,170 --> 01:08:38,540
你为什么总把手榴弹
Why do you always...

484
01:08:40,280 --> 01:08:42,800
捆在身上
have a grenade by you side?

485
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,290
对不起
Sorry

486
01:08:57,190 --> 01:08:58,920
也许我不该问的
Maybe I shouldn't ask

487
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:02,060
没什么
Nothing

488
01:09:20,820 --> 01:09:23,980
三炮啊，有啥儿信吗
Sanpao, any messages?

489
01:09:35,070 --> 01:09:37,330
今天算我栽在你手里了
You win

490
01:09:37,740 --> 01:09:39,000
是天数
It's destiny

491
01:09:41,010 --> 01:09:45,410
只请你看在和我女儿 在一个营盘里共命的份上
My daughter worked with you

492
01:09:46,210 --> 01:09:47,730
放过她的命
Please spare her

493
01:09:57,350 --> 01:10:00,920
好，有种，是条汉子
Good, that's what a real man is

494
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:04,160
咱们俩一对一
It's one-on-one

495
01:10:11,940 --> 01:10:15,930
咱俩家过去的仇 再杀多少年也到不了头
We are never able to settle the debt between our families

496
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:21,500
现在，咱们在队伍了 凡事都讲个理
But now we have to act reasonably

497
01:10:22,550 --> 01:10:26,210
今儿个来，就是给你说个理的
I want to reason with you today

498
01:10:28,450 --> 01:10:29,580
你说吧
Go ahead

499
01:10:29,750 --> 01:10:32,920
就一句，你我都是中国人
We are both Chinese

500
01:10:35,260 --> 01:10:37,590
鬼子杀了多少咱们多少老百姓
The Japs have killed so many Chinese

501
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,560
可人家大老远来 豁出命帮咱们打鬼子
He came all the way to help us fight the Japs

502
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,930
咱们还这么对待人家
And this is how we repay him?

503
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:49,000
你是江湖上闯了一辈子的 知道做人是最该讲个义字
You should know, we must do the right thing

504
01:10:50,040 --> 01:10:51,670
人活一口气
That is what we live for

505
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:55,010
咱们无论怎样 都不能丢了中国人这个义字
We can not give the Chinese a bad name

506
01:10:58,680 --> 01:11:03,120
再就是，我想告诉你 你女儿的事…
And I want to tell you about your daughter

507
01:11:06,820 --> 01:11:08,520
不必
That's not necessary

508
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:13,960
你接着说
You go ahead

509
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:18,670
我俩在一个部队上 她的事知道一点儿
We are both is the army, I know a few things about her

510
01:11:19,070 --> 01:11:24,740
但我不知道她和我是同乡 只知道她是城里来的学生娃儿
But I don't know we came from the same neighborhood, only that she is a student from the city

511
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:35,050
你知道她身上 为啥总捆着一颗手榴弹吗
Do you know why she always carries a grenade?

512
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:43,520
我是一个战士
I am a warrior

513
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:46,960
也是一个女人
I am also a woman

514
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:49,690
每一分钟都可能遇到危险
I could get into trouble anytime

515
01:11:50,470 --> 01:11:54,160
会掉队，会被俘，会死亡
I could get lost, get caught or get killed

516
01:11:56,010 --> 01:11:58,470
在死亡和被俘之间 做选择的时候
If I have to choose between death and captured

517
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:03,710
我们女人只能选择死亡
We women can only choose death.

518
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:14,350
因为我知道日本鬼子…
Because I know that the Japs...

519
01:12:15,390 --> 01:12:17,490
是什么样的魔鬼
are devils.

520
01:13:10,150 --> 01:13:11,610
我终于明白了
I finally understood

521
01:13:11,780 --> 01:13:15,050
我面前的这个柔弱的中国女人 和她的同伴们
this dear Chinese girl standing in front of me

522
01:13:15,250 --> 01:13:18,280
为什么能在这样恶劣的条件下 仍与日本正规军队作战
The Japanese have forced her and her countrymen to live

523
01:13:18,490 --> 01:13:20,460
对入侵都的复仇
under terrible conditions

524
01:13:20,720 --> 01:13:23,920
使他们宁可将自己和死亡 永远捆在一起
The Chinese would rather die fight the Japanese

525
01:13:24,090 --> 01:13:26,690
宁可放弃生命 而不愿放弃人的尊严
than loose their dignity and live

526
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:57,120
你必须好好活下去
You have to stay alive

527
01:13:58,230 --> 01:14:04,430
任何时候都不要失去勇气
Never get discouraged.

528
01:14:07,870 --> 01:14:11,140
我们都会走过这个苦难的时代
We will get through the hardship.

529
01:14:12,910 --> 01:14:14,810
将来你还有孩子
You will have your own children in the future.

530
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:18,110
像你
They will be as...

531
01:14:19,080 --> 01:14:21,280
一样美
beautiful as you

532
01:14:55,290 --> 01:14:58,450
我们寨主 明天又有一批货要过河
We have another cargo crossing the river tomorrow

533
01:14:59,020 --> 01:15:00,890
还得请你多照应
Please take care of it

534
01:15:09,570 --> 01:15:11,500
明天老地方
Same place tomorrow

535
01:15:13,140 --> 01:15:19,740
满山的枣子火溜溜红
There are fruits all over the mountains

536
01:15:20,010 --> 01:15:27,110
妹妹那个缝衣孤零零…
Little sister is sewing along...

537
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:33,750
妹妹缝衣你莫要针扎了手
Watch out don't hurt your fingers

538
01:15:34,590 --> 01:15:41,460
哥哥我要舍你到那心头疼…
That will make me very sorry

539
01:15:51,410 --> 01:15:52,770
寨主
Chief...

540
01:15:55,650 --> 01:15:56,740
怎样
What?

541
01:15:56,910 --> 01:15:58,280
收了
Let's go

542
01:16:04,050 --> 01:16:09,960
您真的就这么把黑子给放了
You really let Darkie go?

543
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:26,500
十五的月亮，十六月
The moon is full

544
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:37,240
光棍棍的哥哥真后悔
I, being a bachelor, feeling very upset

545
01:16:57,910 --> 01:17:00,840
明天我送你们过河
I take you cross the river tomorrow

546
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:07,040
但…我女儿得留下来
But... please let my daughter stay

547
01:17:09,450 --> 01:17:13,360
该…给你成个家吧
It's time for you to get married

548
01:17:14,990 --> 01:17:17,550
我自己的事情用不着别人来管
That's my business

549
01:17:17,730 --> 01:17:21,160
就是黄河见了底，我也是你爹
Come what may, I am still your father

550
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:26,860
先生，她必须和我一起过河
Sir, she must go with me

551
01:17:30,170 --> 01:17:33,170
她，是我女儿
She is my daughter

552
01:17:33,340 --> 01:17:35,040
可是我爱她
But I love her

553
01:17:40,380 --> 01:17:43,350
先生，你没病吧
You are not sick, are you?

554
01:17:44,190 --> 01:17:44,950
我很清醒
I am sober

555
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,590
欧文先生
Mr. Owen

556
01:17:47,290 --> 01:17:50,320
我的事谁也不能代替我决定
I am the only one who can decide my future

557
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:59,130
明天，渡口见
see you at the dock tomorrow.

558
01:18:02,410 --> 01:18:03,930
日本人走了
The Japanese are gone.

559
01:18:06,110 --> 01:18:07,970
他给咱准备了船
He got us a boat.

560
01:18:10,350 --> 01:18:13,510
赵家和他安家十三代血仇
They are our sword enemies for 13 generations

561
01:18:16,690 --> 01:18:19,050
他会坑咱
He cannot be trusted.

562
01:18:24,160 --> 01:18:27,560
我感觉是谎话
I can feel that he is cheating.

563
01:18:27,730 --> 01:18:29,320
不吹的是葫芦
He must be cheating

564
01:18:36,940 --> 01:18:38,130
这是什么
What is this?

565
01:18:38,310 --> 01:18:39,430

不，这怎么是家呢，这是洞
No, this is just a cave

568
01:18:45,180 --> 01:18:47,310
家应该是…
Home should be...

01:18:50,620 --> 01:18:51,950
这是花花
This is Huahua

570

对，还要有花

572
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:01,220
安琪儿
Angel

573
01:19:02,030 --> 01:19:08,800
我想当我们回去后 你就不再回军队了
When we go back, don't go back to the army

574
01:19:11,370 --> 01:19:13,540
我带你飞回去
I will fly you back

575
01:19:15,710 --> 01:19:17,580
完成你的学业
You can finish your study.

576
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:19,550
医科大学
Medical collage

577
01:19:19,720 --> 01:19:22,380
对，我的服役期到了
right, and I will discharge from the army.

578
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:26,780
花
flowers

579
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:28,990
花很漂亮
Those flowers are beautiful.

580
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:31,960
这是我，像不像
This is me, does it look like me?

581
01:19:32,130 --> 01:19:34,320
像，还有阿姨呢
Yes, and there is antie

582
01:19:34,730 --> 01:19:37,220
对，还有阿姨
Right, and antie

583
01:19:37,430 --> 01:19:38,770
安琪儿
Angel

584
01:19:46,810 --> 01:19:48,940
我的同胞们还在作战
My people are still at war

585
01:19:49,550 --> 01:19:52,740
我理解，但你已经…
I understand, but you have already...

586
01:19:54,020 --> 01:19:59,110
在你的军队中服役五年了
served in the army for 5 years

587
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:01,980
服役期
Lag...

588
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:03,590
是的
Yes

589
01:20:04,830 --> 01:20:07,520
别人把刀架在你头上的时候
But when someone is holding a knife against your neck

590
01:20:09,170 --> 01:20:11,570
你就什么权利都没有了
You have no right

591
01:20:14,340 --> 01:20:16,170
送给你用吧
You take it

592
01:20:16,740 --> 01:20:23,340
但是…希望你早日 不再用这个东西
But I wish... you will never have to use it

593
01:20:35,690 --> 01:20:38,320
我会在你身边保护你
I will protect you

594
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:44,720
我不允许在你身边 有死亡的存在
I won't allow you be threatened by death

595
01:21:35,620 --> 01:21:36,810
你们听
Listen

596
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:41,020
黄河
It's the Yellow River

597
01:22:03,850 --> 01:22:06,540
虽然安琪儿 给我讲过那么多次黄河
Angel talked a lot about the Yellow River

598
01:22:06,720 --> 01:22:09,780
但当我真站在它面前的时候
Only then, as I stood on it's banks

599
01:22:09,950 --> 01:22:13,220
仍被一种前所未有的震撼力 给征服了
did I understand its overwhelming strength and power

600
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:17,150
只有在这里，我才真正明白了
Only by standing by her, can one understand

601
01:22:17,330 --> 01:22:20,130
为什么它被称做 中国人的母亲河
why they call it the mother river of China

602
01:22:20,500 --> 01:22:24,330
为什么它是中国人 民族精神的象征
It is truly a symbol of the spirit of that nation

603
01:22:26,170 --> 01:22:29,000
过了河，就快到家了
We are almost home

604
01:22:30,310 --> 01:22:31,540
到家了
Home

605
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:33,970
过了这个山头，就是渡口了
When you cross the mountain, you will get to the dock

606
01:22:34,580 --> 01:22:35,980
你还有胶卷吗
Is there any film left?

607
01:22:36,150 --> 01:22:37,340
还有一张
One last photo

608
01:22:37,950 --> 01:22:39,680
我想在这儿拍张照片
I would like to take a picture here

609
01:22:39,850 --> 01:22:41,180
我很愿意
It's my pleasure

610
01:22:41,350 --> 01:22:42,840
你能把照片给我吗
Can you give me the picture?

611
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:44,250

I will give you all your pictures

613
01:22:50,990 --> 01:22:52,020
一定哦
That's a promise

614
01:22:53,060 --> 01:22:54,590
一定
A promise

615
01:23:43,180 --> 01:23:44,410
安琪儿
Angel

616
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:49,640
我爱你
I love you

617
01:24:47,310 --> 01:24:48,500
都准备好了吗
Ready?

618
01:24:48,780 --> 01:24:50,040
你就放心吧
Don't worry

619
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:51,770
船工呢
Where are the rowers?

625
01:25:51,740 --> 01:25:55,580
只要你女儿交出飞行员 我们保证既往不咎
We only want your daughter to turn the pilot in

626
01:25:55,750 --> 01:26:04,240
事已至此，我也只能替我女儿 表示对你们的一点心意了
This I did for my daughter

627
01:26:39,460 --> 01:26:42,450
兄弟，外面风大别吹着你了
Take care, it's cold outside.

628
01:27:47,860 --> 01:27:54,290
红樱樱大马你肕上走
Get on your horses

629
01:27:54,730 --> 01:28:02,000
妹妹送你到村头
Sister see you off

630
01:28:02,170 --> 01:28:09,300
三年五载你要回家转
Please come back

631
01:28:09,510 --> 01:28:16,040

明天回家看亲亲
Tomorrow I will be home

635
01:28:44,280 --> 01:28:53,210
掀起妹妹的红盖头
To see my sweet heart

01:29:04,500 --> 01:29:05,690
走
Let's go

637
01:29:12,880 --> 01:29:13,670
去哪儿
Where to?

638
01:29:13,840 --> 01:29:16,540
回野狼滩，我怕出叉 叫爷爷在那儿等我们
Back to the wolf beach, I told grandpa to wait for us there

639
01:29:59,820 --> 01:30:01,480
爷爷
Grandpa

640
01:30:04,090 --> 01:30:05,420
爷爷
Grandpa

641
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:09,890
爷爷
Grandpa

你俩快系上葫芦过河，我挡着

644
01:30:39,630 --> 01:30:42,720
黑子，别再跟我耍花招了
Darkie, don't play games with me.

645

老子早就盯上你们家老头啦
I have been watching your old man for quite some time.

646
01:30:46,100 --> 01:30:48,570
有种的你出来，咱们刺刀上见
Come out like a man and fight.

647
01:30:49,010 --> 01:30:52,440
黑子，咱们乡里乡亲的 把话说在头里
Darkie, let's get things straight.

648
01:30:52,710 --> 01:30:56,510
只要把洋人交出来 日本人就答应放你俩走
Give us the American, the Japanese will let you go

649
01:30:58,450 --> 01:31:00,970
快拉他过河，再晚就来不及了
Get him across the river before it's too late.

650
01:31:01,150 --> 01:31:02,120
那你呢
What about you?

651
01:31:02,290 --> 01:31:04,250
我水性好，慢慢能游过去
I can swim across.

652
01:31:10,830 --> 01:31:12,230
我不会游泳
I can't swim.

653

鬼子要交出洋大大
Japs want the foreign uncle

662
01:32:03,180 --> 01:32:08,050
黑子，咱们都是中国人 犯得着为个洋人受罪吗
Darkie, we are both Chinese, why get into trouble for an American?

663
01:32:08,220 --> 01:32:11,380
你也配是中国人
You don't deserve to be called a Chinese.

664

668
01:32:40,520 --> 01:32:42,880
知道

669
01:32:46,720 --> 01:32:48,190

站住

684
01:34:13,040 --> 01:34:14,300

我…过不了河了
I... can't

01:35:06,030 --> 01:35:07,500
把枪和东西都留下
Leave the gun and your stuff

692
01:35:12,570 --> 01:35:14,060
你们快下河
Quick, go into the water

693
01:35:14,470 --> 01:35:15,940
胶卷你带着

698
01:35:42,900 --> 01:35:45,420

我们永远在一起
We will be together forever

700
01:37:33,980 --> 01:37:35,600
潜下去…
Down...

701
01:37:36,810 --> 01:37:37,900
安琪儿
Angel

702
01:38:02,170 --> 01:38:03,260
我很疼
It hurts so much

703
01:38:04,940 --> 01:38:06,370
打到我背上了
they hit my back

704
01:38:06,540 --> 01:38:09,480
抓紧我，坚持住 我们一定能过河
Hang on tight, we are going to cross this river

705
01:38:27,730 --> 01:38:32,030
过了河…就要…到家了
When we cross the river, we can go home

706
01:38:37,740 --> 01:38:39,730
快啊，到家了
Come on, we are almost home.

707
01:38:44,050 --> 01:38:45,450
我们的家…
Our home...

708
01:38:48,580 --> 01:38:50,140
我们的家…
Our home

709
01:38:54,220 --> 01:38:57,890
我们的家…
Our home

710
01:39:18,950 --> 01:39:32,320
安琪儿…
Angel...

711
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:42,600
她放弃了自己的生命 把生命留给了我们
My angel gave her life for us

712
01:39:42,770 --> 01:39:46,040
她没有把自己的身体 留魔鬼面前
rather than surrender her pure body to the enemy

713
01:39:46,210 --> 01:39:48,540
而是把身体还给了母亲河
She gave her self to the mother river

714
01:39:49,350 --> 01:39:52,680
从她来到我面前的第一分钟起 我就已经感觉到了
I guess I knew it from the first time I laid eyes on her

715
01:39:53,150 --> 01:39:57,450
她是上帝身边 最美丽的一个天使
She was the most beautiful thing that I have ever seen

716
01:39:58,420 --> 01:40:02,360
我的安琪儿
An Angel

717
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:09,900
她引导我走出死亡
She delivered me from the darkness of death

718
01:40:10,930 --> 01:40:14,600
也将引导我走向光明
And guided me into the light of life.

719
01:40:54,010 --> 01:40:55,840
花花呢
Huahua, what about her?

720
01:40:57,210 --> 01:40:59,700
到延安后我就回成都了
Afterwards, I was returned to Chiando

721
01:41:00,080 --> 01:41:03,020
五十多年了 我不知道她在哪里
It's been over 50 years now

722
01:41:03,190 --> 01:41:04,380
因为我只知道她叫花花
All I remember is she was called Huahua

723
01:41:05,050 --> 01:41:08,460
但是我知道只要她还活着 就不会忘记这条河
But I know as long as she is alive, she will remember this river

724
01:41:08,620 --> 01:41:11,750
这河里有她祖先的灵魂 还有…爱
Because it has love

725
01:43:03,410 --> 01:43:04,930
能把照片给我吗
Can you give me the picture?

726
01:43:07,480 --> 01:43:09,310
一定
It's a deal.
