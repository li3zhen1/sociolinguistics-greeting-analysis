1
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,010
故事发生在凌家沟
This is the valley of Ling...

2
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:28,060
1937年初夏
as it was in the early summer of 1937.

3
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:31,280
凌家沟里世世代代住的都是农民
The people who lived here were farmers.

4
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:35,920
他们听说 在山的另一头还有另外一个不同的世界
They'd heard there was a world beyond, the hills that bounded their little valley...

5
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:40,000
但是从来没有人翻过山去看一下
... but as yet, no one had climbed those hills to see for himself.

6
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,160
这可能是因为他们比大多人都要知足的原因吧
Perhaps it is because they were more fortunate than most.

7
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,110
这里物产富饶 人们衣食无忧
The land was rich, and their bellies were full.

8
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:51,410
在这片土地上 生活着凌谭一家
On this farm, lived Ling Tan and his family.

9
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,950
他们是村里最幸福的一家人
And they were among the most fortunate.

10
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,810
既不是太富有 也不是太穷
They were neither too wealthy, nor too poor.

11
00:01:56,990 --> 00:02:01,360
乡邻们都很敬重他们
And they were greatly respected in the nearby village.

12
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:05,060
他们住在一个大宅子里
They owned a strong house...

13
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:08,890
世世代代都在同一片土地上耕耘
... and tilled the soil that belonged to their ancestors.

14
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:12,930
凌家人天性善良又有点坏脑筋 聪明又有点愚昧
They were both good and bad, both wise and foolish...

15
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:16,100
大多数时候浑身散发着这些农民气息
... and sometimes all these things at the same moment.

16
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:21,340
因此 他们家跟其他农民家庭相比几乎没什么两样
And therefore, they were very much like such families in any other land.

17
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:29,780
又到了每年播种的时候了
It was time for the rice seedlings to be planted...

18
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:32,950
此时 凌谭心里只惦记着一件事
... and Ling Tan was eager for but one thing:

19
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,390
那就是在天黑前
To finish as much of the work as could be done...

20
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,990
早点把活干完
... before the sun was gone from the sky.

21
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,760
虽然老凌家的大儿子和二儿子也在帮忙着许多活儿
But Ling's first and second sons were eager for many other things as well.

22
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:45,260
但是至少他们都还年轻力壮
For they were young.

23
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,100
喂!
Hey!

24
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:49,670
- 是你娘在喊我吗 - 是的 爹
- Is that your mother? - Yes, my father.

25
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,170
快过来 老头子 我有话跟你说
Come, old man. I want to speak to you.

26
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:54,740
太阳下山后 有的是时间听女人唠叨
Time enough to speak with women when the sun is gone.

27
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,110
我知道你听到了 你个老不死的
I know you hear me, you old turnip.

28
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,550
你俩兄弟别停下 接着把活儿干完啊
You two do not stop for anything until the field is done.

29
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,240
放心吧 爹
Ease your heart about that, Father.

30
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,560
啥事 老太婆 啥事这么着急
What is it, old woman? What is it?

31
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,400
你聋了吗 我要像牛叫一样你才听得到吗
You grow deaf? Must I bawl like an ox to make you hear?

32
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,730
地里还有活儿没干完呢 你把我叫回来做啥
There is work and you call me from the fields.

33
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,930
来 来 来
Come. Come.

34
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,170
你就别太辛苦了 还有儿子们呢
You work too hard and too long. You have sons to labor for you.

35
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,370
瞎说啥呢 我还干得动
What nonsense is this? I'm not yet so feeble.

36
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:35,680
你早就不年轻了 你要多休息
You're no longer young and you must not strain.

37
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:38,510
休息啥  我现在不是还年轻呢
I do not strain myself. I'm as much a man as I ever was.

38
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:41,350
来来来  洗洗你的脏脚
Come now. Wash your legs.

39
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:45,360
看这泥巴地 都把你这把老骨头累的不成样子了
The very weight of the mud can tire a man of your great age.

40
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:50,260
说起来 我们是时候该给家里添多个儿媳妇了
Well, perhaps a younger wife with a softer will might be added to a man's household.

41
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:52,460
别光说不练啊 老头子
Bring her on, old man.

42
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,070
那也得该找个人说说媒啊
I shall have someone to help me with my work.

43
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,540
估计还没说上媒 你就去见阎王爷了
And you shall be in your grave before your time.

44
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,140
瞎说八道 我会等到那一天的 不信你等着瞧
I think I would survive. I may try it to see.

45
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,370
还记得你右耳朵后面的牙印吗 老不死的
What of those teeth marks behind your right ear, old turnip?

46
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,310
哪能忘啊 很久以前被一只母老虎咬的
A hill tiger bit me. It was a long time ago.

47
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,710
是啊是啊 我就是那只母老虎
I was the hill tiger.

48
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:12,750
要怪就只能怪当初 有人把我当成了家猫
You made the mistake of treating me like a tame house cat.

49
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,510
小心我再咬你一次
It could happen again.

50
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:17,890
我可是一朝被虎咬 十年怕老婆啊
Not so long as the scars remain to remind me.

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,960
过来 跟我在这里坐会儿行不
Is it not good with me here?

52
00:04:21,130 --> 00:04:25,470
行 行 行 不过呢 勤劳的男人是不应该偷懒的
Yes, it is, but a man with his juices still in him should not so indulge himself.

53
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,200
- 我看我还是回地里干活去吧 - 没你在 地里的农活一样做得完
- I should go back to the fields. - The field will be finished without you.

54
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,510
来这边 闲着没事做的话 就帮我把鸭子拔拔毛好拿去市场卖
Here. If you must be useful, help me prepare these ducks for market.

55
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,870
拔鸭毛 那是你们娘们的事情
Ducks. That is woman's work.

56
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:40,710
老天要是给女人这多活儿干 那也得给女人找多几个帮手啊
If heaven sends a woman too much work, heaven will also send help to do it.

57
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,050
老太婆 你想得美啊 你以为老天会跟你想到一块啊
How is it, old woman, that heaven's will and yours are always the same?

58
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,990
山里草长得多好 牛吃得多肥啊
The grass is good in the hills and the ox grows fat.

59
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:03,400
你这是在说牛肥啊 还是说三弟肥啊
Which is the ox and which is our brother?

60
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,450
三弟是在做梦吗
Is our brother dreaming?

61
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,880
不是 他整天都是这脸傻样
No, that vacant look is his usual expression.

62
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,490
你俩真脏啊 是不是刚在泥里打完滚啊
You are very dirty. Have you been playing in the mud?

63
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:23,650
是啊 玩得开心着呢 你明天要不要一起来打滚啊
We have. It was very pleasant. Why do you not join us tomorrow?

64
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,050
你要求太多了吧
Oh, you ask too much.

65
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,790
哪里有活干 哪里准看不到老三
Where you find hard work, you will not find our brother.

66
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,900
大家都有活儿干好不好 只是有人用力气干活 有人用脑子干活
There is work for all. For those with strong backs and for those with strong minds.

67
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:34,160
脑子聪明 就不用干你们的粗活
If the mind is strong,the back need not bend.

68
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,600
而且也不用把脚弄脏
Nor need the feet get muddy.

69
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:43,080
他哪里聪明啊 一肚子驴脾气
He has no mind, only a temper.

70
00:05:49,090 --> 00:05:51,850
老二 这些日子你总是魂不守舍的 有啥烦心事啊
Brother, your mind is absent these days. Why is this?

71
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,890
我最近在想一些事情 都快烦死我了
I think, and my thoughts trouble me.

72
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:56,620
说出来 大哥给你想想办法
What is a brother for if not to share your troubles?

73
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:00,090
好吧 事情是这样的
Well, then, here is one of the things:

74
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,250
我发现 这个女人啊 跟我们男人很不一样啊
Women are not the same as we are.

75
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:04,590
老二啊 都结婚四个月 你才发现这个啊
Married four months and you just found this out?

76
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:07,330
还有还有呢 女人跟我们男人想的也不一样
But here is another thing: Women do not think as men do.

77
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,660
这女人哪里会想啊 她们脑袋里根本就想不出什么东西
Women should not think.They're not equal to it.

78
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,500
我觉得我家小玉就不一样
My wife Jade is equal to it.

79
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:13,670
你想太多了吧
You worry too much about that one of yours.

80
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,140
等以后她生了儿子 就会老老实实带孩子了
When she has a son, a son will be more important.

81
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:19,580
生儿子  我都结婚这么久了 都还没跟她洞房呢!
A son. I have not yet a wife... As I would have her.

82
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:22,580
她就像阵西北风一样 我一碰她 呼的一下就不见了
She is like a western wind. When I reach for her, she's gone.

83
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,720
西北风也可以驯服啊
Even western wind can be caught and tamed.

84
00:06:24,890 --> 00:06:27,360
我可不想驯服她 我想多理解她
I do not want her tame.Only, I do not understand her.

85
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,490
虽然她的人是我的 但是感觉她的心还不是
She is mine and yet she is not mine.

86
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:34,190
每次我一碰她 她整个人就像丢了魂似的
When I touch her, it is as if her spirit goes and only her body is left.

87
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:37,600
她长得又好看 又好闻 你还不满足啊
She is beautiful and sweet-smelling. Is that not enough?

88
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,560
不过我反倒是觉得是你的问题 我偷偷观察过
It is your fault. I've watched you.

89
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:42,200
当我们这些大老爷们坐一起抽烟的时候 你总是第一个走开
When the men sit and smoke, you're the first to leave.

90
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,640
我犯困了而已啊 我能有什么办法啊
Can I help it if the desire for sleep overcomes me?

91
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:49,270
老弟啊 这个女人的温柔乡 可是会把男人变成软蛋的啊
Do you not know that with a woman, eagerness passes for weakness?

92
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:53,070
- 你看 大老爷们坐一起时我总是最后一个走 - 你说的容易
- Sit with the old men until the last as I do.  - That is easy for you.

93
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,240
而且 我发现小玉不会老呆在一个地方
I've not found Jade in the same place twice.

94
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:57,480
也从来不等我睡觉
And never waiting for me.

95
00:06:57,650 --> 00:07:00,150
- 你觉得这就是问题的关键   - 是的
- Do you think that is the answer to the troubles?  - Yes.

96
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,160
天亮前我也碰不了她 天亮之后就更不用说
Then I will not go to her until dawn. And perhaps not even then.

97
00:07:04,330 --> 00:07:08,420
小玉 小兰 你们老公回来了
Jade, Orchid. The men of the house are at home.

98
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:12,130
这儿媳妇们都跑哪里去了啊
Now, where are the women my sons married?

99
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,430
小玉 小兰 原来你们在这里啊
Jade, Orchid. Oh, there you are.

100
00:07:15,610 --> 00:07:18,440
- 你家老公都回来了 去看看有什么需要帮忙的  - 好的 娘
- Your husband comes. Attend him.  - I go, Mother.

101
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,470
- 拿上我刚洗好的毛巾
- Take this clean towel I have made ready.

102
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:22,840
娘 我想跟你说说我的小女儿的事情
Mother, I must tell you about my youngest child.

103
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,780
小孙女 她怎么了
My grandchild? What about her?

104
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:29,820
她刚刚坐在那里 突然 张开了嘴 我在想...
She was lying there and all at once, she opened her mouth and I thought...

105
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,540
我在想 她是不是 要开口讲话了
I thought she was going to speak.

106
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,420
你啊 就是那些生过孩子
You are surely one of those who has given birth...

107
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:36,620
却还是满头死脑筋的人
...and remains in a daze at what you've done.

108
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:38,060
- 你老公等着呢 快去 - 好的
- Your husband waits. - Yes.

109
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,630
小玉啊
Jade.

110
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,290
小玉!
Jade.

111
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,340
看着点!
你们要才看着点!
Take care.
You take care.

112
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,380
真希望你把那烦人的笛子给没收了
I wish you would take that squealing thing from him.

113
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,050
你也是时候给他找个老婆 他也该给家里添丁了
You should get him a wife. It's time he brought grandsons into this house.

114
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:14,660
不着急 不着急
即使你让他去讨个老婆
In time. In time.
If you told him to marry...

115
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:16,490
他也不一定会听你的话
...you're not sure he would obey.

116
00:08:16,670 --> 00:08:20,530
- 所以你得帮他准备准备啊了  - 没那个必要吧
- So you spare yourself dealing with him. - There is no need to deal with him.

117
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,300
- 我还不清楚你心里想什么吗  - 你倒说说看
- Shall I tell you a secret thing in your heart? - No.

118
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:27,670
你最疼爱小儿子 但这事不好办
Our third son is the son you love best, but most uneasily.

119
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,070
他脾气跟老大老二不一样 你就怕这个
He's different from the others. You fear that.

120
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,540
所以你一直不敢给他找老婆
That's why you go on the far side of an argument.

121
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,050
儿子们要毛巾了
Our sons wait for their towels.

122
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,980
小玉 我的毛巾呢  小玉
Jade. Jade, where is my towel? Jade?

123
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:40,380
谢谢 小玉
Thank you, Jade.

124
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,420
小玉 我中午就没看见你老婆小玉了
I've not seen her since the sun was in the middle of the sky.

125
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,150
估计我们被媒人骗了
The matchmaker cheated us.

126
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:48,020
- 啥 我老婆不在家  - 我就没找到她人
- What? My wife is not in the house?  - I could not find her.

127
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:51,890
这女人家啊 要是不裹脚了 就像羊儿一样到处乱跑
This comes of women having their feet free. Nowadays they run around like goats.

128
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,230
- 要我帮忙吗 娘 - 你自个儿的活儿做完了
- May I help you, Mother? - Have you ever done so?

129
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,890
还是说 做了等于白做
Or has your worthless one?

130
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,560
家里那堆家务活 我刚都已经通通做完了
All that is done in this house, I do.

131
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:02,230
至少你们大嫂在家呆着的时候 小玉才有借口去村里玩
At least my wife stays at home. Jade has a reason to go to the village.

132
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:05,540
这男人要是一发话啊 女人就得随叫随到
When a woman knows a man wants her, she will ever display herself.

133
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,980
- 你说得对 - 你难道还没发现四表哥对小玉还余情未了吗
- That is true. - Have you not seen our fourth cousin look at Jade?

134
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,090
他就像只病猫一样盯着
He resembles a sick cat.

135
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,920
她要是我老婆 我准揍到她丑得没脸见人
I would beat her until she was not so good to look upon.

136
00:09:14,090 --> 00:09:17,220
这女人啊 越打越听话
If more of that were done, there will be less trouble with wives.

137
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,550
你们爷们可要有点真能耐才行
Only men should make sure first they are able.

138
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,990
现在的新女性可是打不得的
These new-fashioned women are not easily beaten.

139
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:26,100
我这就穿衣服去找她 让你们瞧瞧什么叫真能耐
I will dress and go find her.Then we will see who is able.

140
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,900
还是先吃饱饭吧 儿子 吃饱了才有能耐打老婆
Eat first, my son, and your arm will be stronger for all this beating.

141
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,200
谁躲在屋外偷看呢
Who tries to see within our house without himself being seen?

142
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,000
吃好了没有 三表婶
Are you eating, wife of my third cousin?

143
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:12,170
我们吃得不是那么好啊 你看看 连肉都没有
Our rice is poor and scanty.And we have no pork at all.

144
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:16,050
- 你要不要也一起吃点  - 不了 不了 谢谢
- But will you share it with us? - Thank you. But I cannot.

145
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:19,350
你一个人在家吗 四表哥在吗
Are you alone, then? Is my fourth cousin not here?

146
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,650
我儿子还没回来呢
My son is not home yet.

147
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:25,890
不过你三表伯在家
But your third cousin, my honored husband, is here.

148
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:29,500
你好 三表伯 你在书里又发现什么新东西了
How are you, sir? What new thing have you found in your book?

149
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:32,900
狗屁新东西 他读书都读到到家里揭不开锅了
Nothing his family can chew, swallow and grow fat on, I can tell you.

150
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,460
四表哥还在城里吗
My fourth cousin is in the city perhaps?

151
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:38,800
不知道 我儿子吃了午饭就不见了
I do not know. My son has been gone since the noon meal.

152
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:44,640
哦 那我先走了 我在村里还有点事
Well, I must get on. I have business in the village.

153
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:47,250
满口屁话
He lies.

154
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:50,480
都这个点了 村里能有啥事呢
He has no business in the village at this hour.

155
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,520
一定是找他们家老婆小玉去了
He looks for his wife, Jade.

156
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,320
要是他发现小玉和我儿子在一起 会不会....
And if he finds her with our son, as he well may...

157
00:10:56,490 --> 00:11:01,050
小玉早都嫁给老二了 而且我儿子早就死心了
Jade is married to Lao Er. The thing my son felt for her has ended.

158
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:04,960
除非他们凌家都死光了 不然这事没完
It will never be ended until one of them is dead.

159
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:09,000
说来说去都是你的错 老书呆子 都是你 害的我们吃不饱
You old book fool, it is your fault. It is your fault we starve.

160
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,160
都是因为你 我们家儿子才娶不到小玉
It is your fault we did not get Jade for our son.

161
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,640
- 这女人家的事与我何干啊  - 女人家
- Can I control a woman's choice? - A woman's choice?

162
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,410
难道不是因为你收了你表弟凌谭30个大洋
Did not your cousin Ling Tan give you 30 silver dollars?

163
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,980
难道不是你不让你家儿子娶小玉吗
Did you not tell our son he could not have the girl?

164
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,980
闭嘴 老婆子 我在看书呢
Quiet, woman. I read.

165
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:28,060
就是因为这样 老凌家一定会遭报应的
Out of all this, something terrible will happen.

166
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,620
我们是城里的大学生 今天...
We are students who have come from the university...

167
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,920
到这里是来告诉乡亲们
...to travel through the country and tell you and others like you...

168
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:36,290
北方发生战乱了
...news of the war in the North.

169
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:39,030
日本鬼子正向我们逼近
The Japanese march toward us.

170
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:42,000
这两张图告诉我们 日本鬼子侵略我们国家 还都在...
These are two pictures of what the Japanese are doing.

171
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,760
干些什么勾当
They are doing it now.

172
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,910
当你们坐在这里看的时候 这些悲剧正在别的地方发生
While you sit here and watch, these very things are happening.

173
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:48,810
老沈 看到我四表哥了没
Shen, have you seen my fourth cousin?

174
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,670
我们的同胞正惨遭杀戮 他们的尸骨正被无情掩埋
These are your people they are murdering and mine.

175
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,280
我们的国家正在被野蛮地侵略
This is our country they are looting.

176
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:57,390
敌人惨无人道 他们把我们当奴隶一样
The enemy is ruthless. He regards us only as slaves.

177
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,320
我们不能妥协 我们要学会反抗
We cannot deal with him. We must resist him.

178
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:03,010
- 不好意思 - 在找人么
- I'm sorry. - Seeking someone perhaps?

179
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:06,220
- 不是你边上的这位  - 我说 如果小玉是我老婆...
- Not the one who would sit near you.  - If she were my wife...

180
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,230
她要是离开你 我会替她高兴的
It is with pleasure that I leave you.

181
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:10,300
当日本鬼子来到你们的村子
When the Japanese reach your village...

182
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:14,100
他们会甜言蜜语欺骗你们 然后用双手沾满你们的鲜血
...they will come with lies in their mouths and death in their hands.

183
00:12:14,270 --> 00:12:17,570
你们必须反抗他们 宁死不屈
And you must resist them, even to your own deaths.

184
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:19,400
坚持到底
And beyond.

185
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,300
你们会这样做吗
Are you able to do this?

186
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:25,100
告诉我你们能做到 你们站起来告诉我 你们会这样做
Tell me you are. All of you rise and tell me you are able.

187
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:27,220
我们会
We are able.

188
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,180
看到没 难道只有一个人吗
See? There is one who speaks.

189
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,190
还有没有其他人吗 来 告诉我
Are there not others? Tell me. Come.

190
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,330
来吧 乡亲们
Yes. Come.

191
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,420
你去吧 我饿了
You come. I'm hungry.

192
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:45,060
女人就应该给家里的男人做饭
The woman should have food ready when her man is hungry.

193
00:12:45,230 --> 00:12:47,130
我老婆现在就老老实实呆在家里呢
My wife is at home where she should be.

194
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,940
难道我这是在对牛弹琴吗
Am I speaking into the wind?

195
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,340
你们难道对自己的所见所闻都无动于衷吗
Have you not understood what you have seen and heard?

196
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,810
我知道你们会起来反抗敌人的
I know you have. Tell me you will resist the enemy when he comes.

197
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,610
- 怎么反抗 小伙子 - 难道赤手空拳去跟机器打啊
- How then can we resist?  - Can we fight machines with our hands?

198
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:29,900
你为什么总是这样抛头露面 在大伙儿面前丢我的脸
Why do you shame me by showing yourself off to everybody?

199
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,410
我刚到家的时候 肚子都饿得咕咕叫了
I come home, my belly roaring like a hungry lion.

200
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,410
那你怎么不自个儿弄点吃的啊
Why did you not eat and silence it?

201
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:37,980
-你都不在家 我怎么吃得下 -我在爹娘面前一个人吃饭多不好
- How can I when you're not in your place? - I'm ashamed before my parents.

202
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,320
- 真希望你不会一个人上街 - 为什么
- I wish you'd not go in the street alone. - Why?

203
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,350
- 其他男人会看到你的 - 我又不看他们
- Other men will see you.  - I do not look.

204
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:44,790
我是不想让他们看到你而已!你可是我的老婆
I do not want them to look at you. You're my wife.

205
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:48,590
但是我不可能一直躲在院子里不出门吧 这又不是旧社会
But I cannot stay always in the courtyard.These are not ancient times.

206
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,160
我倒是希望这是旧社会 这样我就可以把你锁起来
I wish it were those times. I'd like to lock you up.

207
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,460
你要是把我锁起来 那我宁可饿死
If you lock me up,I wouldn't eat and then die.

208
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,860
我才舍不得让你饿死
I would not let you.

209
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,200
现在是新社会了 我想来就来 想走就走
But these are the new times, and I will come and go as I please.

210
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:00,600
- 真想扇你一巴掌 - 我又没做错事!
- I should beat you. - I have done nothing.

211
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:04,010
你不守妇道
But you are not where a woman should be at...

212
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:10,020
你就应该在家相夫教子
At home, waiting for her husband.

213
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,670
我还想问你一件事
And there is this thing.

214
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,640
在我们结婚前 那时候你还有的选择
Before we were wed, when the choice was put to you...

215
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:34,710
为什么选了我 而没有选四表哥
...why did you not choose me above my fourth cousin?

216
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,640
如果现在让你选 你还会选我吗
If you could choose now,which would it be?

217
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:43,720
你们两个都不缺胳膊少腿
You both have two arms and legs, and all your fingers and toes.

218
00:14:43,890 --> 00:14:46,220
也都不是瘌痢头 斗鸡眼
Neither of you are scabby-headed, nor cross-eyed.

219
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:49,450
- 选谁不都一样吗  - 你这话说的让我倒胃口
- What, then, is the difference between you? - You used me very ill.

220
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:55,220
不过你看起来又白又瘦 一副可怜巴巴的样子 活像贱骨头
You look so pale and so thin. You are so to be pitied, you big turnip.

221
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,260
我真希望我是个读书人
I wish I were a man of learning.

222
00:14:57,430 --> 00:15:01,960
这样我就可以把心里的想法告诉你 你也就能知道我的感觉了
I wish I knew the words to ease myself so I could tell you what I feel.

223
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,570
你能有什么感觉
What do you feel?

224
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,540
我对你有感觉 但是...
I know, but...

225
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,370
但是我说不出来具体是什么样的感觉
I do not have the words.

226
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:12,780
我也不是个读书人
I too am not very learned.

227
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:16,320
难道就是因为这个原因你才不跟我说话吗
Is that why you do not often speak to me?

228
00:15:16,490 --> 00:15:19,010
两个人只有多说话 才能相互理解
Two must speak for understanding.

229
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:24,060
如果我跟你诉说心中之事 你是否也愿意告诉我你的感受呢
If I tell you everything that is in me,will you tell me all that is in you?

230
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:30,590
愿意
那今晚我们一起聊聊
Yes.
Then tonight we will speak together?

231
00:15:30,770 --> 00:15:32,460
好的
Yes.

232
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,490
帮我把吃的拿过来 我要在院子里吃
Fetch me my food. I will eat here in the courtyard.

233
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:58,350
- 好的 老公 - 还有啊 今天你都没做饭
- Yes, my husband.  - And since you did not cook the meal...

234
00:15:58,530 --> 00:16:01,460
- 就帮忙打扫一下院子吧  - 好的 老公
- ...you may clean up after it. - Yes, my husband.

235
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,430
老二刚刚肯定揍她老婆了
He must have beaten her.

236
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,440
我可不是吹牛皮
I do not take too much credit to myself...

237
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,510
怎么说我也是村里唯一的读书人啊
...that I'm the only man in these parts who can read and write.

238
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,240
但是如果你不给我弄口饭吃
But how would I find time for my books if you did not send me rice...

239
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,210
多给点肉啊添几件衣服什么的 我哪有时间读书啊
...and a new coat now and then,and sometimes even meat?

240
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,250
你是个受人尊敬的文化人 老表
You are a scholar and my honored cousin.

241
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:25,110
你想安逸一点生活 这也是应该的
It is only proper that your needs and comforts be supplied.

242
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:27,220
我这地里收成也够我们大伙吃的
My land yields enough for all.

243
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,880
小兰 孙子该睡觉了
Orchid, it is time my grandson was in his bed.

244
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,150
- 知道了 娘 - 但是老表啊 你是否想过
- Yes, my mother. - But, cousin, have you ever thought of this:

245
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:35,800
过几年你也会入土为安
When your time comes to go into the earth yourself...

246
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,530
你是不是得提前帮儿子们分好家产啊
...shall you divide your land between your sons?

247
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:41,260
对的 我也想过这件事
Yes, I have thought of that.

248
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,370
你得开个好头 大哥
别坏了祖宗的老规矩
You have made a good beginning.
Do not spoil it.

249
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,930
家产够不够他们分啊
Will there still be enough for all?

250
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,770
还是说他们会因为吃不饱饭 而大打出手呢
Or will they quarrel because their bellies are not fully

251
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,380
老大 你来说说 告诉表叔
As my eldest son, you must answer our cousin.

252
00:16:53,550 --> 00:16:57,080
地里的收成够不够一家人吃饱肚子
Can this land feed three men and their wives and children after I am gone?

253
00:16:57,250 --> 00:17:01,690
可以啊 我少吃点肉 如果弟弟们愿意 我也跟他们和睦相处啊
It can. For I will eat less meat, if my brothers will, and leave in peace with them.

254
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:05,420
你看 我教会了我儿子们和睦共处之道 这样我也知足了
If I have taught my sons that peace is good, I am content.

255
00:17:06,330 --> 00:17:11,200
爹 如果你也跟我讲讲和睦之道的话 就不会这么早就知足了
If you had been with me today, you would not speak so easily of peace, my father.

256
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,370
你这么一说 要是我真的跟我儿媳妇讲道理的话
If it were proper for a man to speak to his daughter-in-law...

257
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,230
我倒是想问问 我们大老爷们讨论和睦之道有什么不妥呢
...l'd ask her why should not peaceful men speak of peace.

258
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:23,240
别怪小玉 爹 她是为今天茶馆里发生的事情而感到不安...
Forgive my wife, Father, for speaking so boldly, but today at the teahouse...

259
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:26,140
大学生们给村民们看了一些照片
...students came and showed the magic pictures and talked.

260
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:28,840
他们说北方战乱 东洋鬼子们
They told of the war in the North and how the dwarfs...

261
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:32,010
正对那里的人烧杀抢夺
...from the East Ocean islands burn cities and kill our people.

262
00:17:32,190 --> 00:17:33,850
如果儿媳妇还记得的话 我倒是想起来了
I wonder if my daughter remembers...

263
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:36,510
以前这些大学生还给我们看过虫子的照片呢
-...when other students brought the pictures of flies.

264
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:39,350
我记得 跟牛一样大的虫子
I remember.Flies as large as water buffalo.

265
00:17:39,530 --> 00:17:42,760
然后他们说 这些东西比老虎还可怕
Yes, and they told us they were more dangerous than tigers.

266
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,590
但是其实我们都知道
And everyone knows that our flies...

267
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,100
这些小虫子啊 根本没有什么危害
...are as small as a grain of rice and as harmless.

268
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:49,740
即使现在这些照片跟以往不一样 但是
And so does it not follow that today also perhaps...

269
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:53,740
学生们说的话实在是太夸张了
...both words and pictures were made
too large to be either truth or life?

270
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,640
我这么一说 是不是可以打消我儿媳妇的顾虑呢
Does that not quiet the woman's fear of my daughter?

271
00:17:58,810 --> 00:18:02,810
那是肯定的 快去睡觉吧 小玉
Of course it does.And it is time she was in her bed.

272
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:07,810
但是我们确实知道北方发生的那些杀人放火的事情
But we who are men know that there is killing and suffering in the North.

273
00:18:07,990 --> 00:18:10,290
你觉得战乱会牵扯到我们吗 爹
And do you not believe it will come here, Father?

274
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,620
我倒是觉得
I believe something else.

275
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,260
如果一个人安分守己
If a man lives his life in decency and as he should...

276
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:18,800
就算什么邪魔外道来了 也动不了他半根汗毛
...and then evil comes to him, it cannot harm him.

277
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:22,500
因为他总有办法可以扛过去 这就是我的生存之道
And he can conquer and overcome it. This, I live by.

278
00:18:22,670 --> 00:18:25,800
也是乡亲们的生存之道
And so I think do all the kinsmen in our village.

279
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,880
- 我们都是老实人 - 对对对
- We are men of peace. - True, true, true.

280
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:34,570
何况北方离这里远着呢 更不用说我的热炕头了 我也得赶紧上去睡觉了
Also, the North is a long way from here. And so is my bed, and I must get to it.

281
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:42,280
她估计心里还憋屈呢 你默数个五百下 等她消气了再去找她
She still is not cured. Wait 500 heartbeats. Then go to her.

282
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,120
我晚上刚出门的时候 月亮都照出我的影子呢
I will have my shadow to walk home with.

283
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:50,630
是啊 今天的月亮又大又圆的
Yes, the moon is round tonight and the color of a ripe peach.

284
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,790
我从书里读到说 地球也是圆的
I have read that the Earth, too, is round.

285
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:55,300
你上次跟我说过这件事情 不过我就纳闷
You have told me that but one thing troubles me.

286
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:59,930
既然这地球是圆的 那人怎么站在上面呢
How is it then if the world is round that men on the bottom side can walk?

287
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:01,870
那书上的事情都乱套了
Everything is opposite there.

288
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:05,340
小孩子一生出来是白头发 蓝眼睛
Children are born with white hair and blue eyes.

289
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,350
还有书都是反过来印 倒过来读的...
Scholars begin to the write from the wrong side of the page...

290
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,150
那些年轻娃子居然比老一辈还受欢迎
...and youth is admired instead of age.

291
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,950
按这样一来 他们要是走路头朝下 我也不觉得奇怪了
So why can we not believe they walk with their heads hanging down?

292
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,520
真笑死人了
And enjoy it too.

293
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,530
老太婆 你有没有想过 在这地的另外一边
Old woman, have you ever thought that somewhere very far below...

294
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:25,260
离我们这里十万八千里的地方
...the spot where we stand, our land goes on and on...

295
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:27,600
有个陌生人站在那里
...until at last a stranger stands on it?

296
00:19:27,770 --> 00:19:31,330
他也在那地里头 播种收割么
And plants seed and takes his harvest from it as though it were his own?

297
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:34,700
这地儿现在可是我们家的 还是我们儿子的
But it is not. It is ours. And our sons' after us.

298
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,070
是啊是啊 这地里的每一分每一寸都是我们的
Yes, the land is ours as deep as it goes beneath our feet.

299
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:42,240
我们头上的星星也是属于我们的 他们头上的才是他们的
And the stars above our heads belong to us, and whatever there is beyond them.

300
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,650
但是我还是觉得那地里的陌生人比较烦
But I'm troubled about that stranger on our land.

301
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:47,050
说不定他偷偷割我们的小麦呢
Somewhere he reaps his grain without telling you.

302
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,350
- 我觉得你应该收他的租 - 对哦 是应该收租
- You should ask him for rent. - That I would do.

303
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:53,590
我得跟他约法三章啊
I would have the law on him if I knew how to tell him so.

304
00:19:54,430 --> 00:19:58,560
嘿 别烦了 老二 打女人总会有好处的
Do not be troubled, my son.It is often good to beat a woman.

305
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,530
哦 哦 是的 娘
Oh, yes. Yes, my mother.

306
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,110
老头子 还有件事情我有点担心
Old man, there is something here and now that troubles me.

307
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,940
是关于小玉的
It is Jade.

308
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,680
小兰虽然有点傻 但是也听我的话
Orchid is stupid but she does what I tell her to do.

309
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,290
这个小玉呢   我就不怎么喜欢她
While Jade...I do not think I like her.

310
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,480
你知道为什么吗 因为她跟你年轻时候一模一样
Do you know why? Because she is the same as you are yourself.

311
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:28,220
女人心海底针啊 我告诉你啊
No man can tell what will come out of her.And here is another thing:

312
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:33,630
我们家老二可不会嫌弃她 就像我当年也不会嫌弃你一样
Our second son will never tire of her as I have never tired of you.

313
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:57,520
今天可是头一回 你舍得等我
This is the first time I found you waiting for me.

314
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,600
那谁先聊
Who will speak first, then?

315
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,510
你先 你想知道我什么
You. Ask me what you will.

316
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,400
那个
Well, then...

317
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,610
你最近老在想什么事情
What are you thinking all day?

318
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:19,710
我想很多事情 同时想二三十件事情
I think 20 and 30 things at a time.

319
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:22,820
我的脑子根本停不下来 就像上了发条的机器一样
My thoughts are like a chain,and one is fast to the other.

320
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:27,150
- 那是关于什么的 - 我在想鸟为什么会飞
- But what are they? - I think of the bird and how it flies.

321
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,190
我怎么就不能也从地上飞起来
And why is it I cannot lift myself above the earth.

322
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,760
那现在呢 现在你在想什么
But now, what are you thinking now?

323
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:36,620
现在
Now?

324
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:39,360
啥都不想
I think nothing.

325
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,300
哦 那...
Well, then...

326
00:21:43,910 --> 00:21:47,340
那么第一次你看到我的,你又在想些什么呢
...what did you think of me the first time you saw me?

327
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:52,570
我还真记不起来了
我是说....
I cannot remember.
No, I mean... I mean...

328
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,580
我们结婚之 后
...after we were married.

329
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,890
我看到你比我长得高 觉得很高兴 因为我也是个大高个
I was glad you were taller than I.For a woman, I am too tall.

330
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:04,220
你不高 然后你当时还想些什么呢
No, you are not. Then what did you think?

331
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:08,990
然后我在想 你会怎么看我
And then I wondered what you thought of me.

332
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:11,530
你知道我想要你的啊
But you knew that I wanted you.

333
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,640
- 然后 我再想... - 想啥
- And then I wondered... - Yes?

334
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:18,140
我再想你会不会给我我要的东西
I wondered if you would give me the thing I would have.

335
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,500
告诉我什么东西 我去买给你
Tell me. I will buy it for you.

336
00:22:23,310 --> 00:22:24,870
买
Buy?

337
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:27,570
我要的东西估计你都买不到
Perhaps all the things I want cannot be bought.

338
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:31,580
女人不都喜欢小礼物嘛 告诉我是什么
All women like presents. Tell me what it is.

339
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,520
我想要...
I want...

340
00:22:35,590 --> 00:22:37,020
一对耳环
Earrings.

341
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:39,850
这个啊 一对耳环而已
Yes, that is it. A pair of earrings.

342
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:42,620
我明早就去给你买
I will buy them for you tomorrow.

343
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:48,230
- 这样你就开心啦 - 是吧
- Now have I made you happy?  - Yes.

344
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:53,170
等等 我还是不开心 我不想要耳环了
No. You have not made me happy. I do not want earrings.

345
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,830
但是肯定有什么东西我可以买来让你开心的啊
But there is something that can be bought that I would have.

346
00:22:57,010 --> 00:23:00,040
- 那就给我一本书吧 - 一本书
- Buy me a book. - A book?

347
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:02,710
- 但是你不识字啊  - 我识字的
- But you cannot read. - I can read.

348
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:05,220
- 女人都不认识字的啊 - 我学过
- Women like you never read. - I learned.

349
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:08,580
我哥哥教过我 虽然每次也就一两个词
A word or two at a time. My brother could read and I learned from him.

350
00:23:08,760 --> 00:23:10,990
每天也就那么一点点
A little every day.

351
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:12,750
不过我从来没有属于自己的书
But I have no book of my own.

352
00:23:14,830 --> 00:23:17,360
我从来没看到我们家里有哪一个女人会读书的
I never thought to see a woman read in this house.

353
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:21,090
但是家庭主妇也得为了自己的生活而做出点改变啊
There must be changes even in a household if there is to be life and growth.

354
00:23:21,270 --> 00:23:24,500
我也不清楚 其实像我爹我娘这样也没什么不好
I do not know that.My mother and my father have done well.

355
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:29,240
-但他们是老一代人 我们可是新时代人 - 我可搞不清自己是不是新时代人
- But they are of the old. We are of the new. - Oh, I am not sure if I am of the new.

356
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,440
不过我还是会给你买本书的
I will buy you the book.

357
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:37,570
- 你生气啦 - 哪有 我可舍不得生你的气
- You are angry? - There is no room in my mind for anger.

358
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,310
只不过...
It is...

359
00:23:39,860 --> 00:23:42,760
这些事情我不是很了解你而已
It is just that I do not understand.

360
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:18,580
- 给你请安了 周先生  - 谢谢你
- Ten thousand greetings, Mr. Chow. - Thank you.

361
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,750
- 你还好吧 小伙子 - 还不错
- You are well, young sir? - Yes.

362
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:26,830
- 我想见见我姐夫吴连 - 他在里头呢 正在早休
- I would see my brother-in-law, Wu Lien.  - He is within. He takes his morning rest.

363
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,040
这屋里的人 都睡着了吗
Are all asleep in this house?

364
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:44,740
早安 姐夫 早安 老太太
I greet you, my brother-in-law. And your honored mother.

365
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,680
欢迎欢迎 快坐下
Welcome, welcome. Sit down.

366
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:50,120
孩子他娘 你二弟来了
Here's your second brother,mother of my children.

367
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:52,090
- 快坐快坐 - 谢谢
- Sit down, sit down. - Thanks.

368
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,250
你还是老样子啊 土里土气的
Well, then, you're a farmer and one who looks it.

369
00:24:55,430 --> 00:24:58,630
指甲里面全是泥巴啊
The dirt is still beneath your fingernails.

370
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:02,240
二弟 家里老人跟其他人都还好吧
My brother, how are the old ones and all of the others?

371
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,700
- 都还好 你有心啦  - 来 快点告诉我
- Well, thank you. - Tell me...

372
00:25:03,870 --> 00:25:06,900
是不是我弟妹怀孕了
...is my sister-in-law, Jade,with child yet?

373
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,810
你居然对小孩不感兴趣的啊
Can it be you take no interest?

374
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:12,640
谁像你啊 两个小孩你都不嫌烦
It would seem you take interest enough for both.

375
00:25:12,810 --> 00:25:15,340
- 我再怎么烦 我二弟也还是当不了爹啊 - 你说的是
- My interest will never make him a father. - No.

376
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,920
我想你也饿了 我看得出来
But you are hungry. I can tell.

377
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:21,780
这城里的每个人都应该学我
In each generation, a city man should do as I have done.

378
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,890
娶个乡下老婆
Take for a wife a woman from the country.

379
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:28,960
这样生出来的小孩才能又结实又强壮
Thus the line...Thus the line is kept strong and hard.

380
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:32,760
是啊 看看这小孩跟你一样的聪明啊
And here is the proof of your wisdom.

381
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:37,270
姐夫
Brother-in-law?

382
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:40,040
你能不能帮我出一下主意
Will you dip into your wisdom and tell me a thing?

383
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,940
可以吗 我知道你是个读书人
Yeah? I know you're a man who reads.

384
00:25:42,110 --> 00:25:43,980
是啊 是啊 我是读过几年书
Yes. Yes, I read.

385
00:25:44,150 --> 00:25:47,710
不过大多数也只是在冬天取暖或者夏天乘凉的时候才翻翻
Often in the winter to warm my blood.Sometimes in the summer to cool it.

386
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,880
如果你想买本书 你会买什么书
If you were to buy a book,what book would it be?

387
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,720
书可是有好多种类的啊
Well, there are books for every need.

388
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:00,990
如果你是要那种玉女心经什么的书
If a man wishes to read secretly for his own private pleasure...

389
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,790
我现在手头倒是有几本
...there are books for that.

390
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,260
不是 那你究竟是要什么书啊
No? Well then,for what is your book wanted?

391
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:09,000
我娶了个老婆比较特别
I married my woman thinking her like any other one and...

392
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:12,770
她告诉我想要一本书看看
Now I find out she can read and wants a book.

393
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:14,570
这样啊
So.

394
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,900
孩子他娘 你也是个女人家
You're only a woman, mother of my children...

395
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,810
如果你会读书的话 你想读本什么样的书
...but if you could read, what would you like to read?

396
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:22,070
- 我压根就没想过这事 - 等等我想到一本了
- I never thought...  - I have thought of the one.

397
00:26:22,250 --> 00:26:25,980
里面什么都有 里面说无论强弱 人都是有罪的
It has everything in it. The good prosper and the wicked are punished.

398
00:26:26,150 --> 00:26:30,320
- 这个书的名字就叫做  - 我们都是兄弟姐妹
- The name of the book is  - All Men Are Brothers.

399
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:32,960
- 谢谢你 我会记住这个书名的 - 老板
- Thank you. I will remember what you... - Sir.

400
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,650
老板 老板 不好了
Sir. Sir, there is something.

401
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,700
- 又是上次那些大学生  - 这次比上次还糟糕 事儿闹大了 老板
- As before? - Worse than before. Much louder, sir.

402
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:43,130
他们说已经警告过你很多次了 他们现在没耐心了
They said they have warned you many times and their patience is at an end.

403
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,330
这帮黄毛学生只会惹是生非
These students cause trouble.

404
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:49,500
难道我一个老实生意人都没法过安稳日子了吗
An honest merchant cannot live in peace these times.

405
00:26:49,950 --> 00:26:51,170
我说 怎么啦
Well, what is this?

406
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:53,840
我们再次警告你 别再跟日本鬼子做生意
We ask you once more, do not deal with the Japanese.

407
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,820
我们国家正在跟日本打仗 你不能一边卖日货 一边说自己爱国
We're at war. You cannot buy and sell Japanese goods and call yourself a patriot.

408
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:00,320
你们这么一说 还让不让人活了啊
Do you ask me to stop breathing in and out?

409
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,650
我这儿可是正经生意 有钱赚的你们懂不
There's a call for these, and a profit in them.

410
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,790
你们学生省点功夫 天下就太平了
Save your breath for arguments you can win.

411
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,950
那我们现在就让你不太平!
Then we must speak to you in words you can hear.

412
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:17,030
- 通通给我砸了 - 住手 你们这些强盗 住手
- Leave nothing. - Stop. You are vandals. Stop.

413
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:20,200
砸掉所有日货
Destroy all Japanese goods.

414
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:23,140
我们得让他知道自己的所作所为
We must make him understand what he has done.

415
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:28,250
强盗啊  小偷啊 你们会付出代价的 你们这些小偷
Bandits. Thieves.You'll pay for this. Thieves.

416
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:30,350
这是唯一可以让他明白的办法
This is the only way to make him see.

417
00:27:42,030 --> 00:27:45,400
今天的事情 也会发生在任何跟日本人做生意的地方
What's happens here will happen to every shop that sells Japanese goods.

418
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,400
不 不
No. No.

419
00:27:47,570 --> 00:27:50,440
吴连跟那些剥削你们血汗钱的人是一样的
Wu Lien walks hand in hand with those who deal in your blood.

420
00:27:50,610 --> 00:27:53,670
我只是个生意人啊 为什么砸掉我的东西啊
I'm only a merchant. Why do you destroy my goods?

421
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,440
他做日本人的生意 日本鬼子用这些钱反过来杀害我们
He pays for Japanese goods in money that'll come back to us in pain and death.

422
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:01,670
没有没有 我只做清白生意啊 没有害人啊
No, no, I deal only in innocent things that harm no one.

423
00:28:01,850 --> 00:28:04,410
这个吴连 爱钱胜过爱我们国家
This man, Wu Lien, loves his cash box above his country.

424
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,550
那不是真的 不是真的啊
That is not true. That's not true.

425
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,660
跟这种人划清界限吧 他跟日本鬼子没什么两样
Turn away from this traitor as you would turn from the Japanese.

426
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:11,050
走
Come.

427
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:14,490
你怎么能这么说呢
How can you say that?

428
00:28:16,030 --> 00:28:18,360
这可是我毕生经营的生意啊
Can it be that the thing I have done all my life...

429
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:21,400
怎么现在我就成了个罪犯了呢
...is now held against me as a crime?

430
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:25,800
你看到没
Did you see...?

431
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:29,740
这些生意人现在都像躲着远远的
Did you see those merchants turn away from me as from a bad odor?

432
00:28:29,910 --> 00:28:33,510
- 他们跟我没什么两样啊 - 想开点 姐夫 一切都会过去的
- They are of my own kind. - Be of stout heart, my brother. It will pass.

433
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:36,850
不不不 我可不这么认为 我又不傻
No, no, I do not think it will and I'm not a stupid man.

434
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:41,110
我得好好计划一下 不然以后这日子没法过了
I must turn this thing over in my mind.Decide what to do in the days I see ahead.

435
00:28:41,290 --> 00:28:44,620
我得掂量一下该怎么做
I must think and weigh what comes out.

436
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,120
好好计划一下
And think again.

437
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:06,600
那个陌生青年跳下来 走的远远的
And then this strange young man jumped down, ran away and was gone.

438
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:09,810
- 他是强盗吗  - 不是 听说只是一个大学生而已
- Was he a bandit, then? - No, it was said he was a student.

439
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:12,950
你今天碰到这破事 然后还跑去买了本破书
First you encounter this trouble and then you buy a book.

440
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:16,220
小玉的那本书吧 叫什么名字来着
This book that Jade now has, what is it?

441
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:18,920
- 应该有书名的吧 - 是有的
- Books have names. - So has this one.

442
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:23,030
- 叫 我们都是兄弟姐妹  - 我们都是兄弟姐妹
- It is called All Men Are Brothers. - All Men Are Brothers?

443
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,260
那上次我们说的 那个站在我们地里头的陌生人
What of the stranger who lives on the other side of the earth...

444
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:29,600
偷割我们的小麦的那个 也是我们兄弟姐妹 我可不这么想
...and reaps his grain on my land? Is he my brother? I think not.

445
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,700
你们这么一说 我今天倒是看了一下地里 今年萝卜长得有点小
Today I pulled a turnip.They grow small this year.

446
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:36,040
我在想啊 会不会就是那个素不相识的兄弟干的好事呢
Can it be this strange brother is pulling at the roots to plague us?

447
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:38,870
我觉得就是那王八羔子干的
It's good to have him to blame.

448
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:43,510
一本书噢 小玉终于有书可以读了
A book. And Jade can read in it.

449
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:47,010
你看看 又动起新念头了吧 一本书啊
You see? An idea spreads. A book.

450
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,780
我得再说一遍 这种东西 给了女人可不是什么好事情
I have said and say again it is wrong to give a woman such a dangerous thing.

451
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,150
是不合理 我老婆是不可能有本书看的
It is unnatural and mine will never have one.

452
00:29:53,330 --> 00:29:57,030
万一你老婆有了小孩呢 她如果没看完书的话 会有什么打算
What if a child comes? What will your woman do if she has not finished the book?

453
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,760
难道她可以一边看书 一边生小孩
Will she read on and let the child be born anyhow?

454
00:29:59,930 --> 00:30:01,830
她自己应付得了
She will manage.

455
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,870
今天累死了我想去睡觉了
The day has been full.

456
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,470
明天还有活要干呢
There's work tomorrow.

457
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:09,670
好的 儿子 你看起来眼皮都快掉下来了
Yes, my son. Your eyes are heavy with weariness.

458
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:12,540
你老婆在等你呢 二弟 手里还拿着一本书呢
Your wife waits for you, brother, with a book in her hands.

459
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,210
书是可以收起来放在旁边的
Even a book can be closed and put away.

460
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:28,160
那只是一本书 你居然为了它都不瞧我一眼
It is but a book, and yet it keeps your eyes from me.

461
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,260
来 坐我身边
Come sit beside me.

462
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:36,460
我告诉你我看到了什么
I will tell you what I have read.

463
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:38,660
我怎么知道你真的在看书
How shall I know if you read truly?

464
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:41,810
你知道我不会撒谎的
You will know I could not make up such things.

465
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:47,270
这里 书里面说了如果每个人贪婪的下场会是什么
In this place, it tells what happens when men know only greed.

466
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:51,390
里面也说和平是怎么失去的 还有人怎么相互残杀
It tells how peace is then lost, and what men may do to each other.

467
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:52,850
太神奇了
It is magic.

468
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:57,460
你的眼睛看着这些鸟脚印 然后嘴巴就说出来了...
Your eyes pick up those bird tracks and your eyes give them to your voice...

469
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,990
然后我也就听到了
...and your voice gives them to my ears.

470
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:05,430
还有这里 里面还说了些杀人啊,
And here, it tells how then there is killing...

471
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,470
打仗啊甚至是折磨人的事情
...and fighting and even torture.

472
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:10,070
哦 折磨人是不对的
Oh, it is wrong to torture.

473
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:15,570
- 里面是这么说的啊 - 太神奇了啊
- That is what it says. - It is magic.

474
00:31:17,710 --> 00:31:19,840
你都没再听我说
You do not listen.

475
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:21,970
我有在听
I try.

476
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:24,520
你用心点啊
You must try harder.

477
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:29,220
买书是要花钱的 我们可不能浪费钱
Money was spent for this book. We must not waste it.

478
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,120
我知道 我们也不能浪费老天给予我们的东西
We must waste nothing that is given to us.

479
00:31:32,290 --> 00:31:36,420
无论是钱 还是我们在一起的时间
Neither money,nor the hours we have together.

480
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:42,000
你这样看着我 我都读不了书
I cannot read when you keep watching me.

481
00:31:42,170 --> 00:31:44,760
反正我书里面的东西 我又看不懂
Since I cannot look at the book and know what it means...

482
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:46,500
我就只能看着你罗
...I must look at you...

483
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:50,470
钱不能浪费 时间也不能浪费啊
...so the money will not be wasted, and nothing else.

484
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:53,270
那我教你读书吧
Then I will teach you to read.

485
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:06,950
这个是个词
There is word here...

486
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:12,620
它的意思是说我们必须反抗所有让我们变成软蛋的事情
...of how men must rise up and resist the things that make them weak.

487
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,930
我可不这么认为
That is advice I cannot take.

488
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,760
你呢
Can you?

489
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:21,030
哎呀 你根本没在听我说话啊
Well, you will not listen.

490
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:24,110
你看 你现在又把书拿走了
And now you place the book where my hand cannot reach it.

491
00:32:24,280 --> 00:32:27,580
- 那我是不是要把它放回来啊 - 是的
- Shall I put it back within your grasp? - Yes.

492
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,750
算了
No.

493
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,370
我也想睡觉了
I will rest my eyes now.

494
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:51,900
下次我再教你吧
I will teach you to read another time.

495
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:55,770
下次我要是想读书了 我再提醒你
I will remind you when I'm ready for reading.

496
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:59,540
愿老天原谅我说出这种大逆不道的话
Let the gods forgive me for saying this but I am wicked.

497
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:02,340
我爱你胜过爱我的父母
I love you more than I love my father and my mother.

498
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:05,750
我比你更加大逆不道 因为我就喜欢你说这样的话
I am more wicked than you. I want to hear you tell me this.

499
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,390
如果东西只够爹娘还有你吃
If there were food enough only for them or for you...

500
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:11,350
我宁可让他们挨饿 也要让你吃饱饭
...I would give it to you and let them starve.

501
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:17,130
你愿意亲近我 这可是破天荒的头一回啊
You turn to me of your own will, and it is the first time this has been so.

502
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:22,030
是的 给你今晚的奖励 因为你说了我喜欢说的话
Yes, for this night, you have told me the thing my heart needed to hear.

503
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,870
现在我知道你是在乎我的感受跟想法的 也开始慢慢理解我了
Now I know that you'll care what I think and feel, and what I am.

504
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:29,200
而不仅仅是想着让我给你煮饭 生儿子
Not only that I give you children and make your food.

505
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:31,850
我不仅仅属于这个家
I know that I'm not only to belong to your house...

506
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,880
我更属于你
...but I am to be yours.

507
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:36,610
这样我也知足了
And I am content.

508
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:32,070
你迟到了啊 是不是遇到了什么麻烦
You're late. Did you once more have trouble...

509
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,730
难道又逃不出我娘的法眼啦
...escaping my mother's eyes?

510
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:36,740
从今天开始 我想去哪儿就去哪儿
From this day on, I will come to you openly.

511
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,440
娘不会再说我什么闲话了
She will say nothing.

512
00:34:38,610 --> 00:34:40,880
我可不认为娘这老顽固会变得这么快
I cannot believe my mother will change that much.

513
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:43,480
不是娘 是我
No. But I have changed.

514
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,550
你没看出来我有什么不同吗
Do you not see it?

515
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:47,880
你眼睛温柔了一点
Your eyes are as soft.

516
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,390
头发摸起来也柔软一点
Your hair as pleasant to my touch.

517
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,320
不过 我还是看不出来
No, I cannot see this change...

518
00:34:53,490 --> 00:34:55,620
我倒是希望还是老样子
...and I do not wish a change.

519
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,030
是我肚子里面的
It is within me.

520
00:34:59,230 --> 00:35:02,130
这变化大到连我自己 都没办法掩盖这脸上的喜悦
But it is so great I thought it must show on my face.

521
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:06,360
这又是哪门子东西引起的变化啊 又是什么时候开始的啊
What is the cause of this great difference? And when did it begin?

522
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:10,940
从我们第一次彼此敞开心扉的那个晚上开始的 老公
On the night we first opened our hearts to each other, my husband.

523
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:14,880
即使她只是个女的 我也心满意足了
Even if it is only a girl, I shall be very happy.

524
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,180
我们要当父母啦
We shall be ancestors?

525
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:21,350
- 他肯定是个儿子 - 我也祈求上天能赐给我一个儿子
- Oh, it will be a son. - I shall ask the gods for one.

526
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,920
但是如果是一个女儿 你也会爱护她吗
But if it is only a girl,she still will be welcome?

527
00:35:24,090 --> 00:35:26,030
会的 只要她是我们的女儿 我就会一直爱护她
If you're her mother,she will be welcome.

528
00:35:26,190 --> 00:35:28,560
然后我们教她读书
And she will be taught to read...

529
00:35:28,730 --> 00:35:32,430
虽然她爹总是忙一些不起眼的粗活
...even if her father is always too busy with lesser things.

530
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:34,500
要不然这小姑娘住哪啊
Where would this upstart daughter be...

531
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:37,900
我干这些粗活不就是为了她嘛
...if I did not busy myself
with those lesser things?

532
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,580
天啊 我太开心了
Oh, this is a good moment.

533
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:46,440
这真是我人生遇过的最幸福的时刻了
The best in my life so far.

534
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,870
- 有东西掉下来了  - 看起来像银色的蛋
- Something falls. - It shines like silver.

535
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,610
快看地里 冒起黑色的喷泉了
Look at the earth. It's a black fountain.

536
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:47,840
一个可以容得下50个人的大坑啊
A hole big enough to bury 50 men.

537
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:50,200
还在冒烟呢
And smokes still comes from it.

538
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:53,710
如果刚刚有人站在这里 他早就见阎王去了
If one of us had stood near here, he would no longer live.

539
00:36:53,880 --> 00:36:57,780
这十年来我一直想挖个池塘的 这次省事多了
I've wanted to dig a pond on my land for 10 years, and here it is.

540
00:36:57,950 --> 00:37:00,980
如果那些日本鬼子 只是用他们的飞船
It would be better if the barbarians did use the sky ships...

541
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,590
来挖挖池塘 挖挖井的话就好了
...to dig ponds and wells.

542
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:05,950
- 听起来不错啊 - 快看 那里也冒烟了
- Maybe it is an idea. - Look. Look, rolling smoke.

543
00:37:07,030 --> 00:37:09,900
跟那电影上的一样啊
It was the same in the magic pictures.

544
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:14,070
城墙都着火了 外面也是
There are many fires over the city wall and small ones outside.

545
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:16,970
- 飞船好像是从烟里面飞过来的 - 我们该怎么办
- Flying ships come out of the smoke. - What shall we do?

546
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:19,610
得有人去趟城里
Someone of us should go to the city.

547
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,570
我老婆担心大姐会不会出事了
My... My wife thinks of our elder sister and what happens to her.

548
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,470
我们都应该商量一下的 我去吧
We should all think of that. I'll go.

549
00:37:25,650 --> 00:37:29,050
别着急 老表 如果是好事 它不会长了腿自己跑掉的
I would not be hasty, cousin. If it is good news, it will not spoil.

550
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,410
但是如果是坏事 早去晚去都一样
The more slowly one hears bad news, the better.

551
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:34,490
我走还是不走 我那老婆子可不会让我干等着
My woman wouldn't let me rest if I didn't go, nor could I rest.

552
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:37,180
- 让我跟你一起去吧 爹 - 好 快点
- Let me go in your place. - All right, go quickly.

553
00:37:37,360 --> 00:37:40,350
看看你能帮上什么忙 大伙赶紧都回去干活吧
Do what you can. The rest of us should go back to our work.

554
00:37:53,810 --> 00:37:57,370
不会是我们儿子吧 真不敢相信啊
Can it be our son at last? I'm afraid to believe it is.

555
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,710
我们死定了 我们死定了
We're all but dead. We're all but dead.

556
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,050
离街十步远都可能被杀掉啊
We might have been killed had we been 10 feet nearer to street.

557
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:08,880
天要塌下来了啊 天要塌下来了啊
There was such noise.There was such noise.

558
00:38:09,060 --> 00:38:11,020
商店都关了一半了
The shop half gone.

559
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:13,820
除了烂命一条 我们现在什么都没有了
We have nothing but our bare lives in our hands.

560
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,730
什么都没有了 什么都没有了
We're lost. All is lost. All.

561
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,800
从早到晚 飞船飞来飞去
All day the flying ships came.

562
00:38:18,970 --> 00:38:22,530
然后炸弹掉下来 房子就炸成了灰烬
And everywhere the silver eggs dropped, they burst the buildings into dust.

563
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:25,540
店铺跟货物全毁了
And the shops and all the goods within are waste.

564
00:38:25,710 --> 00:38:27,440
- 人怎么样了啊 - 人
- But what of the people? - The people...

565
00:38:27,610 --> 00:38:29,540
都炸成块了 就像瓦片一样炸成碎片了
Into pieces, as if they were made of clay.

566
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:32,680
- 东一条胳膊 西一个头的 一块一块的... - 为什么啊 为什么啊
- Here an arm, there a head, there a piece... - But why? Why?

567
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:35,870
怎么可以这样对待其他人呢 我们可是在同一片天空下生活的呀
How can men do this to other men? The sky is over us all.

568
00:38:36,050 --> 00:38:38,140
我们的佣人都死了
Our own servants and the clerks are dead.

569
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:41,690
多老实忠厚的一个年轻小伙啊 我们下次去哪里找这样一个人啊
And one such an honest young man.Where shall we find one like him again?

570
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:45,550
现在老实人也没人要了 哪里还有店铺需要伙计帮忙的啊
What is the use, even of an honest man,if there's no shop to put him in?

571
00:38:45,930 --> 00:38:48,120
我们的店 我们的货啊 全完蛋了啊 全完了
Our shops, our goods, gone, all gone.

572
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:50,160
我只是一个想过太平日子的生意人而已啊
I'm a man who can prosper only in peace.

573
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:53,230
难道那些学生说的事情都是真的啊
Can it be those students who cried out spoke the truth?

574
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:55,370
真的 现在什么才是真的
The truth? Now, what is the truth?

575
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:57,630
还有谁能分得清真假
Each men sees it differently.

576
00:38:57,810 --> 00:39:00,470
我听到的是 东洋鬼子要过来了
The truth I see is that the East Ocean people will come...

577
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:03,240
他们会打进城里 然后占领整个城市的
...and enter the city, and the city will fall.

578
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,940
- 然后 国家也就快了 - 怎么可能
- Yes, and so will the nation. - Can that be?

579
00:39:06,150 --> 00:39:08,550
我们国家都是人 我们不就是那些人吗
The nation is only the people, and we are the people.

580
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,780
- 我们人活着 国家就应该还在啊 - 我们还不够强大啊
- And while we remain, so does the nation. - We're not strong enough.

581
00:39:11,950 --> 00:39:15,390
为什么不够强大 我们难道没有可以杀人的东西吗
Why are we not strong enough? Why do we not have things to kill with too?

582
00:39:15,560 --> 00:39:18,620
我们这些农村人对他们而言没什么用
They have no use to people like us who love only to live.

583
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:20,450
这样我们可就死定了啊
Then we will die.

584
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:25,590
人固有一死的 不过我觉得不应该是这个样子的
Death is each men's natural end, and that I know. But not this kind.

585
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:30,260
人人都这么想过 除非他亲身经历过
This is beyond the mind of man unless he sees it for himself.

586
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,070
我得做些什么事情
That I must do.

587
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:09,830
快一点 那是我老公啊
Hurry. It is my husband.

588
00:40:10,010 --> 00:40:13,170
他被埋在废墟里面了
He's here beneath this rubbish.

589
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:20,340
这是他的手啊 我认得出来
It is his hand! I would know it anywhere.

590
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,090
我的天啊!
Oh, my God!

591
00:40:26,030 --> 00:40:28,500
这场面有点让人受不了 我不会怪你的孩子
It is too much to bear, and I do not blame you.

592
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,360
看看我们能帮忙做些什么事情 过来
We must see what can be done here. Come.

593
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:00,360
村里都快被逃难的人流围成了孤岛了
Our village has become an island in a river of fleeing people.

594
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:04,690
但是他们都被吓到走不动了
But they cannot run fast enough to forget the horror behind them.

595
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:08,490
爷爷有事要跟大伙说
My grandfather will speak to you now.

596
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:23,840
我知道你们希望我可以帮你们解决眼前这些麻烦事
I know that you are looking to me to save you from this great trouble.

597
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:26,350
但是我没办法 我已经试过了
I've been trying to find a way but I cannot.

598
00:41:26,520 --> 00:41:28,450
我现在连自己都救不了
I cannot save myself.

599
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:32,520
我估计明天也还会是今天这样子
I know that what today was will be again tomorrow.

600
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:36,420
你们啊 我三个儿子啊 都是男子汉了 还有你吴连 你最年长
You, my three sons, are men. And you, Wu Lien, are older than they.

601
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:40,060
- 你们大伙也来说说看 - 我...
- If you have anything to say, then say it. - I...

602
00:41:40,230 --> 00:41:43,500
我也还没有想不出什么好方法可以救我们
I have not yet thought of any way to save any of us.

603
00:41:43,940 --> 00:41:46,840
眼下只有两条路可以走
There are two things which can be done.

604
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:50,170
要不然就是逃难去 躲开这些洋鬼子
One is to escape the evil by running away.

605
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:53,610
要不然就是留在这里听天由命
And the other is to let it come down and bear it.

606
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:57,110
如果这样的话 爹 你会选哪一个
In this, my father, I ask, what will you do yourself?

607
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,550
我会留下 这里可是生我养我的地方
Stay here where I was born and where I have lived.

608
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:02,120
那我也跟你一起留下来
Then I say I will do what you do.

609
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:04,350
我也留下
I, too, will stay.

610
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:06,830
但是 爹 我想逃难去
But I, my father, will escape it.

611
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:12,660
你们要走我没意见
I will say nothing to any who do go.

612
00:42:12,830 --> 00:42:16,270
留下来的人就跟我留下 想走的就走
Let those who will stay with me, and those who would go, let them go.

613
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:20,530
你这是在责备我吗 爹
You blame me, my father?

614
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,870
不是不是 我不责怪你 我的儿啊
No, no. I do not blame you, my son.

615
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:25,410
那我就按计划逃难去
Then do as I will do. Leave this place.

616
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:28,410
我也想把地像布料一样卷起来带走 这样好跟你一起逃难去...
If I could roll up my land like a cloth and take it with me...

617
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:31,140
但是这是不可能的事情啊
...but that is impossible. No.

618
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:33,720
我留下 儿子 你走就是
No. I stay, my son. You are free to go.

619
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:38,890
我不想怕是因为我有所顾虑
I do not run away because I'm afraid.

620
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,230
我担心我没出生的孩子
I only fear for my coming child.

621
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,890
我有孙子啦
A grandchild?

622
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,190
这是好消息啊 儿子
That is good news, my son.

623
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:51,170
这样你更应该走了
And I think it well that you go.

624
00:42:51,340 --> 00:42:53,070
你打算什么时候走 老二
When will you leave us, brother?

625
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,800
我们还没有决定
We have yet time.

626
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:58,310
我们会等到有合适的人 再一起走
We will wait until we find those we would go with.

627
00:42:58,750 --> 00:43:02,680
我可不认为这样做是好的 我觉得小玉应该留下来把小孩生下
I do not like this talk. I do not see why Jade should be taken away.

628
00:43:03,380 --> 00:43:07,080
是不是只要这样我才能照顾我的小孩呢 娘
It is only that I may finish what I was made to do, my mother.

629
00:43:07,250 --> 00:43:09,650
我是怕你生产的时候 谁还来照顾你啊
But who will look after you when your time comes?

630
00:43:09,820 --> 00:43:12,950
我孙子不可能像个畜生一样在荒郊野外出生啊
Why should our grandson be born somewhere in a field like an animal?

631
00:43:13,130 --> 00:43:14,990
他们最好还是离开这里
It may be better that they go.

632
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:19,030
因为我们不知道会发生什么 说不定陌生人就闯进门了呢
We do not know what lies ahead. Strange feet may enter our gate.

633
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:22,640
如果我儿子要走 我不拦他 但是小玉得留下
If my son wants to go, he will go. But let Jade stay.

634
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:25,970
怎么说她怀的可是老凌家的骨肉啊
我觉得不应该留下
Her duty to you comes first.
I think it does not.

635
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:28,200
女人应该陪着她丈夫一起走的
A woman should go with her man.

636
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:57,430
最近很多人从这里逃难过去了
There are so many who flee these past weeks.

637
00:43:57,610 --> 00:44:00,540
地里面的路都被走变形了
The whole face of the earth must be changing.

638
00:44:09,950 --> 00:44:11,920
老表 那又是什么东西
Cousin, what comes now?

639
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:14,920
他们好像拖着奇怪的玩意儿
These carry different burdens.

640
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:18,550
前进!
Move along!

641
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:23,160
前进!
Move along!

642
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:40,740
注意看路
Keep to the road!

643
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,510
这又是什么蠢东西啊
What foolishness is this?

644
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:52,630
只有城里人才会费力气去背一堆破铜烂铁
Only a city man would break his back under the weight of iron...

645
00:44:52,790 --> 00:44:55,090
而不去背大米
...when he might carry a bag of rice.

646
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:58,360
你们这些人怎么不弄两个轮子造个车子 拖这些东西啊
Why did you not take two wheels and make a cart and ride?

647
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:02,240
看看这些蠢蛋 都快把这些金属玩意吃到肚子里了去了
Look at those fools. They will eat iron if they eat at all.

648
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:07,400
这不是金属 聪明的乡下朋友啊 我们搬的可是工厂的机器啊
This is not iron, my wise country friend.This is a factory we carry on our backs.

649
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,240
你们会慢慢习惯的
And you may as well get used to seeing such things...

650
00:45:10,410 --> 00:45:13,140
后面还有整个城市跟着我们呢
...for a whole city follows behind us.

651
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:17,480
他们跟其他人不一样 好像有组织有计划的
These are not as the others were. They seem to have a plan.

652
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:23,510
停!
停!
Halt!
Halt!

653
00:45:23,690 --> 00:45:25,850
我们就地休息一会
停!
We will rest now for a little while.
Halt!

654
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:29,260
休息!
休息!
Rest!
Rest!

655
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:30,760
我从来没有像今天这么累过
I've never been so tired.

656
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,770
你们怎么不在地里头休息啊
Why do you not sleep here in our land?

657
00:45:36,940 --> 00:45:39,460
这里还有水 我们可以分给你们一些
There is water, and we will share what we can with you.

658
00:45:39,640 --> 00:45:43,100
你人真好老大爷 但是我们不能离得太远
You are good to us as all have been, or we could not have come this far.

659
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:47,850
我们今晚得守着这些机器睡觉 我的农民朋友
We will rest here tonight with these, our friends.

660
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:23,670
我们打算跟这些人一起走 爹
These are the people we will join, my father.

661
00:46:26,190 --> 00:46:29,350
是的 他们就是我们要等的人
Yes. They are the ones we have waited for.

662
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,510
他们有坚定的决心跟必胜的勇气
They are strong and full of courage.

663
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:40,190
兄弟啊 我想问问你 你们这是要去哪里啊
I would ask you, my friend, where do you go?

664
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:43,030
我们的目的地在山上 离这里一千多里远
Our eyes are on the mountains, a thousand miles from here.

665
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:44,500
那你们去哪里做什么呀
What will you do there, sir?

666
00:46:44,670 --> 00:46:47,730
我们打算去安装这些机器 然后建立一个兵工厂
We'll set up these machines we carry, and they will be a factory.

667
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:50,000
为前线的抗日部队造枪支弹药
Then we'll make bullets and guns for the army.

668
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:51,970
那我们的部队呢
Where is our brave army now?

669
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,750
他们在前线跟鬼子打仗呢
They fight between you and the Japanese.

670
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:58,750
许多战士为了拖延鬼子为我们争取时间 都已经壮烈牺牲了
Many thousands of them have already died to delay the evil dwarfs from coming here.

671
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:01,910
我儿子可不可以加入你们的队伍
My son would join you in your journey if he is welcome.

672
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:04,750
我们欢迎你家的任何人加入我们
We would be happy to take something of yours with us.

673
00:47:04,930 --> 00:47:06,830
再带上他老婆你看行不
And what is a man without his wife?

674
00:47:07,490 --> 00:47:09,890
我够强壮 可以帮上忙的
I, too, am strong and can be of help.

675
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,830
好吧 我们也欢迎你
You are welcome also.

676
00:47:14,970 --> 00:47:17,490
这大风 看样子是要下雨了 对我们种田的是好事
The wind has brought rain. It is good for our land...

677
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:21,660
-但是对你们行军的就不好了吧 -如果对你们是好的 对我们也好
- ...but is it not bad for travelers? - If it helps you, then it must help us.

678
00:47:38,430 --> 00:47:40,860
我们马上要出发了 我还在担心是不是有点远呢
Now that we are to go, I wonder if it's too far.

679
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:42,890
就算别人倒下了 我也会继续前进的
I will be on my feet when others drop.

680
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:46,830
- 我真希望我能帮你带着小孩  -早晚有一天你会的
- I wish I could carry the child for you. - One of these days you shall.

681
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:49,590
我从来没想过我的孩子会出生在这样的地方..
I never thought a child of mine would be born anywhere...

682
00:47:49,770 --> 00:47:51,430
居然不是在这片土地上
...except here on this land.

683
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:53,300
他会找到属于自己的天地的
He will find a place of his own.

684
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:56,200
但是对任何一个人而言 他的出生地总是值得纪念的
It is very meaningful to a man where he is born.

685
00:47:56,380 --> 00:47:58,070
我们得留个纪念在这里啊
We must mark the place.

686
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,910
他还没出生 人生就已经从这里开始了
A man begins his life before he is born.

687
00:48:01,080 --> 00:48:04,570
没有比我们这棵大树更适合做记号的地方了
So, what better place to mark for him than our tree.

688
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:16,520
刻在那里...这样它也成了我们跟孩子的了
There. Now it will be his also.

689
00:48:19,230 --> 00:48:21,790
好了 大伙准备了!
All right, take your places!

690
00:48:21,970 --> 00:48:25,530
- 各就各位!- 各就各位!
- Take you places. - Take your places!

691
00:48:25,710 --> 00:48:29,340
我们必须在中午休息之前翻过这座大山
We must cross those hills before the midday rest.

692
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:32,840
各就各位!
Take your places!

693
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:35,480
我到处找了 还是没找到娘...
I've looked everywhere but I cannot find our mother...

694
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:37,050
好跟她道别的
...to say goodbye.

695
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:39,710
爹 告诉娘 我们很难过没有来得及跟她老人家道别
Tell her it is our sorrow that we could not find her.

696
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:44,420
我会转告她的 你们赶紧 别让别人等你们
I will tell her. You must not keep your friends waiting.

697
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,170
记得 如果小孩出生的话 给我们报个信
Send me word somehow when the child is born.

698
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:04,970
如果是个男孩 装一根红线在里面
If it is a boy, send a red cord in the envelope.

699
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:07,810
如果是女孩 就装根蓝色的
If it is a girl, let it be a blue one.

700
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,870
记住了孩子
Remember, my child...

701
00:49:10,050 --> 00:49:12,610
女人是根 男人是树
...that the woman is a root, and the man the tree.

702
00:49:12,790 --> 00:49:15,780
根固才能树茂啊.
The tree grows only as high as the root is strong.

703
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:18,360
我记住了爹
I will remember, my father.

704
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:20,020
走吧
Go.

705
00:49:23,530 --> 00:49:25,830
这是你的任务
This place is yours.

706
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:30,370
- 前进! - 前进!
- March! - March!

707
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:52,880
原来你在这里啊
So this is where you have been.

708
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:57,520
他们到处找你
They looked for you.

709
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:00,520
我不想跟他告别
I would not come to see him go.

710
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:04,460
看着他像牛一样被喝着拉着一堆破机器
Pulling, straining like an ox and bawling like one.

711
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:08,530
- 你怎么哭了  - 哪里有
- You have been weeping. - I have not.

712
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:11,230
被水花溅到而已
Splashed water on my face.

713
00:51:12,170 --> 00:51:14,970
他站在其他人旁边 看起来那么的瘦弱
He looked so small beside the others.

714
00:51:15,140 --> 00:51:19,600
哪里瘦弱 老二可是我们家最强壮的
He did not. He was the largest by far.

715
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:24,440
你是天底下最了不起的母亲啦 大洋彼岸都找不到更好的啦
You are the best mother in the province. Where is there one better beyond the seas?

716
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:26,420
我傻透了
I'm a fool.

717
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:29,650
我都开始想他们了 即便是小玉
I miss them already. Even Jade.

718
00:51:29,820 --> 00:51:34,190
是啊是啊 虽然他们走了 但是家里还是有一股劲儿在的
Yes, yes, some sort of strength has left the house with their going.

719
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:37,230
我可没说我要他们回来
I would not say I want them back.

720
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,090
他们想走就走 我可不拦他们
They want to go, they go.

721
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:45,430
我才不相信你冷酷无情呢 我还是更喜欢心直口快的你
I would not have you a cool, thin soul. I like you hot-tempered and gusty.

722
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:47,770
你个老不死的
You old turnip.

723
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:54,910
来吧 老头子 让我看看你脖子上的红点是怎么回事
Come here, old man. Let me see that spot on your neck.

724
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:58,680
- 会不会长了疖子什么的啊  - 肯定是蚊子咬的
- See if you have boil after all these years... - It's where a mosquito bit me.

725
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:01,450
不要告诉我怎么回事的 我自己来瞧瞧
Do not tell me what it is.I can see for myself.

726
00:52:03,990 --> 00:52:06,890
瞧 你是不是现在老到不能打蚊子了
Well, can you not catch a mosquito anymore?

727
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:09,590
是不是跟个小屁孩一样被咬到呱呱叫
Must you be bitten like a child?

728
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:11,290
瞧你个熊样
You're clumsy.

729
00:52:11,470 --> 00:52:14,300
你看 我就喜欢你口无遮拦 哪怕总是惹毛我
I like your quick tongue even when it is turned on me.

730
00:52:14,470 --> 00:52:16,030
老婆子啊 我告诉你
Old woman, I tell you this.

731
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:19,470
如果你先死了 我不会再娶的
If you should die before I die, even then I would not marry another.

732
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:23,510
没了你 这日子啊就像腌萝卜不放盐 一点味道都没有了
For after you, any would be like a carrot dried without salt.

733
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:33,440
敌人的枪声越来越近了
The guns of the enemy came ever closer.

734
00:52:33,620 --> 00:52:36,380
人们也开始逃难
 And still the people fled before them.

735
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:39,530
凌谭的乡亲们也都四处逃难了
Some of the kinsmen of Ling Tan fled also.

736
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:43,690
不过大多数人都还是留下了 继续在地里收割庄稼
But most of them stayed and went into the fields to reap the grain.

737
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:45,920
人们相互帮忙
And each man helped his neighbor...

738
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:50,000
只有有了收成 他们才像个农民
... for the harvest was at hand,and they were farmers.

739
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:54,470
无论战乱还是和平 他们都知道 总得有人种田好吃饱肚子
And war or no war, they knew they must bring their food from the earth...

740
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:58,580
所以无论什么事情来临 他们都得喂饱家里的每一个人
... so that whatever came, they could feed their families.

741
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:07,020
日复一日 飞机来了又走
Day after day, the flying ships came...

742
00:53:07,190 --> 00:53:09,920
继续轰炸着城里
... and then flew on and bombed the city.

743
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:13,220
凌家沟的人 也整天提心吊胆
The people of the valley of Ling were afraid.

744
00:53:13,390 --> 00:53:16,990
但是也只是偶尔看看天 然后就低头继续干活了
But they stopped only to look up and then turn back to their work...

745
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,930
他们也听说了 日本鬼子占领了...
... for they'd heard that the Japanese had taken the land...

746
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:22,190
沿岸以内几百里的土地了
 ... a hundred miles deep from the sea...

747
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:26,090
而且现在 正在向他们的城市逼近
... and were even now approaching the nearby city.

748
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:28,640
时间变得越来越紧迫了
Time, too, had become their enemy.

749
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:32,870
老天好像刻意跟他们作对一样
It seemed nature itself was against them.

750
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:35,040
今年雨季来的比往年要早
The rains were early that year.

751
00:53:35,220 --> 00:53:39,410
农民们既得跟风斗 又得跟雨斗 年复一年都如此
And the farmers fought the wind and the water as they always had.

752
00:53:39,590 --> 00:53:43,610
但是这些事情是他们可以弄明白的 这些事情也是可以克服的
Here was a thing they understood and, understanding, could defeat.

753
00:53:43,790 --> 00:53:47,120
但是内心的恐惧 却是无法克服的
But they could not defeat the fear that was in them.

754
00:53:47,290 --> 00:53:51,630
耳朵里天天都是炸弹轰炸的声音
For always in their ears was the sound of the bombardment.

755
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,100
震耳欲聋
A sound that was louder now...

756
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:59,070
他们也大概猜到 鬼子的部队离这里已经不远了
... and they knew that the enemy was storming the gates of the city.

757
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,810
然而这一天还是降临了
Then the day came.

758
00:54:10,980 --> 00:54:14,750
这是凌谭最害怕的一天
The day that Ling Tan dreaded above all others.

759
00:54:15,390 --> 00:54:17,410
枪声突然消失了
The guns were silent...

760
00:54:17,590 --> 00:54:21,550
飞机也不见了
... and the flying ships were gone from the air.

761
00:54:23,500 --> 00:54:26,260
相比打仗的声音 我更怕这种寂静
I fear this quiet more than the noise of battle.

762
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:28,490
因为它并不代表着和平
It does not mean peace.

763
00:54:28,670 --> 00:54:32,100
我们现在必须面对另外一种可能
It means but one thing, and we must face it.

764
00:54:32,270 --> 00:54:34,710
那就是城里已经失守了
The defenders of our city have been overcome.

765
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,240
此时此刻 说不定敌人就在门外面等着
And even now as I speak to you, the enemy is at our gates.

766
00:54:38,410 --> 00:54:40,780
- 不出几个小时 他们就打过来 - 这是真的
- Within hours, they will be upon us. - That is true.

767
00:54:40,950 --> 00:54:43,040
敌人走那么快 我们有没有武器
The enemy moves swiftly, and we have no arms.

768
00:54:43,220 --> 00:54:46,190
我们怎么反抗啊 难道用手啊
How can we resist him? Are we to fight him with our hands?

769
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:49,480
我来说说 你们听听看看
I speak for myself but you are welcome to listen.

770
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:51,280
我们阻止不了日本人
We cannot stop the Japanese, no.

771
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,720
但是只要他们占领了城里
But as soon as they have occupied a city...

772
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:56,120
我相信我们还是有办法的
...I believe we shall be able to deal with them.

773
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:57,520
你为什么怎么说
How can you say this?

774
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:00,720
我跟我父亲都日本人做过生意
I bought and sold their goods as did my father before me...

775
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:04,230
他们很友善的 从来不翻脸
...and I have found no great evil in the face they turned to me.

776
00:55:04,400 --> 00:55:07,030
只有那些毛头大学生跟我翻脸过
I did find evil in my own people, in green boys...

777
00:55:07,210 --> 00:55:10,010
他们莫名其妙把我的店跟货物砸得稀巴烂
...who burned my goods without reason.

778
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:13,410
吴连 如果他们来了你安然无事 我就相信你真的安然无事
Wu Lien, if when they come, you are right, I will say you are.

779
00:55:13,580 --> 00:55:17,350
万一他们翻脸了 我们除了听他们的话之外 还能做些什么呢
But even if you are not, what can we do but take their rule for ours also?

780
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,990
我们只求太平日子 安享晚年而已
All we want is peace and to be left alone to live.

781
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:23,950
- 时间紧迫啊 我们有什么计划啊 - 我们应该怎么迎接他们
- Our time is short. What is the plan? - How shall we meet them?

782
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:26,180
我们应该怎么表明我们的态度
How can we show them what is in our hearts?

783
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:29,260
我们除了自己之外还能知道什么呢 还是顺其自然吧
What ways do we know but our own? Let us do what we would do...

784
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:33,420
无论谁来了 我们至少有点骨气吧
...for any new ruler coming to our village, but let us keep our pride.

785
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:14,830
这都是些机器啊
But they are machines.

786
00:56:15,010 --> 00:56:18,270
我们怎么跟这些冒烟的机器谈判的
How can you talk to machines when they're belching smoke?

787
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:27,910
- 敌人来了 快去跟他们说 - 别敌人敌人的
- Speak, here is the enemy. - Do not use that word.

788
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:29,660
太君
Sirs...

789
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:33,220
太君 我仅代表...
Sirs, I am come...

790
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:36,520
太君 我们仅代表本村 ..
We are come, sirs...

791
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:38,060
太君 我们都是农民
Sir, we are only farmers...

792
00:56:38,230 --> 00:56:40,960
还有一两个生意人跟读书人
...a small merchant or two, and my cousin here the scholar.

793
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:43,970
- 我们都是明事理的老实人... - 你们的旅馆在哪里
- We are men of peace and reason... - Where is your inn, farmer?

794
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:45,970
- 带我们过去  - 但是...
- Lead us there. - But...

795
00:57:00,790 --> 00:57:03,260
店小二 店小二 来给我的士兵们倒水
Waiter. Waiter. Service for my soldiers.

796
00:57:03,420 --> 00:57:05,980
你们过去 靠墙边站好
You there, line up against the wall.

797
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:11,430
- 站好 老实点 别惹麻烦 - 我们还是走吧
- Steady, now. Give us no trouble. - Let's get out of here.

798
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:14,730
把他带过来 马上
Get him over here, right now.

799
00:57:18,270 --> 00:57:21,040
- 你病了吗 爹  - 不 不 不 没事
- You are ill, my father. - No, no, no. It's nothing.

800
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:23,640
- 上酒  - 上酒
- Wine with it. - Wine, wine.

801
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:27,010
拿过来
Over here.

802
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:29,810
给我拿酒来 不然我一枪毙了你
Wine.Bring the wine or we'll shoot you.

803
00:57:31,620 --> 00:57:34,110
这是茶 我们要的是酒 不要茶!
Tea. We want wine, not tea.

804
00:57:34,290 --> 00:57:37,050
- 酒   - 是的 我们要酒
- Wine? - Yes, wine.

805
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:40,120
但是我们这里没有酒啊
We... We have no wine.

806
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:42,280
我们只有过节的时候才有酒啊
We have that only on feast days.

807
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:44,520
哦 没有酒啊
Oh, no wine, huh?

808
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,100
那总有女人吧
And where are your women?

809
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:48,030
拿出点东西来犒劳一下皇军啊
There are other things than wine.

810
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,730
对 女人

他说要回去店里面一趟

村子里面 女人都被弄死在草丛里...
In the village, the young women are dead in the grass.

小兰 她以前是多么的傻 多么的胆小怕事啊
She was ever a poor, foolish little thing, without courage.

907

But she was my wife.

908
01:09:59,830 --> 01:10:03,660
我要离开这里

去哪里都无所谓 我就是不想继续呆在这里
I do not care where I go, but I cannot stay here.

912
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:18,740
我要跑到山里面加入游击队 然后打死这帮鬼子
I will go with those in the hills who fight this horror.

你也得休息一下先啊 现在别想太多
Rest today first. Do not think of it now.

914

帮帮老三收拾一下行李吧
Help our third son make ready for his journey.

916

记住啊儿子 痛苦终会过去的
Remember, my son,all weeping ceases at last.

917
01:10:58,990 --> 01:11:01,890
你弟弟比较鲁莽 我希望你能多留心他一下
Your brother's rash and foolish,and I will keep an eye on him.

918
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:04,490
我自己不能盯着他 也只能拜托给其他人了
If not my own, then one that I can trust.

919
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:07,720
我要你也一起进山 帮我照顾好他
I would have you follow him to the hills and watch over him for me.

920

- 你这是命令我吗 爹  - 是的
- Do you so command me, Father? - I do.

921
01:11:10,700 --> 01:11:12,830
山里
The hills.

922

在山里我也可以杀鬼子
There I, too, could fight.

923
01:11:16,010 --> 01:11:19,070
对 好让鬼子们血债血偿
Yes, I can pay these dwarfs some of what I owe them.

924
01:11:19,240 --> 01:11:22,230
我巴不得一巴掌就拍死他们一堆
I could kill them like lice in a winter coat.

925
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:33,020
从昨天开始 我们都是白发人送黑发人了 老表
Since this time yesterday, cousin,we have both lost sons.

926
01:11:39,530 --> 01:11:44,260
- 这公鸡还知道报晓 - 已经没什么必要了

我都感觉看不到明天了
I feel there is no tomorrow.

928
01:12:39,290 --> 01:12:41,310

我真是天打五雷劈啊
I'm of all creatures, the most unfortunate.

And now he shares it with us,his friends.

951
01:14:08,140 --> 01:14:12,880
你明天也搬过来跟我们一起吧
You will come there tomorrow.And live there.

952
01:14:13,620 --> 01:14:16,880
你会看到皇军对于服从的人是多么的慷慨
You'll see how merciful we are with those who do not resist us.

953
01:14:17,050 --> 01:14:18,490
好的 太君
Yes.

954
01:14:19,190 --> 01:14:22,920
这门上的大日本帝国国旗会保护你 一直到你搬过来为止
Our flag above your door will protect you until you come to us.

955
01:14:23,090 --> 01:14:28,500
谢天 谢地 谢太君啊
All my thanks, great one. Oh, even to 10,000 thousand.

956
01:14:36,810 --> 01:14:40,610
真庆幸我忍了这么几个月 如今我又可以跟家人团聚了
I'm more cheered than I've been for months.Now I can be with my household again.

957
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:44,770
我如此精打细算 简直就是诸葛亮在世啊
How wise am I to arrange my own affairs so well.

958
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:49,640
- 又死了一个  爱国者啊 什么是爱国
- Another patriot has died. - Patriot. What, then, is a patriot?

959
01:14:49,820 --> 01:14:53,120
难道就得为了国家而丢了自己的小命
To be one must a man die and let the worms eat his flesh?

960
01:14:53,290 --> 01:14:56,450
不 不 不 我可不这么想
No, no, no. I think not.

961
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:59,220
这些国家的事情都不关我的事
All these thing that happen are not my affair.

962
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:01,520
无论外面什么世道 我只是本分的生意人而已
Whatever comes, I'm a man of peace.

963
01:15:01,700 --> 01:15:05,220
老天给我什么东西 我就卖什么东西
And whatever heaven sends I will take and go on with my business.

964
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:08,130
如果大伙都停止这些愚蠢的抵抗 估计天下早就太平了
If this foolish resistance will stop there will be peace.

965
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:10,130
你不觉得吗
Do you not agree?

966
01:15:53,280 --> 01:15:56,450
农民们 以后这村子归皇军管了
Farmer, this country now belongs to us, your conquerors.

967
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:58,450
只有经过皇军同意 你们才可以种地
You must produce on your land as we say.

968
01:15:58,620 --> 01:16:01,890
所有的收成也归我们所有 价钱也由我们决定
And the harvest is to come to us at the price we tell you it shall be.

969
01:16:02,060 --> 01:16:05,720
不听皇军命令的人 将不会再有耕地
And those who disobey us will need their land no longer.

970
01:16:05,890 --> 01:16:08,860
- 但是他们抓走了我的鱼啊 那可是我的池塘 - 你什么也没有了
- But they take all the fish. The pond is mine. - Nothing is yours.

971
01:16:09,030 --> 01:16:11,590
你们难道都不明白 你们村已经被占领了吗
Will you village men never learn that you are conquered?

972
01:16:11,930 --> 01:16:14,990
太君啊 你们拿走了所有粮食 来年我们怎么生活 怎么播种啊
If they take all the rice, how can we live and plant in the spring?

973
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:18,970
你身上的脂肪也够你生活的了
You can live off your own fat and you will be given seed when the time come.

974
01:16:19,140 --> 01:16:20,940
你们把所有畜生都牵走了啊
You don't even leave us breeding stock.

975
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:25,170
我们帮你们养着 皇军是需要吃肉的
We will raise the animals henceforth and also eat them.

976
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:28,610
没了牛 谁来犁地啊
My ox. Who will pull the plow?

977
01:16:28,780 --> 01:16:31,450
你看起来也蛮强壮的啊
Your own back looks strong.

978
01:16:32,720 --> 01:16:34,750
我们孙子该怎么办啊
How would we feed our grandchildren now?

979
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:38,980
- 你怎么就不敢反抗了呢 - 我活着 才能保住我的土地啊
- Why did you not defy him? - Alive, I can hold my land.

980
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:42,600
如果死了 我就只能被埋在地里头了
Dead, I can only hold so much as I am buried in.

981
01:16:46,030 --> 01:16:51,130
当凌谭跟他的乡亲们努力维持生计的时候
So while Ling Tan and his kinsmen tried somehow to live on...

982
01:16:51,310 --> 01:16:54,170
那些兵工厂的人 正在用他们的双手
... those who had taken machines apart with their hands...

983
01:16:54,340 --> 01:16:59,470
一块一块的搬运机器继续前进
... so they could be carried piece by piece,were making their way forward.

984
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:04,850
泥泞阻挡不了他们 大雨也不行
Mud could not stop them. Nor could rain.

985
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:08,550
滂沱大雨淹没了一切
Rain that so filled the air that fish could have lived in it.

986
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:13,460
泥巴像阎王爷的小鬼一样 缠住了他们双脚
Mud so thick that it held them back like evil hands.

987
01:17:14,760 --> 01:17:17,960
河流三番两次切断了前进的道路
Water was made to cross and it was crossed many times.

988
01:17:18,130 --> 01:17:21,130
人们无法前进时 他们开始造船
And when it could not be walked in,boats were built.

989
01:17:21,300 --> 01:17:23,330
他们渡过江 渡过河
And the people rowed upon the water.

990
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:27,410
在江河上 谈笑风生
And were grateful for the moment that they need not walk.

991
01:17:31,410 --> 01:17:34,040
时间随着他们的脚步 一点一点流逝
Time came when the earth opened at their feet...

992
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:36,150
但是他们永不止步
... but they did not stop.

993
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:41,720
他们用破布、腰带 绳子做起了桥
They took what they had, rags and belts and ropes, and made bridges...

994
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:44,020
然后继续前进
... and passed over.

995
01:17:47,960 --> 01:17:50,830
最后他们终于到了到了高山道
And then they reached the high mountain passes...

996
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,900
一个没人到过的地方
... where no one had gone before.

997
01:17:53,070 --> 01:17:57,630
许多人饿到走不动了 一点力气都没有了
And many faltered, for food was gone and strength was near an end.

998
01:17:57,810 --> 01:18:00,210
人们步履蹒跚但是仍继续坚持
Many faltered but did not stop.

999
01:18:00,380 --> 01:18:03,170
没有什么可以阻挡他们前进的意志
Nothing could stop them but their own will.

1000
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:06,540
老二跟小玉也是一样
Nor could it stop Jade and Lao Er.

1001
01:18:06,720 --> 01:18:09,450
虽然时不时他们要休息一下
Although now and then, they rested...

1002
01:18:09,620 --> 01:18:12,640
小玉也在盼望能早点到达目的地
... and she yearned for the end of the journey...

1003
01:18:12,820 --> 01:18:16,690
因为她自己清楚小孩子快出生了
... for she knew that her time was at hand.

1004
01:18:18,630 --> 01:18:23,660
此时此刻 日本鬼子漫山遍野 肆虐着这片土地
The enemy was everywhere,leaving footprints on the sick earth...

1005
01:18:23,830 --> 01:18:27,130
凌谭的乡亲们死了很多人
... and many of Ling Tan's kinsmen died.

1006
01:18:27,300 --> 01:18:31,360
有些人很快被杀死了 更惨的是另外一些人
Some met death quickly but they were the fortunate ones.

1007
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:35,810
只能等着被活活饿死冻死
For others found a longer, harder way to die.

1008
01:18:41,020 --> 01:18:44,780
闹完饥荒 瘟疫也开始肆虐
And then starvation came,and pestilence...

1009
01:18:44,950 --> 01:18:48,390
老凌一家也在劫难逃
... and did not spare the house of Ling Tan.

1010
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:53,360
谭家的孙子们也病倒了 因为他们一直体弱多病
The little children were struck down for they were the weakest.

1011
01:18:54,860 --> 01:18:57,660
老凌头夫妻两个无奈地跑到地里头
So Ling Tan and his wife went into the fields...

1012
01:18:57,830 --> 01:19:01,170
挖草根 捡谷粒
... to dig for roots and forgotten kernels of grain.

1013
01:19:01,340 --> 01:19:04,330
凌家沟到处都是饥肠辘辘的人
All about them were the other people of the valley.

1014
01:19:04,510 --> 01:19:08,410
人们饿到发疯了似的
And the hunger pain in their bellies drove some of them mad...

1015
01:19:08,580 --> 01:19:13,070
他们像禽兽一样为了一点吃的大打出手
... and they became as animals and fought each other.

1016
01:19:19,590 --> 01:19:21,720
还有些人跟乞丐似的
Some of them fell upon their knees...

1017
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:25,260
为了一些猪都不吃的泔水 而打得死去活来
... and fought for swill that not even swine would eat...

1018
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:27,090
而鬼子们却站在旁边冷笑
... while the enemy laughed.

1019
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:36,130
但是老凌头跟其他农民一样 依旧坚守着自己的土地
But still, Ling Tan and others like him clung to their land.

1020
01:19:44,650 --> 01:19:46,340
老太婆
Old woman?

1021
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:57,690
我找了点吃的
I have found food for them.

1022
01:19:57,860 --> 01:19:59,380
孙女死了
Girl is dead.

1023
01:20:09,340 --> 01:20:11,430
孙子呢 我们还有吃的 给他吃点东西
But the boy... There is food.We can help him.

1024
01:20:11,610 --> 01:20:15,010
太迟了 回天无力了
It's too late. He is past all help.

1025
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:38,360
这家里没了孙子 还能叫做家吗
What is a house where no children are?

1026
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:44,260
他们带来欢乐 如今他们一走 这家也就乐不起来了
They brought only happiness and they have taken it away.

1027
01:20:45,040 --> 01:20:47,800
老天啊 你为什么要带走他们啊
What need could the gods have of them?

1028
01:20:49,310 --> 01:20:52,440
为什么不是我这个老骨头而偏偏是我的孙子们啊
That should I go on living when my grandchildren die.

1029
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:54,880
我诅咒这些战争犯
Curse all these men who would make wars.

1030
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:57,040
我诅咒他们全家
Curse all women who give birth to these men.

1031
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:59,850
我诅咒他们祖宗十八代
And curse their grandmothers and all who are their kin.

1032
01:21:00,190 --> 01:21:02,520
为什么通情达理的人都不联合起来
Why do not men of peace and sense band together...

1033
01:21:02,690 --> 01:21:05,460
反抗这些制造战争的畜生呢
...and forbid life to those who would make wars?

1034
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:10,760
我现在该怎么办啊
Yet what can I do?

1035
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:13,630
我一个人又能如何啊
One man upon my land.

1036
01:21:17,610 --> 01:21:21,510
老表 老表在家吗
Cousin, cousin? Are you here, then?

1037
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:29,670
老表在家吗 老表 人都跑哪里去了
Cousin, are you here, then? Cousin, cousin? Where is the man?

1038
01:21:29,850 --> 01:21:31,550
我有个天大的消息告诉你啊
I come with big news in my mouth.

1039
01:21:33,090 --> 01:21:37,720
你看看 他家还有吃的呢
See. See, they have food and did not share it.

1040
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:45,500
有你儿子的信 我从茶屋带过来的
This is from your son. A messenger brought it to the teahouse.

1041
01:21:45,670 --> 01:21:48,900
我可从来没收到过我儿子写的信
A letter from a son is something I will never have now.

1042
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:51,300
我们都一无所有了
We have all lost much.

1043
01:21:51,470 --> 01:21:53,410
快快快 打开瞧瞧
Well, then, open it.

1044
01:21:58,750 --> 01:22:00,720
一根红线
The cord is red.

1045
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:04,650
- 是个孙子! - 我们又有多了个孙子!
- It is a son. - We have a grandson.

1046
01:22:04,950 --> 01:22:07,890
你哭啥啊 应该高兴才对啊
But you weep. This is a time for joy.

1047
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:10,890
高兴啥 刚刚死了两个
Two grandchildren lie dead in our house.

1048
01:22:11,060 --> 01:22:13,530
我是不是该谢谢老天爷 送回来一个给我了啊
Shall I thank heaven for sending us back but one?

1049
01:22:13,700 --> 01:22:17,130
闭嘴老太婆 如果老天听到了 说不定又多带走一个呢!
Quiet, woman, or heaven will hear you and take even him away.

1050
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:21,800
谢谢 老表 这可是天大的好消息啊
Thank you, cousin.This news lightens our heavy hearts.

1051
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:23,560
孙子可是大事啊
A grandson is no small thing.

1052
01:22:23,740 --> 01:22:26,830
按理说 小玉的孩子又不是你们的
By rights, this child of Jade's is not yours.

1053
01:22:27,010 --> 01:22:28,740
你个疯婆子乱说话
You talk with no thought.

1054
01:22:28,910 --> 01:22:31,880
别在意 老表 她最近受罪太多了
Pray excuse her. Bitterness has turned her words to gall.

1055
01:22:32,050 --> 01:22:34,240
如果小玉当初嫁给我们家儿子...
Had Jade married my son as she ought...

1056
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:37,680
我儿子也不会死
...he would be alive today and safe there with her.

1057
01:22:37,850 --> 01:22:42,480
这样一来 小玉儿子才是我们的孙子
And so before the gods,her child is our grandchild.

1058
01:22:42,660 --> 01:22:46,020
我是不是应该把你轰出去
I should drive you from my house...

1059
01:22:46,490 --> 01:22:49,160
但是我可不想坏了我的心情
...but it would soil this moment.

1060
01:22:57,570 --> 01:23:00,040
这个难得的好心情
This joyful moment.

1061
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,910
敌人们挡不住耕种的季节
But not even the enemy could stop the seasons.

1062
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:09,740
春耕到了
And at last it was spring.

1063
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:14,290
鬼子们发放种子给村民 不是让吃的 而是用来播种的
And each farmer was given grain.Not to eat, but to plant.

1064
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:16,690
每颗种子 都是数过的
And it was said that each seed was counted...

1065
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:20,850
如果种子没长 都要被追究
... and the man would answer for it if each seed did not yield.

1066
01:23:21,030 --> 01:23:24,970
老凌头只能像牛一样 背起缰绳开始犁地
So Ling Tan harnessed himself to his plow like an ox.

1067
01:23:25,130 --> 01:23:30,900
他跟老婆子一起 累到晕头转向的 分不清天地
And together, he and his old woman felt the earth turn beneath their feet.

1068
01:23:41,320 --> 01:23:43,380
虽然谷子长得又高又长
The grain grew straight and tall.

1069
01:23:43,550 --> 01:23:47,180
但是凌谭两口子没法像往常一样 高兴起来 ...
But Ling Tan and his wife could no longer take pleasure in it's promise...

1070
01:23:47,360 --> 01:23:52,020
他们知道 收成都不归他们自己的
... for they knew that what they worked for would not be theirs.

1071
01:23:55,160 --> 01:23:58,460
老婆子啊 你还没嫌鬼子们家里翻得底朝天啊
Now what, old woman? Has the enemy not done enough damage to my house?

1072
01:23:58,630 --> 01:24:00,100
你咋就有开始挖地洞了啊
Must you dig up the foundations?

1073
01:24:00,270 --> 01:24:02,790
我们必须把种子跟蔬菜藏起来啊
We will keep our seed and the vegetables we grow...

1074
01:24:02,970 --> 01:24:04,340
放在这个洞里面
...and hide them in this hole.

1075
01:24:04,510 --> 01:24:07,030
- 我都把洞挖的跟一头猪那么大了  - 啥猪
- I will make it big enough to hold a pig. - What pig?

1076
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:10,210
你从鬼子那里偷的那头
The one you'll steal from the enemy's breeding farm.

1077
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:12,040
那自然要更大一点啊
But it will have to be big.

1078
01:24:12,210 --> 01:24:15,380
您自己一个人怎么挖洞呢 这地太硬了
How can you dig such a thing without help. The earth is stubborn.

1079
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:18,210
老天给我的点子 老天也会找个人来帮我的吧
Heaven gave me the thought. Heaven will provide the help.

1080
01:24:18,390 --> 01:24:19,880
铲子在那边
The shovel is there.

1081
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:23,050
我们还得瞒着鬼子从自己的地里头偷点吃的
We will steal food from ourselves and eat it.

1082
01:24:23,390 --> 01:24:27,760
我刚听到你这么说的时候 还吓了一跳呢
I am too just a man to deny sense even to a woman, when I hear it from her.

1083
01:24:27,930 --> 01:24:31,390
要是所有人都这么干 鬼子们迟早变成狗尾巴上的跳蚤
If all do this, we'll harry the enemy like fleas in a dog's tail.

1084
01:24:31,570 --> 01:24:36,060
对对对 说不定他们还会停下来舔舔自己的狗屁股呢
And it may be that he will make little headway for stopping to gnaw at his rear.

1085
01:24:53,550 --> 01:24:56,490
- 爹  - 儿子
- My son. - My father.

1086
01:24:57,860 --> 01:25:00,050
真高兴见到你们
Oh, what gladness.

1087
01:25:00,230 --> 01:25:01,960
娘
My mother.

1088
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:06,960
我孙子呢 他在哪 他在哪
Have I no grandson? Where is he? Where is he?

1089
01:25:07,140 --> 01:25:10,470
安静点 老太婆 你都没叫 鬼子们就能听到啦
Quiet, woman. Before you burst, and the enemy hears the sound you make.

1090
01:25:10,640 --> 01:25:12,400
你把我的乖孙子放哪里了
Where have you left my little dumpling?

1091
01:25:12,570 --> 01:25:15,130
又是书啊 书的 你会把我孙子压坏的
Books, still books. You've crushed him beneath them.

1092
01:25:15,310 --> 01:25:17,970
你爱书都胜过你自己儿子了
You seem to love them more than you love your child.

1093
01:25:40,940 --> 01:25:43,930
他闻起来真香
How sweet his flesh smells.

1094
01:25:45,740 --> 01:25:48,070
把灯挪近一点 我仔细瞧瞧
Bring the lamp close so I can see him.

1095
01:25:48,240 --> 01:25:51,470
我的乖孙子啊
Oh, my little meat dumpling.

1096
01:25:51,650 --> 01:25:56,020
看看这身板子 这头发 跟黑缎子一样
Oh, how firm he is of body, and his hair like black silk.

1097
01:25:56,180 --> 01:25:58,180
就跟我当初想的一模一样啊
He's exactly as I thought he would be.

1098
01:25:58,350 --> 01:26:01,080
我就知道你们会把孙子带回来给我看看的
I knew you'd bring him back to me. I knew. I knew.

1099
01:26:01,260 --> 01:26:03,660
不然我怎么活下去啊
Else I could not have lived.

1100
01:26:03,830 --> 01:26:07,780
每天每夜 我都在想着我的乖孙子啊
Night after night,I've dreamed of holding him like this.

1101
01:26:07,960 --> 01:26:10,190
悠着点 老太婆 悠着点
Guard you heart, old woman. Guard your heart.

1102
01:26:10,360 --> 01:26:13,090
是啊娘 别高兴过头了啊
Yes, my mother, too much joy is as bad as too much sorrow.

1103
01:26:13,270 --> 01:26:16,930
来 娘 喝茶 这样好说话
Here, my mother, drink down this cold tea.Then the words can come out.

1104
01:26:19,070 --> 01:26:24,380
你看 这可不是一般人的小孩啊 这脸 多方正啊
Why, this is no usual child.Look at his face, how square it is.

1105
01:26:24,550 --> 01:26:26,950
嘴巴也方正
And he has a square mouth.

1106
01:26:27,110 --> 01:26:30,480
- 来来来 把孙子还给我  - 你等会 老太婆 再等会
- Now give him back to me. - In a moment, old woman. In a moment.

1107
01:26:32,950 --> 01:26:36,120
我们这样过日子 鬼子能拿我们怎么样啊
What can the enemy do to us when our family goes on like this?

1108
01:26:36,290 --> 01:26:40,420
孙子回家咯 来来来吃点东西啊
There, now.You are in your home and you must eat.

1109
01:26:43,260 --> 01:26:45,260
娘 你等一下别急
I beg you not be angry with me, Mother...

1110
01:26:45,430 --> 01:26:48,030
但是你不要把嘴里的东西给小孩子吃
...but do not put food from your mouth into the child's.

1111
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:50,470
我也是这么喂孩子的 没事的
Well, I fed my own son so. It did him no harm.

1112
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:54,570
不是啦 现在不好 我带了一本育儿的书
But it is not thought good now. I bought a book and it told how to care for children.

1113
01:26:54,740 --> 01:26:58,110
- 书里说这样做是不对的 - 你这么一说 那你还是把孩子抱回去
- And it spoke against such things. - Why, you better take your child back.

1114
01:26:58,280 --> 01:27:02,480
- 我抱着他 他就给弄脏啦 - 娘 我只是为了把孙子带给你瞧瞧
- Doubtless, I pollute him when I hold him. - Mother, it was for you I brought him home.

1115
01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:06,250
别斗嘴了你们俩 今晚是个开心的日子啊
Cool your anger, both of you.Should we quarrel this night, of all nights...

1116
01:27:06,420 --> 01:27:08,890
他才是我们今晚的甜心啊
...and over the child who is the center of our hearts?

1117
01:27:09,060 --> 01:27:11,120
我养儿子的时候哪里看过什么书啊
Did I ever have a book to feed my children?

1118
01:27:11,290 --> 01:27:13,420
也没见我弄丢过儿子啊
Did I ever lose a son?

1119
01:27:13,590 --> 01:27:17,590
随她怎么做啦 她开心就行拉
Indulge her with the child. It will heal her for everything.

1120
01:27:22,970 --> 01:27:25,960
我们家有变得有生机了 老头子
Our house has come alive again, old man.

1121
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:35,550
- 早上好 伙计  - 早上好
- Good day, friends. - Good day.

1122
01:27:35,720 --> 01:27:39,210
我儿子带来了指挥部的通知
My son comes from the free land. He has a message from the high command.

1123
01:27:39,390 --> 01:27:42,450
村子里到处都有像我一样的游击队员
There are many like me and we spread among the villagers...

1124
01:27:42,620 --> 01:27:45,320
告诉大伙应该怎么反抗敌人
...to tell such men as you what we must do.

1125
01:27:45,490 --> 01:27:47,220
我们必须打倒敌人
This enemy must be resisted.

1126
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:51,390
解放区是公开的事情 而在占领区却是进行地下行动
Openly where the land is free and secretly where the land is lost.

1127
01:27:51,570 --> 01:27:54,800
我们必须秘密地进行斗争 比其他人还要任重道远
We, who must resist secretly, have a harder task than the others.

1128
01:27:54,970 --> 01:27:57,600
我们必须团结一致 一致对外
We must work togetheras the fingers on one hand.

1129
01:27:57,770 --> 01:28:00,330
我们必须监视敌人的行动 然后逐个击破
We must track down this enemy and kill him.

1130
01:28:00,510 --> 01:28:02,100
那我们应该这么做...
What we should do is this...

1131
01:28:02,280 --> 01:28:05,300
加入游击队 你这是要我们去送死啊
Join with the hill men? You're inviting us to die.

1132
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:08,240
是的 死的像条汉子 而不是砧板上的猪头
Yes, but to die like men, not sheep on the butchering block.

1133
01:28:08,420 --> 01:28:09,780
你不要责备表叔啊
You must not blame our cousin.

1134
01:28:09,950 --> 01:28:12,320
读书人都是这样子畏手畏脚的
A scholar can never be as brave as one unlettered.

1135
01:28:12,490 --> 01:28:15,650
我们必须在爹的房子里面挖一个洞做暗室
We must build the hole under my father's house into one strong room.

1136
01:28:15,820 --> 01:28:18,550
好让游击队的同志躲在里面
And there we will hide the men that must be hidden.

1137
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:25,760
你们哪里找的枪 上面还有洋文呢
Where did you find these guns? Some have foreign writing on them.

1138
01:28:25,930 --> 01:28:29,490
聪明的人都不问太多问题的
A wise man does not question a gift too closely.

1139
01:28:45,090 --> 01:28:47,080
我现在得去站岗了
I will take the guard now.

1140
01:28:47,250 --> 01:28:49,650
先吃点东西先 我还不累
No, eat first. I am not weary.

1141
01:28:52,130 --> 01:28:54,820
有个乡亲想知道我们怎么弄到枪的
One of our kinsmen wants to know where you found the guns.

1142
01:28:55,000 --> 01:28:59,330
你就说很容易弄到手的 只要用刀捅到鬼子肚子里面 就抢到了
Tell him they are easiest found by sticking a knife into the belly of an enemy soldier:

1143
01:29:00,700 --> 01:29:04,190
这枪给你 刚从鬼子的肚子里头拿出来的
And there is the gun for you, as if from his insides.

1144
01:29:05,410 --> 01:29:08,240
儿子们
My sons, all my sons.

1145
01:29:08,410 --> 01:29:10,400
我一个女人家能插什么话呢
What more can I ask, who am only a woman?

1146
01:29:10,580 --> 01:29:13,950
听听老三说的 看来他喜欢杀鬼子了
To hear our third son speak, one would think he'd like to kill.

1147
01:29:14,180 --> 01:29:15,410
不不不 你看看他 没事
Oh, how well he looks.

1148
01:29:15,580 --> 01:29:17,710
这些事情都跟我无关 我只负责做饭
And not on my cooking. I do not understand it.

1149
01:29:17,890 --> 01:29:20,220
娘 你要知道 现在好多女孩子仰慕老三呢
Oh, you should see the women admire him now.

1150
01:29:20,390 --> 01:29:22,910
- 不过呢 他都看不上眼   - 女人啊
- And still he has yet to choose one.- Women.

1151
01:29:23,090 --> 01:29:24,750
别自以为是
Do not turn your nose toward heaven.

1152
01:29:24,930 --> 01:29:27,790
你也是时候带个儿媳妇回家了 你多留心点
It's time you brought home a daughter-in-law. See that you do.

1153
01:29:27,960 --> 01:29:31,190
没有女人照料 我们会变成什么啊
What would become of us if we did not have the women to keep at us?

1154
01:29:31,370 --> 01:29:33,530
没有女人 也就没有你们这几个龟儿子
If you had no women,none of you would be born.

1155
01:29:33,700 --> 01:29:35,330
我死之前还想多抱一个孙子呢
I want grandsons before I die.

1156
01:29:35,500 --> 01:29:37,900
让吴连胖子去给你生一个去
Let fat men like Wu Lien bother with such nonsense.

1157
01:29:38,070 --> 01:29:40,600
我要专心打仗 这就是我现在想做的
I'm lean enough to fight. That is what I'm going to do.

1158
01:29:40,780 --> 01:29:43,140
我想知道 吴连现在如何了
I wanted to ask, what news of Wu Lien?

1159
01:29:43,310 --> 01:29:46,180
他全家都呆在城里受到鬼子保护 我是这么听说的
He and his family live in the city and are protected, I heard.

1160
01:29:46,350 --> 01:29:49,540
是的我也听说了 但是没听他们亲口告诉我们过
Yes, we have heard, but they haven't come to tell us so themselves.

1161
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:51,910
吴连现在连他娘的坟墓都不敢来祭拜
Nor has Wu Lien been here to his mother's grave.

1162
01:29:52,090 --> 01:29:54,650
我也听说过这些人的事情
I have known of others who are protected.

1163
01:29:55,190 --> 01:29:57,380
难道他做了鬼子的走狗了
Could this mean he deals with the enemy?

1164
01:29:57,560 --> 01:30:00,320
- 我不相信 除非我真的见到了  - 我也不相信
- I will not believe that until I know it is so.- Nor will I.

1165
01:30:00,490 --> 01:30:02,490
有人来了
Someone comes.

1166
01:30:02,660 --> 01:30:05,130
是老沈 站岗的
It is Neighbor Shen, the lookout.

1167
01:30:06,700 --> 01:30:08,690
鬼子进村了
Enemy soldiers are in the village.

1168
01:30:08,870 --> 01:30:11,200
他们来抓壮丁了
They look for young men to slave for them.

1169
01:30:11,370 --> 01:30:13,700
好啊 我们来会会这些抓壮丁的鬼子们
Well, then, let us help them find what they seek.

1170
01:30:13,870 --> 01:30:17,540
- 来了多少鬼子  - 一整排 从这儿到村口那么多
- How many of the enemy? - A line from here to the door.

1171
01:30:21,680 --> 01:30:23,670
乡亲们 操家伙了
Kinsman, come out and bring enough guns...

1172
01:30:23,850 --> 01:30:25,840
大伙一起并肩作战
...for the others who will act with us.

1173
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,000
这才刚刚开始呢
This is the beginning of it, then.

1174
01:30:52,250 --> 01:30:55,840
- 你能照顾好自己吗 - 不怕 让罗圈腿的鬼子们来吧
- You will be safe? - Let them come, the bandy-legs.

1175
01:31:04,430 --> 01:31:05,890
滚进车里
Get into the cart.

1176
01:31:06,060 --> 01:31:08,090
这些中国猪不会打仗的
These Chinese pigs do not fight.

1177
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:10,860
他们生下来就是奴隶
They were born to be slaves.

1178
01:31:11,630 --> 01:31:13,860
不过这个蛮壮的
But this one is strong.

1179
01:31:14,030 --> 01:31:16,660
是啊 一头强壮的猪好干活
Yes, a good work animal.

1180
01:31:17,300 --> 01:31:21,070
这个送去挖矿更好 今晚收获不错啊
This one will be sent to the mine. We made a good catch tonight.

1181
01:31:21,880 --> 01:31:24,500
小菜一碟啊
This is almost too easy.

1182
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:26,940
把其他人带上车
Bring the rest to the cart.

1183
01:31:27,110 --> 01:31:29,480
这些人都是我要找的
They're the ones I found.

1184
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:32,140
全他妈的是干活的牲口
We need more work animals like this.

1185
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,720
再搜搜那些房子
Search the houses again.

1186
01:31:34,690 --> 01:31:37,050
估计还有些躲起来了
Some of them are still hiding.

1187
01:31:37,220 --> 01:31:39,190
谁反抗就毙了谁
Shoot any that resist.

1188
01:31:39,360 --> 01:31:42,520
我们得教教他们如何效忠天皇陛下
We must teach them that it is an honor to serve the emperor.

1189
01:32:08,460 --> 01:32:10,360
- 拦住他! - 抓住他!
- Stop him. - Catch him.

1190
01:32:10,520 --> 01:32:13,290
如果他跑了 我们的计划就暴露了 他会带更多鬼子来杀我们
If he escapes, we are lost. He will bring others to kill us.

1191
01:32:22,470 --> 01:32:25,100
- 别开枪 别开枪  - 别怕 鬼子
- Don't shoot. Don't shoot. - Do not be afraid.

1192
01:32:25,270 --> 01:32:28,400
我不开枪 我他妈捅死你
I am not going to shoot you.

1193
01:32:47,960 --> 01:32:51,130
- 睡觉吧 老头子  - 还是说你要站着睡
- Come to bed, old man. - Or have you learned to sleep standing up?

1194
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:53,460
小玉不是读过一本书
The name of the book that Jade once read...

1195
01:32:53,630 --> 01:32:56,160
叫 我们都是兄弟姐妹 吗
...was it not All Men Are Brothers?

1196
01:32:56,340 --> 01:32:58,970
是啊 这本书把你吵得睡不着吗
It was. But is that something to steal your rest?

1197
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:00,970
不是不是
This is what troubles me.

1198
01:33:01,140 --> 01:33:06,340
小玉跟老二怎么能这样杀人呢 如果所有人都是兄弟姐妹的话
How can Jade send forth her husband to kill other men if all men are his brothers?

1199
01:33:06,510 --> 01:33:10,210
可能是因为那些鬼子都不是人 而是禽兽
Perhaps because the bandy-legs are no longer men but beasts.

1200
01:33:10,380 --> 01:33:12,680
但是我们会不会也变成杀人的畜生呢
But must we, too, become as beasts?

1201
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:17,210
今晚我看到人们用不同的方式杀人
Tonight, I learned that men kill differently.

1202
01:33:17,390 --> 01:33:20,620
我看到老三把刀子通到鬼子肚子里头
I saw our third son with his knife and...

1203
01:33:21,360 --> 01:33:22,800
他回到家里
He came back into this house...

1204
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:26,460
用沾满鲜血的手抓东西吃
...and picked up food and ate it
with the blood still upon his hands.

1205
01:33:26,630 --> 01:33:28,260
我觉得那样不对
I say that is wrong.

1206
01:33:28,440 --> 01:33:31,030
但是鬼子还在呢 我们要不杀他们 要不被他们杀
Yet the enemy is upon us. We must kill them or be killed.

1207
01:33:31,210 --> 01:33:36,300
但是有件事情我们要记住 说不定我们的人也会自相残杀的
But there is one thing we must remember, old woman, or we have killed ourselves too.

1208
01:33:38,410 --> 01:33:40,510
和平才是对的
Peace is good.

1209
01:33:40,810 --> 01:33:42,710
年轻人可能都忘了
The young cannot remember it.

1210
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:44,440
但是我们都记得
And it is we who must remember...

1211
01:33:44,620 --> 01:33:48,580
应该让儿孙们知道 和平才是最好的精神食粮
...and teach them again that peace is man's great food.

1212
01:34:23,790 --> 01:34:26,730
你要是再生多一个儿子的话 你就不用自己动手了
If you had two sons,there would be no work done.

1213
01:34:38,310 --> 01:34:40,270
有人来了
Someone comes.

1214
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:50,570
是你们家大姐
It is only your elder sister.

1215
01:34:50,990 --> 01:34:54,510
- 别告诉别人我们来过 娘  - 我们进去屋里头藏起来
- Do not tell them we are here, Mother. - We will go to the hidden room.

1216
01:34:56,420 --> 01:34:59,620
这年头 真是怪事啊连姐弟都不能相见
This is a strange day when brothers and sisters hide from each other.

1217
01:34:59,790 --> 01:35:02,090
现在每天都有怪事发生
All days are strange now.

1218
01:35:06,230 --> 01:35:07,930
有鬼子
Soldiers.

1219
01:35:12,570 --> 01:35:14,560
好像很有钱的样子
They look rich.

1220
01:35:14,780 --> 01:35:16,870
鬼子都这么肥头大耳吗
Were they always so fat?

1221
01:35:17,080 --> 01:35:20,880
可能我们看习惯了皮包骨头的人了吧
Perhaps our eyes have grown used to people afraid and hungry.

1222
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:29,720
长辈们 我们来看你们了
My old ones, here we are to see you.

1223
01:35:29,890 --> 01:35:31,480
真是万幸啊
A thousand fortunes.

1224
01:35:31,660 --> 01:35:34,060
我想你们过的挺好的嘛
I trust you are well.

1225
01:35:36,500 --> 01:35:39,160
欢迎我们进去屋里坐一坐吗
Are we then welcome to come within?

1226
01:35:39,330 --> 01:35:41,560
你们全家都是受欢迎的
You and your family are welcome.

1227
01:35:41,870 --> 01:35:44,700
不过其他人我就不欢迎了
But I cannot let others into my house.

1228
01:35:45,210 --> 01:35:48,300
别担心 这些只是我的守卫
You need not fear.
These two only came to guard me.

1229
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,910
在我家 不用守卫
What guard do you need in my house?

1230
01:35:51,780 --> 01:35:54,010
我家老丈人比较胆小
My father-in-law is old and afraid.

1231
01:35:54,180 --> 01:35:56,580
我不胆小 但是我就是不想让他们进来
I'm not afraid. But I will not have them in my house.

1232
01:35:56,750 --> 01:35:59,980
那我就只能在外头守着了
Then I must wait here with the guards.

1233
01:36:01,160 --> 01:36:05,110
- 你能给几个凳子坐吗 爹  - 可以
- Will you bring stools to sit upon? - I will.

1234
01:36:06,990 --> 01:36:10,620
乡巴佬 真粗鲁
Country people, they have no manners.

1235
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:14,170
我弟弟们呢
Where, then, are my brothers?

1236
01:36:14,330 --> 01:36:16,630
他们都逃难去了 就剩下我们俩了
They are gone, and we are alone.

1237
01:36:16,800 --> 01:36:19,570
你大哥的孩子也死了
Even your elder brother's children are dead.

1238
01:36:19,740 --> 01:36:22,300
不是饿死就是病死
They died of sickness and starvation.

1239
01:36:22,480 --> 01:36:23,770
世道不好啊
It is the times.

1240
01:36:23,940 --> 01:36:27,940
我替我大哥感到难过 你也节哀啊 娘 我也担心你
I grieve for my elder brother and for you also. I weep for you.

1241
01:36:28,120 --> 01:36:31,880
别多心了 我眼泪早就流干了
Do not waste your tears. My own have dried.

1242
01:36:35,020 --> 01:36:36,350
你为什么这么倔
Why are you so stiff?

1243
01:36:36,520 --> 01:36:39,120
你要知道 我做的一切可都是精打细算啊
You must know that what I do is done only for the best.

1244
01:36:39,290 --> 01:36:40,850
我哪里知道你都干了些什么呢
I do not know what you do.

1245
01:36:41,030 --> 01:36:44,360
识时务者为俊杰啊 机会是给有准备的人啊
Times are times, and the wise man takes his time as he finds it.

1246
01:36:44,530 --> 01:36:46,730
有时候 妥协比勇敢要实用很多
Compromise is sometimes better than valor.

1247
01:36:46,900 --> 01:36:48,660
你们现在住在哪里
Where do you live now?

1248
01:36:49,670 --> 01:36:51,870
北门街10号
At the 10th house of the North Gate Street.

1249
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:55,200
那可是有钱人的房子啊 你们怎么住进去的
That is a street of fine houses. How can you live there?

1250
01:36:55,580 --> 01:36:58,200
我是被请过去的 我替新政府工作的
I am told to live there.I work for the new government.

1251
01:36:58,380 --> 01:37:00,610
待遇又好 我也高兴
I'm well-paid and I'm content.

1252
01:37:00,780 --> 01:37:02,750
你明白我的意思吗 岳父
You see what I would say, my father-in-law?

1253
01:37:02,920 --> 01:37:04,580
我是个粗人 听不懂
I am a common man. I am so stupid...

1254
01:37:04,750 --> 01:37:08,310
我只听得懂人话 从人嘴巴里面说出来的
...I understand only a thing when it is said to me, and when I hear it.

1255
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:10,690
我今天可是来帮你的 岳父
I come here today to help you.

1256
01:37:10,860 --> 01:37:13,350
如果你按我说的做 你的日子会好过很多的
If you do as I say, your life will be easier.

1257
01:37:13,530 --> 01:37:16,760
- 那我应该做些什么呢  - 按我吩咐的去做就可以了
- What must I do? - Do whatever is told you to do.

1258
01:37:16,930 --> 01:37:19,760
我会随时联络你
And I will manage for you here and there as I'm able.

1259
01:37:19,930 --> 01:37:21,400
你现在又都做些什么事情呢 女婿
What had you to do, son-in-law?

1260
01:37:21,570 --> 01:37:24,040
只有一件事 我负责帮皇军进货
For one thing, I'm a controller of all incoming goods.

1261
01:37:24,200 --> 01:37:26,760
大米啊 小麦啊 鱼啊 鸦片啊 盐啊什么的...
Rice and wheat, fish, opium, salt...

1262
01:37:26,940 --> 01:37:30,810
鸦片 鸦片 那鬼东西害得多少中国人生不如死你知道吗
Opium? Opium? That evil was driven from our country by great pain and suffering.

1263
01:37:30,980 --> 01:37:34,740
- 你现在还敢把它弄回来卖  - 我自己也做不了主啊
- And now you bring it back. - But I'm not my own master.

1264
01:37:38,090 --> 01:37:40,380
你们怎么这么铁石心肠啊
How can you be so hard?

1265
01:37:40,550 --> 01:37:44,220
毕竟家里就剩下你们两口子了
After all, there are only you two old people left.

1266
01:37:44,390 --> 01:37:46,520
- 我们现在就是你们唯一的亲人了  - 别瞎操心 我们死不了
- And we are all you have. - We can live.

1267
01:37:46,690 --> 01:37:50,690
我们最好走吧 这里容不下我们
You do well to leave. We are not wanted here.

1268
01:38:04,180 --> 01:38:06,150
看来我们儿子的担心是对的
What our son feared was true.

1269
01:38:06,310 --> 01:38:08,440
诅咒这帮狗东西
Curse this enemy.

1270
01:38:08,620 --> 01:38:11,850
害得我跟我女儿吵架了
He has made me quarrel with my daughter.

1271
01:38:16,590 --> 01:38:21,530
瞧瞧 吴连那家人现在好吃好穿 还有鬼子帮
See? Silk coats and enemy soldiers to serve him.

1272
01:38:22,300 --> 01:38:26,630
看样子吴连捞了很大一笔油水啊
It is plain Wu Lien has got his fingers into the fat.

1273
01:38:29,100 --> 01:38:33,870
有钱又如何 你又不去巴结他
Of what value is a rich relative unless you can put him to use?

1274
01:38:43,950 --> 01:38:46,250
我们是吴连的亲戚 想见见吴连
We are his kinsmen and would see Wu Lien.

1275
01:38:46,420 --> 01:38:49,410
进去吧 吴连欢迎你们
Go in. Wu Lien sees anybody.

1276
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:03,330
请问吴连的房间在哪里
Where are the rooms of Wu Lien, our rich relative?

1277
01:39:03,500 --> 01:39:05,130
那里
In there.

1278
01:39:09,080 --> 01:39:12,840
还有什么比亲戚拜访更让人开心的事情么
What greater pleasure is there than a short visit from relatives?

1279
01:39:13,010 --> 01:39:16,970
来就来嘛 不用带什么鱼啊什么的 留着自己吃就是啊
But next time, eat the fish. Do not bring it to us.

1280
01:39:17,150 --> 01:39:20,280
吴连 你真是个大好人
Wu Lien, you're a kind, good man.

1281
01:39:20,450 --> 01:39:23,950
你就不能给我们家糟老头
Can you not find my old man a worthless little piece of work...

1282
01:39:24,120 --> 01:39:26,350
在这个大房子里面安排个小差事吗
...here in these walls to pay us something?

1283
01:39:26,530 --> 01:39:30,220
我岳父应该不会赞成他过来这边吧
But will my father-in-law let him come here?

1284
01:39:30,400 --> 01:39:33,590
我老公不用他管 再怎么说
My husband by right should have more power than your father-in-law...

1285
01:39:33,770 --> 01:39:36,900
他辈分更高 更有权力
...because he is older. And it is time he took that power.

1286
01:39:37,070 --> 01:39:39,560
你也这样认为吗 表叔
Do you think the same way, elder cousin?

1287
01:39:39,740 --> 01:39:43,440
- 我老公跟我是想到一块的   - 然后呢
- My husband always thinks as I do. - And how's that?

1288
01:39:43,610 --> 01:39:48,070
我觉得我们得为了自己
I think we must save ourselves at all cost...

1289
01:39:48,250 --> 01:39:49,940
为了自己的将来着想
...and bow before what is upon us...

1290
01:39:50,120 --> 01:39:52,810
好好计划一下
...and do what we can to make something of it.

1291
01:39:54,590 --> 01:39:57,990
也是 不过你们呆在村子里面会更好一点
Yes, perhaps you will be more content to remain in the village...

1292
01:39:58,160 --> 01:40:00,750
那里毕竟有更多你们认识的人
...where you are known and know everybody.

1293
01:40:00,930 --> 01:40:04,090
不过这里也时刻欢迎你们 我们会给你们吃的 还有钱
But you are welcome to visit us here. We'll give you food, money.

1294
01:40:04,260 --> 01:40:07,200
不过你们得给我一些情报
And then you can give us the news.

1295
01:40:07,400 --> 01:40:10,230
我们知道的很少的 小村子那有什么情报啊
We have very little to tell. Nothing happens in our village.

1296
01:40:10,400 --> 01:40:13,100
吴连啊 最近村子里面发生很多事情
Much has happened and more will. Wu Lien.

1297
01:40:13,270 --> 01:40:17,140
我老头子跟我都愿意当你的耳目
My old man and I will be as one eye and one ear.

1298
01:40:17,310 --> 01:40:21,680
我们的所见所闻 都会通通告诉你
And all that we see and hear, you shall see and hear also.

1299
01:40:21,850 --> 01:40:26,480
我们一直很想知道你们在做些什么 还有我的岳父岳母
We always like to hear how you do, and my wife's father and mother.

1300
01:40:26,650 --> 01:40:29,020
- 还有他们的几个儿子 - 当然当然
- And her brothers also? - Of course, of course.

1301
01:40:29,190 --> 01:40:30,820
他们也是我们亲戚
They are also our kin.

1302
01:40:30,990 --> 01:40:34,550
但是他们走了之后 好像就没什么消息了
But since they are away,there must be little news of them.

1303
01:40:34,730 --> 01:40:37,750
是的是的 他们去了解放区 没在家
True, true, they're all in the free land and not at home.

1304
01:40:37,930 --> 01:40:40,330
难道我看到的小玉跟她的胖儿子是在梦里看见的
Then perhaps I saw Jade and her fat child in a dream.

1305
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:42,760
小玉有儿子了
Oh, Jade has a child, then?

1306
01:40:42,940 --> 01:40:45,460
是的是的 信里面说的
Yes, yes, the news came in a letter from the free land.

1307
01:40:45,640 --> 01:40:49,910
- 我们也没看到过  - 小玉的胖儿子长得可好呢
- But we've not seen the child. - Child is a fine boy. Too fine.

1308
01:40:50,080 --> 01:40:53,770
那胖娃儿命硬 每次我看到他的时候...
Death sits on his eyebrows, I say,whenever I look at him...

1309
01:40:53,950 --> 01:40:55,280
我都看到过好几次呢
...which is often.

1310
01:40:59,420 --> 01:41:02,790
你这里环境不错啊 表亲 你的差事一定很不错
You live well here, cousin.Your position must be good.

1311
01:41:03,360 --> 01:41:06,420
表面风光 里头又是另外一回事
It is smooth on the top but under it is another thing.

1312
01:41:06,590 --> 01:41:11,330
皇军最近很不好伺候 说不定会把我们给撤了
Our conquerors feel a rising anger that may engulf us all.

1313
01:41:11,500 --> 01:41:12,730
为什么会这样
How then?

1314
01:41:12,900 --> 01:41:16,100
许多士兵从城市里面运来食物跟货物
Too many soldiers have gone forth from the city for food and goods...

1315
01:41:16,270 --> 01:41:17,630
但是都有去无返回
...and have not returned.

1316
01:41:18,040 --> 01:41:20,470
连尸首都找不到
Not even their bodies have been found.

1317
01:41:20,640 --> 01:41:23,840
太莫名其妙了 这样下去的话会毁掉我们大家的饭碗的
It is a great mystery, and one that may destroy all of us.

1318
01:41:24,540 --> 01:41:26,570
甚至牵连你们这些无辜的人
Even the innocent.

1319
01:41:26,750 --> 01:41:31,080
现在我必须向你坦白
Now, now, I will speak and fully.

1320
01:41:31,350 --> 01:41:34,580
鬼子们看样子已经知道村子里面杀人的事情了
The enemy is sure to find out that the killing started in our village.

1321
01:41:34,760 --> 01:41:36,420
这样我们也自身难保
Then what will our lives be worth?

1322
01:41:36,590 --> 01:41:39,820
吴连 这事情跟我们没关系 是老凌家干的
Wu Lien, we had nothing to do with it. It is Ling Tan.

1323
01:41:39,990 --> 01:41:43,330
凌谭跟他的儿子们 他们全都回来了 还跟游击队一起
Ling Tan and his sons. They are all returned and work with the hill men.

1324
01:41:43,500 --> 01:41:47,260
- 我亲眼看到过他们 他们都是头目  - 这女人都瞎了 疯掉了
- I've seen them and they are the leaders. - The woman's blind as a mole and crazy.

1325
01:41:47,430 --> 01:41:50,460
就算瞎了,也知道敌人被杀死然后埋在了...
Not too blind to see enemy dead piled in the streets and buried...

1326
01:41:50,640 --> 01:41:53,830
老凌家的暗室里面 那里还有许多枪支跟游击队呢
...in the hidden room beneath Ling Tan's house where men and guns are.

1327
01:41:54,010 --> 01:41:57,530
虽然 有些年轻人死了 我儿子就是其中过一个
Yes, other young men have died, my son among them.

1328
01:41:57,710 --> 01:42:00,180
但是偏偏不是老凌家的儿子
But not the sons of Ling Tan.

1329
01:42:00,350 --> 01:42:04,180
而且 他们现在还在得意的大吹大擂
No, they still spit and stride about and boast.

1330
01:42:04,350 --> 01:42:07,380
娘们 你怎么能这样诬陷老凌一家呢
Woman, how can you utter such lies against Ling Tan?

1331
01:42:07,550 --> 01:42:09,550
他们家对我们一向很好 一直救济我们啊
He has been good to us. He has fed us often.

1332
01:42:09,720 --> 01:42:11,490
- 你怎么能忘记这些呢  - 我全他妈忘记了
- Can you forget this? - I can forget it.

1333
01:42:11,660 --> 01:42:14,860
就他那点小恩小惠 就以为了不起
He likes to give us small gifts. It makes him bigger in his own eyes.

1334
01:42:15,030 --> 01:42:18,460
- 我们还要感恩戴德吗  - 我没看出来他这么说过啊
- Shall we thank him for his own pride? - I'm not concerned with his pride.

1335
01:42:18,630 --> 01:42:22,160
- 我自己还有点自尊  - 你是有一堆自尊 我看着呢
- I'd rather have some of my own. - And you shall have. I will see to it.

1336
01:42:22,340 --> 01:42:24,860
只有当你有的吃有的穿
When you wear a silk coat over a full round belly...

1337
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:27,170
你才有那么一点点的自尊
...you will have pride in yourself then.

1338
01:42:27,340 --> 01:42:30,640
你口口声声的自尊跟我所说的
What use to speak to you of pride when we use the same word...

1339
01:42:30,810 --> 01:42:32,610
是同一个意思吗
...but mean different things by it?

1340
01:42:32,780 --> 01:42:35,750
你真他妈的不是一个男人
Of all men on earth, you are least like a man.

1341
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:40,510
- 别担心那老头  - 好的
- Do not worry about that one. - Yes.

1342
01:42:40,690 --> 01:42:43,520
他会听我的话的 放心
He will follow me, or answer to me.

1343
01:42:43,690 --> 01:42:46,420
我们随时欢迎你 我的亲戚
We will always be glad to see you, kinswoman.

1344
01:42:46,590 --> 01:42:51,430
改天我们再聊 找一个安静的地方我们好好聊聊就是
Another time? Another quiet little talk such as this one has been.

1345
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:55,060
好的好的 我会给你好消息的
Yes. Yes, as soon as we have fresh news.

1346
01:42:58,170 --> 01:43:02,340
我爹全家看起来走了一条万劫不复的路
My poor father and his household walk on a rope above a pit.

1347
01:43:02,840 --> 01:43:05,710
我已经忘记刚刚表婶说的事情了
I have forgotten the things we have heard.

1348
01:43:05,880 --> 01:43:07,870
你呢 老公
Have you, my husband?

1349
01:43:08,050 --> 01:43:11,540
我可不这么认为 我记得很清楚呢
No, I have a mind that lets go of nothing.

1350
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:14,190
佐藤上尉找你
Captain Sato calls for you.

1351
01:43:14,350 --> 01:43:18,520
- 他吩咐带上你手头的工作 - 好的好的 马上马上
- He says, bring the work you have finished. - Oh, yes, yes. Yes, at once.

1352
01:43:25,000 --> 01:43:27,330
中国人欢迎他们的好邻居
The Chinese people welcome their good neighbor...

1353
01:43:27,500 --> 01:43:30,730
给他们吃的 保护他们
...who gives them food, peace and safety.

1354
01:43:31,370 --> 01:43:33,130
- 做的不错嘛  - 谢谢夸奖
- It is a clever work. - Thank you.

1355
01:43:33,310 --> 01:43:37,270
说不定这事儿可以帮我们避免一些无谓的伤亡呢
And perhaps it will help us to put an end to all these killings.

1356
01:43:43,820 --> 01:43:47,080
我会去四处转帖这些海报的
I will put the poster in all the usual places.

1357
01:43:49,320 --> 01:43:51,020
中国佬!
Chinaman!

1358
01:43:54,160 --> 01:43:55,860
过来
Come here.

1359
01:43:57,760 --> 01:44:00,260
我不是派你去收集...
Did I not instruct you to obtain information for me...

1360
01:44:00,430 --> 01:44:03,560
- 有关那些士兵失踪情报吗 - 太君 我...
- ...about the disappearance of our soldiers? - Sir, I...

1361
01:44:05,610 --> 01:44:07,570
我还没找到有用的情报
I have found nothing as yet.

1362
01:44:07,740 --> 01:44:10,680
你不觉得那个村子就是游击队的老窝吗
Do you think that one village is the center of this rebellion?

1363
01:44:10,840 --> 01:44:13,900
如果是的话 我们应该怎么找呢
And if it is, how can we find it?

1364
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:18,310
或许我们应该烧掉所有的房子 杀死所有的村民
and shoot all the farmers.

1365
01:44:18,490 --> 01:44:21,450
这样还会有人刚反抗皇军吗
Will that end this stupid resistance?

1366
01:44:21,620 --> 01:44:23,820
但是这样的话 太君 这样的话
Perhaps, sir. Perhaps, but then...

1367
01:44:23,990 --> 01:44:27,150
来年怎么找人去种播种收割啊
...who would plant and harvest the crop next year if you did that?

1368
01:44:27,330 --> 01:44:30,520
如果没有了收成 士兵就没饭吃啊
And if there was no crop,how could your army here be fed?

1369
01:44:30,700 --> 01:44:35,000
- 你们吃饭也会成问题了啊 太君  - 我们知道 中国佬
- How would you yourselves eat, great ones? - We thought of that, Chinaman.

1370
01:44:35,170 --> 01:44:37,660
我们只是想知道 你是不是也明白这一点
We only wondered if you had also.

1371
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:39,960
- 既然我们有这个共识  - 是的 太君
- And so we are all agreed. - Yes, great one.

1372
01:44:40,140 --> 01:44:42,700
我们都认为我们必须找到游击队的老窝
We are agreed that we must find that center.

1373
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:44,710
- 然后消灭他们 - 是的 太君
- And destroy it. - Yes, great one.

1374
01:44:44,880 --> 01:44:47,350
- 你也必须协助我们   - 好的 谢谢
- And it will be your privilege to help us. - Thank you.

1375
01:44:47,510 --> 01:44:52,350
我很快就会有消息的 如果可能的话 很快就会知道的
I will have information soon. If it is possible, very soon.

1376
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:54,040
谢谢
Thank you.

1377
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:59,590
没有汉奸 我们怎么占领这个国家呢
How could we conquer a country without its traitors?

1378
01:45:02,530 --> 01:45:06,630
他们让我去逗士兵笑
They order me to broaden the smile on the face of the soldier.

1379
01:45:07,900 --> 01:45:13,000
难道他们不知道我是在虎口拔牙吗
Do they not know a broader smile will only make him resemble a shark the more?

1380
01:45:13,270 --> 01:45:15,760
你没告诉他们关于我老家的事情吧
You did not speak of your new knowledge?

1381
01:45:17,240 --> 01:45:18,900
没有
I did not.

1382
01:45:19,080 --> 01:45:20,380
你会不会说出去
Will you ever speak of it?

1383
01:45:21,250 --> 01:45:24,110
只要我能 我尽量不说
As long as I am able, I will not.

1384
01:45:24,280 --> 01:45:26,410
但是万一你不能呢 然后会不会呢
But when you are no longer able,what then?

1385
01:45:26,590 --> 01:45:28,710
我怎么知道啊
How can I tell that?

1386
01:45:29,020 --> 01:45:31,350
我怎么知道明天自己会怎样做啊
How does a man know today what he must do tomorrow?

1387
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:34,190
你怕了 你现在进退两难了
You are afraid. You are in danger here.

1388
01:45:34,360 --> 01:45:36,630
我什么时候不进退两难?
Where am I not in danger?

1389
01:45:36,800 --> 01:45:40,130
这个年代 谁还敢跟豺狼虎豹住在一起啊
In these times, one chooses to live in the den of the tiger or the lion.

1390
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:42,000
也没有其他地方了
There is no other place.

1391
01:45:42,170 --> 01:45:44,360
我只是墙头草而已
And I am a man in the middle.

1392
01:45:45,070 --> 01:45:49,030
怎么可能不会动摇呢
How can a man in the middle stay there without splitting himself?

1393
01:45:49,410 --> 01:45:52,500
如果这样的话 那就危险了
And if he does that, he is only half a man.

1394
01:45:52,810 --> 01:45:57,270
谁都可能随时要了我的命啊
Half. Can half a man still live?

1395
01:45:59,350 --> 01:46:01,050
三表弟啊
Here is our third cousin.

1396
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:03,260
你还好吧 老表
How are you, cousin?

1397
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:05,850
怎么啦
What is it?

1398
01:46:06,590 --> 01:46:09,320
我就应该把我老婆给掐死
I should have killed her even as she spoke.

1399
01:46:09,500 --> 01:46:11,260
你想掐死谁
Who would you kill then?

1400
01:46:11,430 --> 01:46:13,190
我家老婆子
The female I call my wife.

1401
01:46:13,370 --> 01:46:15,730
她哪里又惹你了
Has that woman been snapping at your heels again?

1402
01:46:15,900 --> 01:46:18,390
我要是能掐死她 我自己也会死了算了
Had I killed her, I myself would have been killed...

1403
01:46:18,570 --> 01:46:20,900
这样村子就安全了
...but at least our village would now be safe...

1404
01:46:21,070 --> 01:46:22,510
乡亲们也没事了
...and all our kinsmen.

1405
01:46:22,680 --> 01:46:23,940
发生什么事了 表叔
What is this, cousin?

1406
01:46:25,550 --> 01:46:27,950
我坦白告诉你们
This is not easy for me to say but I must.

1407
01:46:28,110 --> 01:46:29,740
我老婆是个叛徒
My wife is a traitor.

1408
01:46:30,180 --> 01:46:33,380
她把所有事情都告诉吴连了
She has told Wu Lien all she knows of what happens here.

1409
01:46:33,550 --> 01:46:36,890
包括暗室 还有你们儿子跟游击队的事情
Of the secret room and your sons and the resistance.

1410
01:46:37,990 --> 01:46:40,860
吴连 这个走狗
Wu Lien, the running dog.

1411
01:46:41,760 --> 01:46:43,190
他必须保密
He must be silenced.

1412
01:46:43,360 --> 01:46:45,190
但是说不定他会说出去的
But he may not speak.

1413
01:46:45,370 --> 01:46:48,200
还有另外一个人可能会说出去的
There is another who has already spoken and may do so again...

1414
01:46:48,370 --> 01:46:50,170
三表婶
...the wife of our cousin here.

1415
01:46:50,340 --> 01:46:53,740
不会的相信我 她不会说出去的
I can say only this. She will speak no more.

1416
01:46:54,340 --> 01:46:55,710
你杀死她了
You have killed her.

1417
01:46:55,880 --> 01:46:59,170
没有 我狠狠揍了她一顿 揍到她刚刚...
No, no, I did not kill her. Although there was a moment...

1418
01:46:59,350 --> 01:47:01,340
都差点没气了
..when I thought she no longer breathed.

1419
01:47:01,510 --> 01:47:02,740
我揍啊揍
I beat her.

1420
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:06,250
揍到她站都站不起来
I beat her until she leaned against the wall to keep from falling.

1421
01:47:09,920 --> 01:47:11,580
那吴连怎么办
What then of Wu Lien?

1422
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:14,120
他至少是我们家的一份子啊
We must remember this:He is of our family.

1423
01:47:14,290 --> 01:47:16,130
我们儿子今晚可就要崇从山里回来的呀
Our sons return from the hills tonight.

1424
01:47:16,300 --> 01:47:20,160
他们知道怎么抓住他的啊 村里只有一条回来的路
They will know how to deal with him. There is but one way.

1425
01:47:20,330 --> 01:47:24,100
我丈夫会跟我想到一块的 而且这件事情我们必须做
I know my husband will see it as I see it and be willing to do what must be done.

1426
01:47:24,540 --> 01:47:26,700
你们打算杀死你们姐夫
Would you have him kill his brother-in-law?

1427
01:47:27,240 --> 01:47:29,830
总比被姐夫杀死好吧
Rather than have his brother-in-law kill him.

1428
01:47:32,210 --> 01:47:34,580
我自己没办法决定
I cannot decide this alone.

1429
01:47:35,350 --> 01:47:37,110
来吧 老表
Come, cousin.

1430
01:47:37,280 --> 01:47:39,680
这可关系到全村老小啊
It concerns us all in the village.

1431
01:47:41,720 --> 01:47:44,520
如果天下和平了 一切还会是变回老样子吗
Can anything ever be the same again even though peace comes?

1432
01:47:44,690 --> 01:47:49,560
没了这些小事情 我就是大老爷们一个了
Some small good has come of this.Out of it, I am born a man again.

1433
01:47:53,000 --> 01:47:54,900
我必须进城
I must go to the city.

1434
01:47:55,070 --> 01:47:57,260
我从你眼睛里看出来了
I read what you would do in your eyes.

1435
01:47:57,440 --> 01:48:00,240
- 你站在我一边吗 娘  - 我跟你站一边
- You are with me on this, Mother? - I am with you, Daughter.

1436
01:48:00,410 --> 01:48:03,570
男人开会的时候 我们女人就开始行动了
Women ever must act while men waste time in talk.

1437
01:48:05,480 --> 01:48:07,500
一点点这个东西
The great power of this...

1438
01:48:07,680 --> 01:48:13,180
无色无味 杀人无形
...is that a grain kills in a second
and is as tasteless as flour.

1439
01:48:13,350 --> 01:48:17,310
最近很多女人买这个东西
Many women buy this poison in these times.

1440
01:48:17,490 --> 01:48:21,520
多数给自己 也有给别人的
Some for themselves and some for others.

1441
01:48:21,690 --> 01:48:23,750
你需要多少
How much will you need?

1442
01:48:23,930 --> 01:48:27,630
我自己可能不需要了 我相信我也用不着
I may not need any at all.I hope I do not.

1443
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:31,030
但是我今天能买 我就多买一些
But I will take as much as I have money to buy.

1444
01:48:51,320 --> 01:48:52,920
吴连在吗
Wu Lien?

1445
01:49:26,130 --> 01:49:28,490
小玉 怎么是你啊
Jade. It cannot be.

1446
01:49:28,660 --> 01:49:30,890
你好啊 大姐 姐夫呢
How are you, sister-in-law?

1447
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:33,130
房子的守卫不错啊
This house is well-guarded.

1448
01:49:33,300 --> 01:49:36,560
我一说我是你们亲戚 他们就让我进来了
But when I told them I was your relative, the gate opened like magic.

1449
01:49:36,740 --> 01:49:40,400
他们站自己岗而已 不针对你大姐夫的
Yes, they guard themselves, but not against my husband.

1450
01:49:40,740 --> 01:49:43,210
你为什么这样看着我 见到我不高兴吗
Why do you stare so at me? Are you not glad to see me?

1451
01:49:43,380 --> 01:49:45,470
不是不是 我很高兴
Yes. Yes, I am glad.

1452
01:49:45,650 --> 01:49:48,440
看起来你气色不错啊 除了瘦一点
You look well, if not fat.

1453
01:49:48,620 --> 01:49:52,570
我还没有时间休息呢 昨天刚从解放区回来
I have not rested yet. I returned from the free land only yesterday.

1454
01:49:52,750 --> 01:49:54,850
- 昨天  - 我的丝绸上衣呢
- Only yesterday? - Where's my silk coat, I...

1455
01:49:55,020 --> 01:49:57,960
小玉来看我们了 她昨天刚刚回啦
Here is Jade to see us. She tells me she returned but yesterday.

1456
01:49:58,120 --> 01:50:01,290
我跟我老公儿子一起回来的 他们现在还在睡觉呢
Together with my husband and son. And today, they still sleep.

1457
01:50:01,460 --> 01:50:04,260
欢迎欢迎 弟妹 很高兴看到你们回来
Welcome, sister-in-law,we're glad you are home again.

1458
01:50:04,430 --> 01:50:06,420
二老两个人孤独太久了
The old ones have been too long alone.

1459
01:50:08,940 --> 01:50:13,570
- 我的上衣呢  - 这里 可以穿了
- Now, where is my coat? - Here it is. Ready for you to wear.

1460
01:50:15,070 --> 01:50:18,310
我老公今晚要参加皇军的一个聚会
My husband will be honored tonight at a banquet for the conquerors.

1461
01:50:18,480 --> 01:50:21,470
是的 我得赶紧去穿衣服先
Yes, and now I must dress for it.

1462
01:50:22,480 --> 01:50:24,850
我们两个女人说话不影响你吧 姐夫
Will not our women's prattle disturb him?

1463
01:50:25,020 --> 01:50:27,850
不会不会 我听不到的
Oh, no, no. I will not hear it.

1464
01:50:32,290 --> 01:50:34,990
我穿过城里的时候 看到一些不一样的地方
As I came through the city, I found many changes.

1465
01:50:35,160 --> 01:50:37,290
我老公说 皇军很高兴看到...
My husband says the conqueror prides himself...

1466
01:50:37,460 --> 01:50:39,430
他做得一些群众工作
...on the public improvements he has made.

1467
01:50:39,600 --> 01:50:41,000
群众工作
Improvements?

1468
01:50:41,170 --> 01:50:44,070
我看到士兵在贴海报
Today, I saw enemy soldiers pasting up a picture...

1469
01:50:44,240 --> 01:50:48,670
上面画着日本鬼子笑着发放食物给..
...which showed another enemy soldier smiling and giving food to our people...

1470
01:50:49,040 --> 01:50:50,410
跪在地上的人们
...who knelt before him.

1471
01:50:50,840 --> 01:50:55,440
那是我老公画的 画看起来还不错吧
That is my husband's handiwork. Is it not good to look upon?

1472
01:50:55,620 --> 01:50:57,170
还可以
Very.

1473
01:50:57,620 --> 01:51:01,180
那张画下面的人
Beneath the picture and looking up at it stood hungry people.

1474
01:51:01,350 --> 01:51:04,080
正端着碗
And they brought bowls and crept close...

1475
01:51:04,260 --> 01:51:07,850
偷偷得把画下面的浆糊抠下来
...and scooped up some of the paste that the soldiers were using.

1476
01:51:08,030 --> 01:51:11,000
然后吃掉
And then they ran away and hid and ate it.

1477
01:51:11,160 --> 01:51:13,500
吃浆糊
Ate the paste?

1478
01:51:14,070 --> 01:51:15,800
总比饿死好啊
Even that is better than nothing.

1479
01:51:15,970 --> 01:51:17,770
但是皇军发粮食的啊
But the conqueror does give food.

1480
01:51:17,940 --> 01:51:21,170
我们有拿到的啊 其他人也应该有啊
He gives it to us and there must be others.

1481
01:51:22,110 --> 01:51:24,100
是的 也会啊
Yes, there are others.

1482
01:51:24,610 --> 01:51:28,600
鬼子也给孩子们吃糖
The enemy sometimes gives sweets, and often to children.

1483
01:51:28,780 --> 01:51:32,740
至少这件事情不是什么坏事啊
Well, then, you must admit that giving sweets to children is not evil.

1484
01:51:33,790 --> 01:51:36,760
不是坏事 里面可是有鸦片啊
Is it not? In the sweets is opium.

1485
01:51:37,420 --> 01:51:41,620
小孩子们一旦吃下去 浑身血管就像着火一样
When once the children eat it, they have the hunger that is fire in their veins.

1486
01:51:41,790 --> 01:51:44,590
一辈子就彻底毁掉了
And so they are spoiled forever.

1487
01:51:47,070 --> 01:51:48,590
你家小孩看起来就很好
Your own children look well.

1488
01:51:52,670 --> 01:51:55,800
日本话学的很快嘛 这小孩
He has learned the tongue of the enemy very quickly.

1489
01:51:57,180 --> 01:51:59,240
谁知道长大了会不会变成日本人呢
Who knows what he may grow up to say in it.

1490
01:51:59,410 --> 01:52:02,070
我们会用自己的东西教好他们的
We will remember our own things to tell him.

1491
01:52:02,250 --> 01:52:04,650
别忘了告诉他们其他小孩发生的事情
Then do not forget to tell him of the other children.

1492
01:52:04,820 --> 01:52:07,080
还有那些小孩子父母的遭遇
And the mothers and fathers of those children...

1493
01:52:07,890 --> 01:52:10,450
他们都被绑在一起 泡在汽油里面
...all tied together and soaked with oil.

1494
01:52:10,620 --> 01:52:12,990
活活被烧死 无论他们怎么哀求
And burned alive while they cried for mercy.

1495
01:52:13,160 --> 01:52:15,680
我不想再听到这些事情了
I will hear no more of this. All the killing.

1496
01:52:15,860 --> 01:52:18,590
告诉你老婆别怕 姐夫
Tell your wife not to shudder,brother-in-law.

1497
01:52:18,770 --> 01:52:22,790
这些事情 每天都在发生
People now take these as things that may happen to any one of us.

1498
01:52:22,970 --> 01:52:25,530
- 每天都有  - 我得先去喝口茶
- And any day. - I will get tea.

1499
01:52:27,110 --> 01:52:28,730
我希望自己没有打扰到你们 姐夫
I trust I did not disturb you.

1500
01:52:28,910 --> 01:52:31,100
我听说的事情不多
I heard very little.

1501
01:52:32,610 --> 01:52:36,510
你是不是也变得麻木不仁无 动于衷了啊
Can it be that you have trained your ears not to hear what you do not wish to hear?

1502
01:52:36,680 --> 01:52:38,340
你...
You...

1503
01:52:39,820 --> 01:52:44,520
你得原谅你大姐 她只是一个普通女人 跟我们不一样
You must forgive my wife. She is but a woman and not as we are.

1504
01:52:44,690 --> 01:52:47,020
我从来不认为我们是一路人
I do not think we are the same.

1505
01:52:47,190 --> 01:52:49,660
我想你是在跟我们这些人作对
I think you are against me and all who are with me.

1506
01:52:49,830 --> 01:52:51,920
我不跟任何人作对
I am against no one.

1507
01:52:52,700 --> 01:52:55,030
那你支持我们吗
Are you for us, then?

1508
01:53:05,450 --> 01:53:07,240
我不支持也不反对
I'm neither for nor against anything.

1509
01:53:07,410 --> 01:53:10,210
你不支持就是反对
What you are not for, you are against.

1510
01:53:11,420 --> 01:53:14,550
你去了解放区 人就变了
You have changed while you were away in the free land.

1511
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:17,420
我可不知道这样的变化对于你而言好不好
I'm not sure the change becomes you.

1512
01:53:17,590 --> 01:53:19,820
不 不 不好
No. No, it does not.

1513
01:53:19,990 --> 01:53:23,260
女人就应该柔情万种
A woman should be soft, like the skin of a peach.

1514
01:53:23,430 --> 01:53:26,190
而不是铁石心肠 这样对谁都不好
Not hard like the stone which does no one any good.

1515
01:53:26,370 --> 01:53:29,960
你可别忘了 石头里面才能长出大树的
Do not forget that the tree itself grows from the stone.

1516
01:53:30,140 --> 01:53:33,040
那可是万物开始地方
Surely that is the beginning of everything.

1517
01:53:33,940 --> 01:53:37,310
我要是能偶尔看看爹娘 我就很知足了
If I could see my parents sometimes I would be content.

1518
01:53:37,480 --> 01:53:39,500
你老公很知足 我觉得你应该也是啊 大姐
Your husband is content and so must you be.

1519
01:53:39,680 --> 01:53:43,240
是的 我就是这样 我老婆也是
Yes, I am what I am. And so is my wife.

1520
01:53:43,420 --> 01:53:47,320
她总是恪守妇道
And she is one who has always known her place as a woman and kept to it.

1521
01:53:47,490 --> 01:53:50,080
你能帮我转达一下爹娘
Will you tell my parents this for me?

1522
01:53:50,260 --> 01:53:53,380
- 告诉他们我很挂念他们   - 会的会的 小玉会告诉他们的
- Will you tell them I think of them often? - Yes, she will tell them.

1523
01:53:53,560 --> 01:53:57,620
现在你去看看孩子是不是该喂了 我们还有事情要说
And now, if you wish to feed your children, we will excuse you.

1524
01:54:00,100 --> 01:54:02,830
你不跟我一起喝喝茶吗 姐夫
Will you not share some tea with me, brother-in-law...

1525
01:54:03,000 --> 01:54:05,400
虽然我一介女流
...although I am only a woman?

1526
01:54:05,570 --> 01:54:07,600
来吧 我帮你倒茶
Come, I will pour it for you.

1527
01:54:07,770 --> 01:54:09,670
不用不用 不麻烦你啦
No. Although I thank you.

1528
01:54:09,840 --> 01:54:12,240
我想东西的时候 吃不下东西的
I cannot eat when I have something on my mind to do.

1529
01:54:12,410 --> 01:54:15,280
我现在肚子饿得咕咕叫了
My stomach growls and takes offense.

1530
01:54:15,450 --> 01:54:19,080
那是那是 你怎么说也是一个很会审时度势的人啊
Surely you are a man who should nourish himself at every opportunity.

1531
01:54:19,250 --> 01:54:22,740
别担心我 我今晚会大吃一顿的
Do not worry about me. I will eat myself full tonight.

1532
01:54:22,920 --> 01:54:25,790
有烤鸭 我最喜欢吃烤鸭了
There is duck and I am very fond of duck.

大厨啊 一切都安排好了吧
Well, then, cook,I trust everything in the kitchen is well.

01:54:31,830 --> 01:54:34,730
你喊我来 我就来了 别跟我废话了
You sent for me. I am here. Do not waste time on idle talk.

1536
01:54:34,900 --> 01:54:36,770
我喊你来是想知道...
Yes, I sent for you, but only to ask...

1537
01:54:36,940 --> 01:54:39,840
所有吃的是不是按照我的要求准备好了

你看到了吧 我们有的是吃的 绰绰有余
You see, we have plenty of food here.More than enough.

1544
01:55:04,460 --> 01:55:06,450
- 你要不带点回去家里  - 不用了
- Will you not take some home with you? - No.

1545
01:55:06,630 --> 01:55:10,330
等等 为什么不呢 反正吃不完也得喂狗啊 为什么不拿一点呢
Oh, but why? It will only be thrown to the dogs. Why do you not take it?

1546
01:55:10,500 --> 01:55:13,530
因为我们不是狗 姐夫
Because, brother-in-law we are not dogs.

1547

等一下 你不能进去 陌生人是不能进去的
Wait. You cannot enter. Strangers are not allowed in the kitchen.

你们不是要请人吗
Did you not send for someone?

1550
01:55:58,650 --> 01:56:00,480
不是要个新厨子吗
A new cook, perhaps?

1551
01:56:00,650 --> 01:56:04,050
我不觉得你会做饭
Well, I would not think cooking is one of your talents.

1552
01:56:04,220 --> 01:56:07,560
你不试试怎么知道
How can you know that until you have tried me?

1553

我把她轰到大街上
I will throw her into the street.

1554
01:56:11,160 --> 01:56:14,760
不用 我晚点亲自轰她出去
I will do that myself. Later, perhaps.

1555
01:56:17,040 --> 01:56:18,970

Get on with your work.

1556
01:56:22,540 --> 01:56:24,700
你怎么来到这个房子的
How did you get into this house?

1557
01:56:24,880 --> 01:56:27,710
奇怪吗 吴连叫我来的
Is it not plain? Wu Lien sent for me.

1558
01:56:27,880 --> 01:56:29,370

快点告诉我 为什么溜进来厨房
Now, tell me, why did you come into the kitchen, huh?

1562

我饿了 我知道这里有吃的
I am hungry. There is food here.

1563
01:56:47,930 --> 01:56:50,420
那吴连为什么不给你啊
Why, did you not get food from Wu Lien?

1564
01:56:50,600 --> 01:56:53,940
吴连没记性 而且也不会一直给我吃的
Wu Lien will not last. He could not feed me for long.

1565
01:56:54,110 --> 01:56:57,440
我也不会给你吃的啊 中国人是不能进厨房的

但是我不属于任何国家 我只是一个女人而已
But I am one who is of no country.I am only a woman.

1567

我跟日本人在一起 难道你还要怪我吗
Can you blame me if I would be
with those who have conquered here?

01:57:06,650 --> 01:57:09,450
- 这么说你喜欢我们咯 - 不 一点都不

所以你不怕我们
Oh, so you're not afraid.

1571
01:57:16,860 --> 01:57:20,390
我这不捡大便宜了 找到一个不怕我们的女人
Can it be that I have found a woman of my own liking?

1572
01:57:20,570 --> 01:57:24,130
- 那你会给我吃的吗 - 吃的 东西很贵的
- You will feed me then? - Feed you? Food is dear.

1573
01:57:24,770 --> 01:57:26,290
你打算用什么付钱啊
How will you pay for it?

1574
01:57:26,470 --> 01:57:31,710
怎么付钱 我试试能不能帮忙在厨房做点事情
How? How else then to make myself useful?

1575

1581
01:57:56,570 --> 01:57:59,940

Fine duck. Gravy. Gravy for the duck.

1587

蘑菇呢 蘑菇在哪里
Mushrooms. Where are the mushrooms?

1588
01:58:49,290 --> 01:58:51,150

Noodles. More noodles, hurry.

1590
01:58:56,260 --> 01:58:59,390
你个蠢货 别把汁烧焦了
You fool. Do not burn the sauce.

I have said stay out of my way.

1593
01:59:50,250 --> 01:59:53,220
眼睛就只知道看着吃的 不看我
So you have eyes only for the food,not for me, huh?

1594

上菜 趁热端上去给他们
Here, now, take these.Serve them while they're hot.

你吃完了才让你走
You would not be leaving before you have eaten.

1616
02:02:06,820 --> 02:02:09,690
我实在饿的不行了 我去别的地方吃去
I was weary of waiting. I would eat elsewhere.

1617

有什么所谓 这样的女人对你没什么好处
Why the difference? A woman like that is too good for you.

1623

现在我们两人都没机会了
Now neither of us will have her.

02:04:07,670 --> 02:04:09,400
发生什么事啦
What is it?

1630
02:04:12,280 --> 02:04:14,140
鬼子...
The enemy...

1631
02:04:14,650 --> 02:04:16,480
被下毒了
...was poisoned.

1632
02:04:17,550 --> 02:04:18,980
他们怪罪到我身上
They blame me.

1633
02:04:19,150 --> 02:04:21,140
快去找你爹 带上孩子们 快
Go to your father. Take children. Quick.

1634
02:04:21,320 --> 02:04:23,520
- 快快  - 不 不 我不能
- Quick, quick. - No. No, I cannot.

1635
02:04:23,690 --> 02:04:25,350
谁干的
Who did this?

1636
02:04:25,520 --> 02:04:26,960
快走
Go.

1637
02:04:53,690 --> 02:04:56,480
乡亲们没有达成一致
Our kinsmen are not agreed among themselves.

1638
02:04:56,890 --> 02:04:59,360
有些人说杀了吴连
Some say kill Wu Lien at once.

1639
02:04:59,660 --> 02:05:03,420
我赞成杀了吴连 让我来杀都行
I say kill Wu Lien. Yes, kill him and let me do it.

1640
02:05:03,600 --> 02:05:07,550
老天爷会保佑我的 给我力量跟时间去干掉他
Heaven will lead me to the place and time and heaven will put power in my hand.

1641
02:05:07,730 --> 02:05:09,830
别老天这 老天那的
Do not say heaven this and heaven that.

1642
02:05:10,000 --> 02:05:12,470
如果我们要杀人 就别说是老天说的
If we kill, let us not say it is heaven who bids it.

1643
02:05:12,640 --> 02:05:14,870
互相残杀都不是老天的旨意
It is not heaven's will that men kill each other.

1644
02:05:15,040 --> 02:05:17,670
这我们知道 你就应该跟那些老不死的呆在一起
We know better. You lie dead with your ancestors...

1645
02:05:17,840 --> 02:05:21,240
- 而不是坐在这里  - 你怎么生出来这样的儿子啊
- ...instead of living. - How could you have borne such a son?

1646
02:05:21,410 --> 02:05:24,870
- 你不就是他爹吗  - 吴连怎么说也是我们家人啊
- How could you have fathered him? - Wu Lien is of our family.

1647
02:05:25,050 --> 02:05:28,280
我们只能希望他会顾虑这一点 而不会出卖我们
It is our one hope that he cannot bring himself to destroy us.

1648
02:05:28,450 --> 02:05:30,980
事到如今我们只能这样认为了
But we must be sure.

1649
02:05:32,990 --> 02:05:36,260
娘 娘 我是你女儿啊
My mother, my father,it is your daughter.

1650
02:05:36,430 --> 02:05:37,990
我去开门
I will go.

1651
02:05:42,800 --> 02:05:44,830
- 娘 娘!  - 怎么啦这是
-  Mother. Mother. - What is it?

1652
02:05:45,000 --> 02:05:48,100
吴连死了
My husband is dead.

1653
02:05:50,980 --> 02:05:54,880
有人在司令部的食物里面下毒
And so poison was put into the food of the high enemy officials by someone...

1654
02:05:55,050 --> 02:05:57,570
他们怪罪我丈夫 然后就把他杀了
...and they blamed my husband for it and killed him.

1655
02:05:57,750 --> 02:05:59,550
- 鬼子杀死他了   - 他们开枪杀了他
- The enemy killed him? - They shot him.

1656
02:05:59,720 --> 02:06:03,650
他在最后的快断气的时候跑回了家 让我快走
And he came to me holding the last of his life inside him with his hands.

1657
02:06:03,820 --> 02:06:07,820
他只是为了这个家啊 但是现在他死了
He lived only for his family, and now he is dead.

1658
02:06:07,990 --> 02:06:10,990
- 他多好一个人啊  - 我的希望落空了
- He was so good. - I have been cheated of my pleasure.

1659
02:06:11,160 --> 02:06:15,290
你今天也看到了啊 小玉 如今他都死了啊
You were there today, Jade. You saw him. And now he's dead.

1660
02:06:15,470 --> 02:06:19,030
我丈夫死了 我都成寡妇了
My husband is gone and I'm a widow.

1661
02:06:42,730 --> 02:06:44,790
女人是下毒的高手啊
Poison is a woman's weapon.

1662
02:06:47,030 --> 02:06:48,930
是的
Yes, it is.

1663
02:06:49,100 --> 02:06:51,540
是我干的
And it was I who used it.

1664
02:06:52,270 --> 02:06:53,970
我早知道了
I thought so.

1665
02:06:54,440 --> 02:06:57,310
我看到你跟娘在嘀咕着什么
I saw the look that passed between you and my mother.

1666
02:06:58,040 --> 02:07:00,440
你告诉我要坚定信念的
You said we must be sure.

1667
02:07:00,810 --> 02:07:02,710
我很坚定
I was sure.

1668
02:07:03,450 --> 02:07:05,680
他可能会告密 背叛我们全家
He would have betrayed us.

1669
02:07:06,120 --> 02:07:09,280
我没有打算杀他 也没打算让他死
I would not have killed him had I thought he would not.

1670
02:07:12,960 --> 02:07:14,820
你没有杀他
You did not kill him.

1671
02:07:16,630 --> 02:07:18,290
鬼子杀的而已
The enemy did.

1672
02:07:18,460 --> 02:07:19,900
不
No.

1673
02:07:20,670 --> 02:07:24,500
肯定是我害死他的 这点我很肯定
No, I killed him as surely as I'm now here.

1674
02:07:24,670 --> 02:07:27,070
他也是我们之间的一份子啊
And he was one of ours.

1675
02:07:27,610 --> 02:07:29,870
他罪有应得而已
It was right that he should die.

1676
02:07:37,720 --> 02:07:39,880
你会怪我吗
And will you hate me?

1677
02:07:40,650 --> 02:07:42,680
我为什么要怪你呢
Why would I hate you?

1678
02:07:45,060 --> 02:07:47,360
我这么瘦
I am so thin.

1679
02:07:48,330 --> 02:07:51,490
一身骨头
My flesh is so hard.

1680
02:07:52,060 --> 02:07:57,200
一副黄脸婆的样子
My face is dark and not like a woman's face.

1681
02:07:59,340 --> 02:08:02,870
你是跟刚结婚的时候不一样
You do not look as you did when I married you, it is true.

1682
02:08:03,840 --> 02:08:07,800
如果我当年也长成现在这样 你还会娶我吗
Would you have married me then if I had looked as I do now?

1683
02:08:07,980 --> 02:08:09,910
肯定 不会
Doubtless, I would not.

1684
02:08:14,850 --> 02:08:18,220
但是我也不是当年的我了啊
But I myself was not the same man that I am now.

1685
02:08:18,860 --> 02:08:21,950
那些东西 也不是我现在需要的
And what pleased me then would not please me now.

1686
02:08:24,760 --> 02:08:28,430
- 那我有你需要的东西吗  - 有
- Do I please you now? - You do.

1687
02:08:30,000 --> 02:08:32,560
一直都有 你对我的爱...
As always, this feeling between us...

1688
02:08:32,740 --> 02:08:35,040
始终不变
...we can return to it from anything.

1689
02:08:39,910 --> 02:08:41,810
夏天过去了
And then summer was gone.

1690
02:08:41,980 --> 02:08:44,310
谷物开始有收成了
And the grain had kept its promise.

1691
02:08:44,480 --> 02:08:48,420
两个老人再次等待着小玉跟他们的二儿子的归来
Again, the old ones waited for the return of Jade and her husband...

1692
02:08:48,590 --> 02:08:52,520
他们去参加游击队的集会
... who'd been summoned to the meeting place in the hills.

1693
02:08:59,460 --> 02:09:01,160
有人来了
Someone comes.

1694
02:09:02,530 --> 02:09:05,300
是孩子们回来了吧
It is our children, home from the hills.

1695
02:09:08,010 --> 02:09:10,030
- 你们回来了啊   - 爹娘
- Well, then, you are back. - Father, Mother.

1696
02:09:10,210 --> 02:09:11,730
- 你们都好吧  - 都很好
- You are well. - Well enough.

1697
02:09:11,910 --> 02:09:13,540
-你们刚好回来帮忙收割庄稼
You are in time to help us harvest.

1698
02:09:13,710 --> 02:09:15,980
如果我们够聪明 应该可以平安过冬
If we are clever, we can pass this winter safely.

1699
02:09:16,150 --> 02:09:19,610
今年庄稼长得好 谷粒都沉甸甸的
The crop is good this year and the grain lies heavy in the hand.

1700
02:09:19,790 --> 02:09:21,310
是啊
Yes.

1701
02:09:21,490 --> 02:09:24,010
这片土地养活过多少代人啊
This field would feed many people.

1702
02:09:25,390 --> 02:09:27,690
爹 你能召集一下村里的当家们吗
Father, will you call the heads of the village?

1703
02:09:27,860 --> 02:09:29,590
我们有任务需要他们去做
We have a task for them to do.

1704
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:32,990
现在开会 现在天亮呢 太危险了
A meeting? But there is a danger in a meeting while it is still light.

1705
02:09:33,530 --> 02:09:36,020
告诉他们天一黑就集合
Tell them to gather at the first hour of the darkness.

1706
02:09:36,200 --> 02:09:38,530
有件事情我们必须马上去做
There is a thing we must do,and at once.

1707
02:09:38,700 --> 02:09:41,300
只要我们喂着鬼子 就打不倒他们
The enemy will never be defeated if we feed him...

1708
02:09:41,470 --> 02:09:43,340
但是如果没有我们的食物 他们就会饿死
...but without our food, he will starve.

1709
02:09:43,510 --> 02:09:46,000
- 我可不拆了我的房子 - 这太过分了
- I will not destroy food nor my house. - It's too much.

1710
02:09:46,180 --> 02:09:50,140
- 这样做没道理啊  - 这是指挥部要求的
- It's against the law of man to do it. - It is the task the high command has set.

1711
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:53,220
你们必须把所有东西都烧掉
You must burn all you have and leave only the ashes behind you.

1712
02:09:53,390 --> 02:09:56,790
儿子啊 你怎么能要求相亲们做这种事情啊
Can it be that you, my son, ask this of me and our kinsmen?

1713
02:09:56,960 --> 02:09:58,920
我说的是我们必须消灭鬼子们
I ask it that the enemy may be destroyed.

1714
02:09:59,090 --> 02:10:02,190
我们现在不仅仅要喂饱他们 还得替他们干活
Not only do we feed them but we stay here as their work animals.

1715
02:10:02,360 --> 02:10:04,350
你们这些年轻人只会胡言乱语啊
What we hear are the words of a young fool.

1716
02:10:04,530 --> 02:10:06,690
我是不会听你们的话的
I, for one, will not listen to any more.

1717
02:10:06,870 --> 02:10:09,200
我不会抛下我的家的 也不会离开我的土地的
I will not burn my house,nor leave what I have.

1718
02:10:09,370 --> 02:10:11,890
我们可不可以 留下来一边抵抗
But we... We resist here.

1719
02:10:12,070 --> 02:10:14,040
一边偷偷藏东西吃呢
We keep what food we can from the enemy...

1720
02:10:14,210 --> 02:10:16,200
然后有机会我们再打死他们呢
...and we kill him how and when we can.

1721
02:10:16,370 --> 02:10:18,340
- 这就够了吧  - 还远远不够
- It is enough. - It is not enough.

1722
02:10:18,510 --> 02:10:20,940
- 你不爱你的国家吗 爹  - 爱国?
- Do you not love your country? - Love my country?

1723
02:10:21,110 --> 02:10:24,780
你来告诉我 我难道不爱脚下这片土地吗
You say that to me? Do I not love this earth and is this earth not my country?

1724
02:10:24,950 --> 02:10:26,650
我死了也要留下来保护它啊
Though I die, I stay with it.

1725
02:10:26,820 --> 02:10:28,810
这世界上还有没有一个人能像这样去爱护她的国家
Can a man love his country better than that?

1726
02:10:28,990 --> 02:10:32,250
但是 爹 这片土地
But, my father,this earth is only your country...

1727
02:10:32,420 --> 02:10:34,220
只有国家和平的时候才属于你啊
...in peacetime when there is freedom.

1728
02:10:34,990 --> 02:10:38,190
我不管 我会留下来守护这片土地
I know only this. We must hold the land.

1729
02:10:38,360 --> 02:10:40,350
你也就只会守着这一块破地了
You will hold only a handful of dead soil.

1730
02:10:40,530 --> 02:10:42,560
你这样做早晚连你的国家都没有了
You will lose your whole country doing it.

1731
02:10:42,730 --> 02:10:45,330
- 我不想听  - 老凌说的对
- I will not listen. - Ling Tan is right as always.

1732
02:10:45,500 --> 02:10:48,960
是的 我们也要留下来 守着这片土地
Yes, we will not leave our land. We will hold it.

1733
02:11:04,820 --> 02:11:07,850
奇怪了 今晚怎么所有人都拉长了脸啊
Now, what's wrong with all these long faces?

1734
02:11:08,030 --> 02:11:09,820
我们没有谈妥
We have failed.

1735
02:11:11,730 --> 02:11:17,290
爹跟乡亲们都拒绝了我们的建议
Our kinsmen and our father among them have refused our plan.

1736
02:11:17,470 --> 02:11:21,130
- 你们怎么能不按上级的指示去做呢  - 我不会 相亲们也不会
- You will not do as you're told to do? - I will not, nor will the other kinsmen.

1737
02:11:21,340 --> 02:11:24,370
那就没办法了 现在只能用枪逼他们同意了
There's an answer. Hold a gun at their heads and make them do it.

1738
02:11:24,540 --> 02:11:27,510
- 还是得经过他们的同意才好啊  - 那些老不死的是不会同意的
- It must be their own will. - The old should be allowed no will.

1739
02:11:27,680 --> 02:11:30,200
又是什么老人年轻人这种说法 再开几次会不就好了嘛
The old and the new again. There must be some meeting.

1740
02:11:30,380 --> 02:11:32,650
开什么会 让这帮老不死的跟我们这些活人开会
There's no meeting what is dead and what is alive.

1741
02:11:32,820 --> 02:11:35,680
爹跟这些人一样都太老顽固了 活腻了
Father and men like him grow too old and have walked too long.

1742
02:11:35,850 --> 02:11:38,220
该是我们年轻人当家做主的时候了
Others need the room they take.

1743
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:44,930
你竟然敢打我
You may not strike me.

1744
02:11:45,530 --> 02:11:47,260
我就是要打你
I should beat you.

1745
02:11:47,430 --> 02:11:50,060
你现在只知道杀人 你个嗜血的畜生
Killing and love of killing, that is all you know.

1746
02:11:50,240 --> 02:11:52,970
是的 但是我很清楚 现在时代不同了
Yes, but I know it well. These are other times.

1747
02:11:53,140 --> 02:11:55,940
我也可以像杀死别人一样杀了你
And I can kill you as well as any other.

1748
02:11:56,910 --> 02:11:59,840
那是肯定 你可以杀了我
Yes, you can kill me.

1749
02:12:00,680 --> 02:12:03,650
你现在谁都可以杀了
I think you can kill anyone now.

1750
02:12:08,150 --> 02:12:09,550
但是我已经不想再杀人了
But I will kill no more.

1751
02:12:14,490 --> 02:12:16,290
- 你回来啊  - 我不会再回来这个家了
- Come back here. - I will not.

1752
02:12:16,460 --> 02:12:20,230
我受够了这个愚蠢的家了 今天是最后一次了
I've eaten enough foolishness in this house, and for the last time.

1753
02:12:25,370 --> 02:12:27,130
我得跟着他
I must go with him.

1754
02:12:29,770 --> 02:12:33,370
你们可以来游击队那里找我们 如果你们愿意来的话
You will find us in the hills,for you will follow us.

1755
02:12:34,780 --> 02:12:37,180
这个家完了
Happiness in this family is over.

1756
02:12:41,520 --> 02:12:43,150
没什么值得留恋的东西了
Nothing is left to anyone...

1757
02:12:43,320 --> 02:12:46,450
如果长辈都不能让晚辈听话的话
...if the old can no longer look to the young for obedience.

1758
02:12:46,630 --> 02:12:48,590
我这么说吧
I have come to this.

1759
02:12:48,790 --> 02:12:51,990
如果以后有人告诉我老三死了 我是不会掉一滴眼泪的
I will not grieve the day they tell me my third son is dead.

1760
02:12:56,670 --> 02:13:00,870
他已经变成了我最痛恨 最可怕的哪种人了
He has become the sort of man I hate and fear most.

1761
02:13:01,810 --> 02:13:05,070
这种人不会过安稳日子的
Such men will not allow peace in the world.

1762
02:13:05,240 --> 02:13:08,300
他们一碰到战争 就像干柴烈火一样
War springs from them as fire does from tinder...

1763
02:13:08,480 --> 02:13:10,970
好像这就是他们的人生乐趣
...and is their pleasure in their life.

1764
02:13:12,880 --> 02:13:15,610
这种人死了更好
Such men should die for the good of all.

1765
02:13:17,820 --> 02:13:19,980
你这是在指责你儿子的理想啊
You blame your son for what he is.

1766
02:13:20,760 --> 02:13:22,730
那我应该指责谁呢
Who should I blame, then?

1767
02:13:23,230 --> 02:13:26,630
他亲口反抗我 他是个不孝子啊
It was his own arm he raised against me and his own voice.

1768
02:13:27,000 --> 02:13:29,190
你不应该怪他的 爹
You cannot blame him.

1769
02:13:29,870 --> 02:13:32,340
他的生活都没有正常过
Has his life been as it should?

1770
02:13:32,800 --> 02:13:37,610
他有过安稳日子好去娶个老婆吗
Has he had peace to live and find a wife?

1771
02:13:37,780 --> 02:13:39,770
他有时间去生个小孩吗
Have sons of his own?

1772
02:13:40,850 --> 02:13:42,710
他把所有的时间都用在了一件事情上
No, he put the will he would have used...

1773
02:13:42,880 --> 02:13:45,280
整天打打杀杀
...into another thing: The will to kill.

1774
02:13:45,450 --> 02:13:48,720
从他看了第一次杀人之后 整个人就都变了
So changed from the boy who wretched at the sight of the first dead...

1775
02:13:48,890 --> 02:13:51,980
变得连自己的亲生父亲都打
...that he would strike his own father.

1776
02:13:52,960 --> 02:13:55,520
我们不也是变了很多吗
Well, are we not all changed?

1777
02:13:55,690 --> 02:13:59,860
如果不把鬼子赶出去 我们还能变回来吗
Can we get our old selves back if the devils are not driven out soon?

1778
02:14:02,100 --> 02:14:03,620
你可以吗
Can you?

1779
02:14:05,640 --> 02:14:07,100
你...
You...

1780
02:14:07,510 --> 02:14:09,500
你也能杀鬼子
You hate to kill above all else.

1781
02:14:09,670 --> 02:14:11,510
你杀过鬼子
Yet you have killed...

1782
02:14:11,680 --> 02:14:14,870
- 你比其他人都能杀鬼子  - 我不听
-  ...as skillfully as you once tilled the land. - I will not hear this.

1783
02:14:15,050 --> 02:14:17,880
你应该听听 你看娘 难道她就没变
But you shall hear it. And our mother, has she not changed?

1784
02:14:18,050 --> 02:14:20,540
她以前见到鬼子就跑 现在抡起锄头
Now she runs, takes up her hoe and buries the enemy...

1785
02:14:20,720 --> 02:14:22,650
迎头就能抡掉一个鬼子
...as though the human flesh were animal.

1786
02:14:22,820 --> 02:14:25,790
她还能变回去吗 她能忘了这些发生过的事情吗
Can she get back to the old way? Can she forget what she's done?

1787
02:14:25,960 --> 02:14:29,620
还有你的儿子们 个个都会杀人 你的三儿子更是个嗜血杀人狂
And your sons, they all kill. Your third son because he has come to love it.

1788
02:14:29,790 --> 02:14:33,160
你大儿子不是也因为觉得杀人轻而易举吗 而我老公
Your eldest because it's the easiest thing to do and my...

1789
02:14:33,330 --> 02:14:37,230
是因为他必须这么做 我们都杀人狂
Your second son because he must.But we all kill.

1790
02:14:37,400 --> 02:14:39,840
我们杀来杀去 你能否认这些事情吗
We kill and kill again. Can you deny this?

1791
02:14:40,000 --> 02:14:41,270
不 不 我不能
No, no, I cannot.

1792
02:14:41,440 --> 02:14:44,880
我自己都学会前面开完枪
I've learned to hold a gun and fire it from the doorway.

1793
02:14:45,040 --> 02:14:47,010
后门就回来喂儿子了
And then go in and feed my son.

1794
02:14:47,180 --> 02:14:50,580
你看看你孙子 吃的都是什么啊
And what is the child eat into himself with the food?

1795
02:14:51,420 --> 02:14:53,410
你瞧瞧 你仔细瞧瞧
Look at him. Look at him.

1796
02:14:53,590 --> 02:14:55,550
别转过去 看这里
Do not turn away.

1797
02:14:55,950 --> 02:15:00,250
即使你孙子都开始用牙齿磨弹壳了
Even now your grandchild sharpens his little teeth on an empty shell...

1798
02:15:00,430 --> 02:15:03,330
他都不怕火药味的
...and does not hate the taste of gunpowder.

1799
02:15:04,160 --> 02:15:08,260
他还小 也没什么思想
He's young still. His mind, at least, is untouched.

1800
02:15:08,430 --> 02:15:10,730
他还有救 还可以过正常人的生活
He can be saved and taught a decent way to live...

1801
02:15:10,900 --> 02:15:13,170
除非鬼子被我们赶出这个国家
...if the enemy is driven from our country.

1802
02:15:14,770 --> 02:15:18,140
如果这种战争的恐惧继续的话 他会变成什么
What will become of him if this horror goes on?

1803
02:15:18,640 --> 02:15:23,740
我应该怎么教会她城市 如果所有人都互相欺骗
How can I teach him honesty when he must lie and cheat to live?

1804
02:15:23,920 --> 02:15:28,650
我又怎么教会他仁慈 如果所有人都拼个你死我活
How can I teach him mercy when he must either kill first or be killed?

1805
02:15:28,820 --> 02:15:31,310
我如何叫他相信别人...
How can I teach him faith in mankind...

1806
02:15:31,490 --> 02:15:35,290
但他看到家里充满了不信任跟背叛呢
...when he sees nothing but distrust and when even in his own family are traitors.

1807
02:15:35,460 --> 02:15:37,490
- 难道我应该为此负责吗  - 你不用负责
- Am I to blame for these things? - You're not.

1808
02:15:37,660 --> 02:15:39,990
但是你有责任 我们都有责任
But you will be to blame, we'll all be to blame...

1809
02:15:40,170 --> 02:15:43,460
除非我们把鬼子们赶出我们国家...
...unless we defeat the Japanese and drive them from this country...

1810
02:15:43,640 --> 02:15:45,870
而且不让他们再次侵略我们
...and prevent them from ever doing this again.

1811
02:15:46,040 --> 02:15:49,440
如果你孩子问你为什么放弃这片土地 你该跟他如何解释呢
How will you answer your son when he asks you why you left our land?

1812
02:15:49,610 --> 02:15:51,100
我会告诉他...
I will tell him...

1813
02:15:51,280 --> 02:15:55,770
我会告诉他 我们这样做救了他跟全家
I will tell him it was to save him and his family...

1814
02:15:55,950 --> 02:15:58,420
还有整个国家
...and his whole country.

1815
02:16:01,490 --> 02:16:02,850
你没有...
You had no...

1816
02:16:03,620 --> 02:16:04,920
我不能这么做
I cannot...

1817
02:16:06,090 --> 02:16:08,820
我还是没想通.
For a cloud covers my mind.

1818
02:16:16,500 --> 02:16:18,470
老二 你现在作何打算
What will you do now, my son?

1819
02:16:18,640 --> 02:16:22,040
我们要加入游击队 至少我们可以跟鬼子继续斗下去
We will join our brothers in the hills where at least we can fight on.

1820
02:16:22,210 --> 02:16:26,230
天亮前我们就必须离家出发
We will leave this house during the last hours of the darkness before dawn.

1821
02:16:30,850 --> 02:16:33,410
这些是给你们路上吃的
Here is food for your journey.

1822
02:16:37,660 --> 02:16:39,990
你能来我们感激不尽
We are glad you have come.

1823
02:16:40,260 --> 02:16:42,520
我知道对你很不容易,
It would have been a bitter thing if you had not.

1824
02:16:45,430 --> 02:16:47,490
如果你们愿意等 我们跟你们一起走
If you can wait, we will go with you.

1825
02:16:47,670 --> 02:16:49,030
跟我们一起
Go with us?

1826
02:16:49,200 --> 02:16:51,930
是的 我会烧掉房子跟田地 跟你们一起走
Yes, I will burn my fields and my house and go with you.

1827
02:16:53,070 --> 02:16:55,600
我耳朵聋了吧 老头子?
Do my ears hear what you are saying, old man?

1828
02:16:55,770 --> 02:17:00,640
我们应当这么做 我心里没有顾虑了
They hear what we must do, for the cloud is now gone from my mind.

1829
02:17:00,850 --> 02:17:03,110
我已经跟乡亲们说过了
I have spoken to all our kinsmen in the village...

1830
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:05,310
告诉他们你昨晚说的事情
...and told them the things you told me.

1831
02:17:05,480 --> 02:17:07,880
我给他们时间考虑 但是我会先烧掉我的房子
I gave them the hour that I would fire my house...

1832
02:17:08,050 --> 02:17:09,880
然后让他们也烧掉自己的房子
..and asked them to do the same thing.

1833
02:17:10,050 --> 02:17:12,650
- 他们会吗  - 现在我不清楚
- But will they? - I do not know.

1834
02:17:12,820 --> 02:17:15,990
说服他们不容易 这不是他们的本性
It is a great deal to ask of them, and against their natures.

1835
02:17:16,160 --> 02:17:18,690
但是我跟我儿子怎么办
But what will become of me and my children?

1836
02:17:18,860 --> 02:17:22,090
带上他们去山里找老大去
You will go and take your children to where my sons are in the hills.

1837
02:17:22,270 --> 02:17:25,760
- 老沈家的儿子会照顾好大姐的  - 好 那我们去那里会合
- The son of Neighbor Shen can guide her. - Yes. We will meet you there.

1838
02:17:25,940 --> 02:17:28,300
你也带上我们儿子
And you will take our son too.

1839
02:17:39,080 --> 02:17:40,740
留点记号在这里
These things will mark our land...

1840
02:17:40,920 --> 02:17:43,750
说不定我们回来了还能找到这片地方
...so when we come back we can prove it is ours and claim it.

1841
02:17:53,430 --> 02:17:54,660
那是什么玩意啊
What nonsense is this?

1842
02:17:54,830 --> 02:17:58,270
一会这里全变成灰了 你现在瞎弄什么东西啊
In a while, these things will be ashes, so, what matter how they look now?

1843
02:17:58,440 --> 02:18:01,430
人死之前 是不是得有人帮忙料理一下后事啊
Would you bury a friend without first arranging him decently?

1844
02:18:06,540 --> 02:18:11,210
在这个屋子里面 你爹 你爷爷都住在这里
In these rooms, your father and his father before him died.

1845
02:18:11,850 --> 02:18:16,980
你的儿子也是在这里出生 按理也应该在这里终老的
And our children were born here and should die here.

1846
02:18:20,090 --> 02:18:22,030
我帮过你一次了 这次你来帮我挖洞
I helped you dig once, now you help me.

1847
02:18:36,670 --> 02:18:39,070
- 不过我还是有点担心  - 担心啥
- A worry has struck me. - What now, woman?

1848
02:18:39,240 --> 02:18:42,240
如果上次说的那个地里头另一边的陌生人 闯进来了
What if the stranger who walks on the other side of your land...

1849
02:18:42,410 --> 02:18:44,310
找到这些东西偷走了怎么办
...finds these things and steals them?

1850
02:18:44,480 --> 02:18:47,180
- 他不会偷我们的  - 你怎么知道
- He will not steal from us. - How can you know that?

1851
02:18:47,350 --> 02:18:51,550
我头一遭想得这么清楚啦
I see clearly now, and for the first time.

1852
02:18:51,720 --> 02:18:54,920
三表哥说了世界上只有一个太阳跟月亮
Third cousin once said that there is one sun and one moon for all.

1853
02:18:55,090 --> 02:18:57,390
如果这个是对的 大家都共用一个月亮跟太阳
If that is true, all share the sun and moon...

1854
02:18:57,560 --> 02:19:00,030
那我们为什么不共用一片土地呢
...why should we not also all share the earth?

1855
02:19:00,700 --> 02:19:03,900
这个村子只是这个世界的一小角落而已
This valley is not the world but only part of the world.

1856
02:19:04,070 --> 02:19:07,530
还有很多像我一样没见过世面的人
And there are others like me whose faces I have never seen.

1857
02:19:07,710 --> 02:19:09,610
而且 人们都是爱好和平的啊
Elsewhere, there are men who love peace...

1858
02:19:09,770 --> 02:19:12,610
他们心地善良 为了和平而战斗
...and long for good and who will fight to get these things.

1859
02:19:12,780 --> 02:19:17,110
这样一说 陌生人就不陌生 而是和我一模一样的人
So the stranger is no longer a stranger to me but a man like me.

1860
02:19:17,980 --> 02:19:20,180
要是我能认识他那该多好
If I could but know him.

1861
02:19:20,790 --> 02:19:22,380
要是我能看到他那该多好
If I could but see him.

1862
02:19:23,050 --> 02:19:25,490
但是你们语言不通怎么一起说话呢
What good to see him
if you could not speak?

1863
02:19:25,660 --> 02:19:27,680
你不用说
You would not need speech.

1864
02:19:27,860 --> 02:19:31,230
如果理想一样 就能彼此理解
If what you wish is the same, there would be understanding between you.

1865
02:19:31,400 --> 02:19:32,990
对的对的 是这样说的
Yes, that is true.

1866
02:19:33,160 --> 02:19:36,620
不知为什么 今晚我感觉到有股力量横扫全世界
Somehow tonight, I feel that there is a power sweeping around the world...

1867
02:19:36,800 --> 02:19:39,100
将全世界的陌生人都联合到了一起
...bringing us all together with that stranger.

1868
02:19:39,270 --> 02:19:41,860
- 我也感觉到了 爹  - 我也是
- And I, too, feel it, my father. - So do I.

1869
02:19:42,040 --> 02:19:45,240
- 我怎么感觉不到呢  - 到时间了爹
- Why am I left out of this?  - It is time now, my father.

1870
02:19:45,410 --> 02:19:47,610
- 我来点火吗 - 不
- Shall I fire the house? - No.

1871
02:19:48,750 --> 02:19:50,240
我跟你娘来
Your mother and I will do this.

1872
02:19:52,980 --> 02:19:55,710
我们先去烧掉东边的地
We will fire the east field first, then.

1873
02:19:56,590 --> 02:20:00,080
北边的最后再烧 这样我们可以从那里走出去
Leave the north fields for the last,so that we may escape that way.

1874
02:20:16,840 --> 02:20:18,240
老太婆 再多看一眼
Look back once, old woman.

1875
02:20:18,780 --> 02:20:20,940
以后就再也看不着了
Then look back no more.

1876
02:22:09,850 --> 02:22:11,850
沿着山路走
Keep to the hill road.

1877
02:22:36,710 --> 02:22:39,650
爹 快看
My father, look.

1878
02:22:47,530 --> 02:22:50,390
会不会是有个乡亲跟着我们呢
Can it be even one of our kinsmen is with us?

1879
02:22:50,560 --> 02:22:52,960
好像只是个灯笼
It is only a lantern.

1880
02:22:55,870 --> 02:22:59,030
不是不是 那是火
No. No, it is a fire.

1881
02:22:59,700 --> 02:23:02,670
- 还有还有  - 那边也点着了
- And there's another. - And another.

1882
02:23:02,840 --> 02:23:07,800
-不会吧 整个村子都点着了 -是的 老太婆 我们不是孤零零的一家子
- Can it be? The whole village? - It is, old woman. We are not alone.

1883
02:23:20,120 --> 02:23:24,220
- 我走不动了 老头子  - 你上次是不是还没有被打舒服
- I'm weary, my lord. - But you are not bruised as yet.

1884
02:24:22,120 --> 02:24:23,590
你怎么不跟我们一起走
Why can you not come with us?

1885
02:24:23,750 --> 02:24:26,090
不 娘 我和我弟弟们属于这里
No, my mother. My place is here with my brothers.

1886
02:24:26,260 --> 02:24:29,350
敌人不敢来这里的 娘 大姐会平安无事 还会有饭吃的
The enemy fears to come here. My sister will be safe and have food.

1887
02:24:29,560 --> 02:24:35,290
这样最好 前面的路会很难走的 老太婆 我们女儿她....
I think it best. Our road ahead will be hard, old woman. And our daughter...

1888
02:24:45,710 --> 02:24:49,670
爹 我看到你们做的事情了 我也看到乡亲们所做的牺牲了
My father, I have seen what you have done, and the others also.

1889
02:24:49,850 --> 02:24:51,140
我感到很惭愧
I am ashamed.

1890
02:24:51,820 --> 02:24:53,250
我更惭愧 我的儿子啊
No more than I, my son.

1891
02:24:53,420 --> 02:24:56,080
我现在真正觉得你才是
Well, then, I would have you take your place of command...

1892
02:24:56,250 --> 02:24:58,020
真正的一家之主
...as head of our family once more.

1893
02:24:58,260 --> 02:25:01,780
我知道另外一个更重要的事情 比一家之主还重要
I think there is now another command,even above that.

1894
02:25:01,960 --> 02:25:05,260
我们都知道我们应该去做些什么 而且我们也会去做
We have each been told what we must do, and we will do it.

1895
02:25:05,430 --> 02:25:08,830
- 你们年轻人留下来跟鬼子打仗  - 那你呢 爹
- You that our young will stay here and fight. - And you, Father?

1896
02:25:09,170 --> 02:25:12,030
我得去给这双老手找一个用得上它们的地方
I would be where these hands can be used.

1897
02:25:12,200 --> 02:25:14,330
我打算跟你娘去解放区
I and my old woman will go into free China...

1898
02:25:14,510 --> 02:25:17,170
好给你们这些打仗的年轻人种点吃
...and raise food to fill your bellies while you fight.

1899
02:25:17,340 --> 02:25:21,040
那我们就出发了 趁着现在还有力气
Let us go, then, while the strength is still in us.

1900
02:25:23,110 --> 02:25:24,580
还有一件事情
There is a thing.

1901
02:25:24,750 --> 02:25:27,720
如果我们有人活着回来 记得回来 认领我们的地
If one of us lives, he must go back one day to claim the land.

1902
02:25:27,890 --> 02:25:29,680
我就这么吩咐你们了
I so charge you all.

1903
02:25:29,850 --> 02:25:31,950
如果你们还活着 就应该回来看看
If you live, you must do this.

1904
02:25:32,120 --> 02:25:34,350
我们陪你走一段 爹
My wife and I will walk a little way with you.

1905
02:25:34,530 --> 02:25:36,820
我们去送送你们
We would see you out of sight.

1906
02:25:50,670 --> 02:25:53,440
今天我们虽然要分离了 但是感觉比以前都要亲近
At this moment we part,we are closer than ever before.

1907
02:25:53,610 --> 02:25:55,580
这小家伙什么时候开始念书啊
When will this one begin to read?

1908
02:25:55,750 --> 02:25:57,300
越快越好
As soon as he can be taught.

1909
02:25:57,520 --> 02:26:02,510
他会学得很快的 他可是我们未来的希望啊
He will learn quickly, for he is the hope of us all.

1910
02:26:03,090 --> 02:26:04,850
他的眼睛 雪亮着呢
His eyes are open.

1911
02:26:05,560 --> 02:26:08,750
教他念书的老师 眼睛也应该这么雪亮
Make sure that the one who teaches him has his eyes open also.

1912
02:26:12,430 --> 02:26:16,030
我们会找到这样的老师的 我们刚找到他们
We will do that. We do it now.

1913
02:26:16,530 --> 02:26:18,130
带上你的孙子吧 爹
Take your grandchild with you.

1914
02:26:20,910 --> 02:26:23,370
是的 爹 带上他
Yes, my father, take him with you.

1915
02:26:31,150 --> 02:26:33,450
好好照顾他 教导他
Care for him and teach him.

1916
02:26:34,590 --> 02:26:35,880
他会跟我亲生的一样的
He will be as our own.

1917
02:26:36,050 --> 02:26:39,450
他本来就是你的亲生孙子啊
What else? For that is what he is.

1918
02:26:43,660 --> 02:26:48,060
于是老凌头把土地甩在脑后
So it came about that while Ling Tan left the land behind him...

1919
02:26:48,230 --> 02:26:50,330
他并没有失去希望
... he did not leave hope.

1920
02:26:50,500 --> 02:26:53,400
他把希望寄托在未来的一代 小玉的孩子身上
For he carried it with him in Jade's child.

1921
02:26:53,570 --> 02:26:57,300
这个小孩才是真正的龙种
That child so truly,the seed of the dragon.
