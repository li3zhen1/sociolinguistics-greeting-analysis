00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,917
来吧。快点。
C'mon. Hurry up.

00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:52,000
坏蛋!帮帮我!
Wretch! Help me out!

4
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,333
快去找个人。
Run and find someone.

5
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:07,000
帮助我。难道你看不出我做不到吗?哎哟!
Help me. Don't you see I can't make it? Ouch!

6
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:11,583
哎哟!噢,天哪!一定是坏了。
Ouch! Oh jeez! It must be broken.

7
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:19,000
哎哟!
Ouch!

8
00:05:20,042 --> 00:05:23,500
不!停止它!你在干什么?白痴!让我来吧!
No! Stop it! What are you doing? Idiot! Let me do it!

9
00:05:24,292 --> 00:05:26,500
运行……快去找个人。
Run... run and find someone.

10
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:35,542
去……去,快。快!
Go... go, quick. Quick!

11
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:46,792
你还在等什么?
What the hell are you waiting for?

12
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,000
快点!走吧!
Hurry Up! Go!

13
00:06:02,167 --> 00:06:06,917
你还在等什么?你没看见我快死了吗?
What are you waiting for? Don't you see I'm dying?

14
00:06:09,917 --> 00:06:12,000
你听不见我说话吗?
Can't you hear me?

15
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:31,917
看看有多少血。
Look how much blood.

16
00:06:35,542 --> 00:06:37,958
多少血啊。
How much blood.

17
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,750
停止。你不能从这里经过。-谁在乎?
Stop. You can't go through here. - Who cares?

18
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,375
你一定在乎。回来。
You must care. Get back.

19
00:08:25,167 --> 00:08:28,417
怎么从这里走呢?
How can one go through here?

20
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:32,708
多么糟糕的除夕夜!来吧，转过身来。
What a shitty New Year's Eve! C'mon, turn around.

21
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:38,042
他来了。在那里。你能看见他吗?
Here he is. Over there. Can you see him?

22
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:41,000
这是他。现在小心点!一件容易的事。
It's him. Be careful now! Easy.

23
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:43,083
容易……
Easy...

24
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,042
来吧!——哎呀!
C'mon! - Ouch!

25
00:08:45,042 --> 00:08:47,875
进车里，安静点。闭上你的嘴。
Get in the car and be quiet. Keep your mouth shut.

26
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:51,542
安静!不要害怕。我们不会对你做什么。
Quiet! Don't be afraid. We won't do anything to you.

27
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:54,583
别伤害他。
Don't hurt him.

28
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,917
给他戴上眼罩。
Get a blindfold for him.

29
00:09:27,042 --> 00:09:29,708
我们快点吧。
Let's hurry up.

30
00:09:30,292 --> 00:09:32,542
不要害怕。
Don't be afraid.

31
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:35,750
嘿!他什么都能看见。来吧，把他的眼罩弄平。
Hey! He can see everything. C'mon, set his blindfold right.

32
00:09:36,417 --> 00:09:38,750
好的。快。我们走吧。
Ok. Quick. Let's go.

33
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:45,000
来吧。快。小声点。帮助我。快点。
C'mon. Quick. Keep the noise down. Help me. Hurry up.

34
00:09:48,042 --> 00:09:50,833
就像爬到各各他一样。-闭嘴，混蛋。
It's just like climbing to Golgotha. - Shut up, asshole.

35
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,417
把门关上。
Close the door.

36
00:09:58,417 --> 00:10:00,833
别紧张。
Just take it easy.

37
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:04,750
别担心。
Don't worry.

38
00:13:08,917 --> 00:13:10,583
但是你们有祸了，大地和海洋!< / i >
<i>But woe to you, earth and sea!</i>

39
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:15,958
你悲伤的时刻到了!当魔鬼降临到你身上时……</i>
<i>Your grieving time has come! As the Devil has come down to you...</i>

40
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,417
…他非常愤怒，因为他知道他只有很短的时间了
...in <i>great fury, since he knows he has but a short time.</i>

41
00:13:18,917 --> 00:13:22,000
当龙看到自己被扔到地上时
<i>When the dragon saw that it had been thrown down to the earth...</i>

42
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:24,833
…如果我开始追求那个女人
...it <i>started to pursue the woman...</i>

43
00:13:25,167 --> 00:13:27,083
<我>…这个男孩是谁生的
<i>...who had given birth to the male child.</i>

44
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,208
我喜欢你，你知道的。我爱你们所有人。
I like you, you know. I love you all.

45
00:13:32,208 --> 00:13:35,500
我喜欢你说话的方式。我喜欢你的穿着。
I like the way you talk. I like the way you dress.

46
00:13:35,792 --> 00:13:40,875
他也不错。但是我想说……他还不完整。
He's not bad too. But I'd say...he's not complete.

47
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:45,167
他还不完整。
He's not complete.

48
00:13:56,292 --> 00:13:58,708
在这里。
Here.

49
00:13:59,917 --> 00:14:02,625
好的。他现在看起来好多了。
Ok. He looks better now.

50
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,417
我现在更喜欢他了。更多!
I like him more now. Much more!

51
00:14:05,542 --> 00:14:08,458
你想要牧师?他来了，等着你。
You wanted a priest? Here he is, ready for you.

52
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:11,125
你现在必须付清你的赌注。
You have to pay off your bet now.

53
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:14,583
谁把他打扮得像个牧师?
Who has dressed him like a priest?

54
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:18,250
他揭开了第六印，于是发生了大地震
<i>He broke open the sixth seal and there was a great earthquake.</i>

55
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:21,125
<i> >太阳变得像黑色的麻布和…</i>
<i>The sun turned as black as dark sackcloth and...</i>

56
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:25,833
…整个月亮变得像血一样。天上的星星…</i>
...the <i>whole moon became like blood. The stars in the sky...</i>

57
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:29,500
<我>…像未成熟的无花果被摇散一样落在地上
<i>...fell to the earth like unripe figs shaken loose...</i>

58
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:32,333
<i>…在强风中从树上掉下来。</i>
<i>...from the tree in a strong wind.</i>

59
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,833
你是谁?是谁?
Who is this? Who is?

60
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:49,292
<i>第一个，最后一个，活着的那个。</i>
<i>The first one, the last one, the one who lives.</i>

61
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:04,958
你还需要我吗?
Do you still need me?

62
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,833
你只需要一个牧师来玩吗?
Do you need just a priest to play?

63
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:17,625
<i bbb >他的脸，他的头发像羊毛或雪一样白
<i>His face, the hair of his head were as white as wool or as snow.</i>

64
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:22,625
不。现在我没心情了。
No. Now I'm not in the mood anymore.

65
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:25,875
我不想!我不再要了!
I don't want to! I no longer want!

66
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:33,208
在那时候，人要求死，却寻不著死
<i>During that time men will seek death but will not find it.</i>

67
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:37,750
他们渴望死亡，但死亡会逃离他们
<i>They will long to die but death will escape them.</i>

68
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:43,000
蝗虫的样子就像准备打仗的马
<i>The appearance of the locusts was like that of horses ready for battle.</i>

69
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,875
在他们的头上，他们戴着看起来像金冠的东西
<i>On their heads they wore what looked like crowns of gold...</i>

70
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:49,750
<我>…他们的脸就像人类的脸
<i>...and their faces were like human faces.</i>

71
00:15:50,417 --> 00:15:52,625
他们的头发就像女人的头发
<i>And they had hair like women's hair...</i>

72
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,500
<我>…他们的牙齿就像狮子的牙齿
<i>...and their teeth were like lions' teeth.</i>

73
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,583
他们的胸部像铁胸甲
<i>They had chests like iron breastplates.</i>

74
00:15:58,917 --> 00:16:05,042
[i bbb]它们翅膀的声音就像许多马车的声音
<i>The sound of their wings was like the one of many horse-drawn chariots...</i>

75
00:16:05,167 --> 00:16:07,708
<我>…冲进战场。他们有像蝎子一样的尾巴
<i>...racing into battle. They had tails like scorpions.</i>

76
00:16:07,958 --> 00:16:12,417
它们的尾巴有能力伤害人类长达5个月之久
<i>With their tails they had power to harm people for five months.</i>

77
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:15,208
<i bbb >他们有深渊天使作他们的王
<i>They had as their king the angel of the abyss...</i>

78
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:17,500
<我>…他的名字在希伯来语里是亚巴顿。< / i > . .
<i>...whose name in Hebrew is Abaddon.</i> ..

79
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:20,542
<我>…在希腊语中是Apollyon.</i>
<i>...and in Greek Apollyon.</i>

80
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:24,917
说得好!
Well said!

81
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:31,000
你至少可以为自己辩护或者寻求帮助，神父。
You could have defended yourself at least or asked for help, Father.

82
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:33,125
或者试图逃跑。
Or tried to escape.

83
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,833
你为什么不这么做，神父?
Why didn't you do that, Father?

84
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:41,958
你为什么不这么做?
Why didn't you do that?

85
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:52,000
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

86
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,958
我不知道。
I didn't know.

87
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:06,000
现在把鞋穿上。它是凉的。
Wear your shoes now. It's cold.

88
00:17:07,417 --> 00:17:09,958
我在那里谁也不认识。
I didn't know anybody there.

89
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:13,750
但刚开始的时候很有趣。
But it was fun when it started.

90
00:17:14,667 --> 00:17:18,000
但是你被冻住了。来吧，我们跑一跑。
But you're frozen. C'mon, let's make a run.

91
00:17:41,167 --> 00:17:44,000
你现在感觉好点了吗?——是的。
Do you feel better now? - Yes.

92
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,958
我有点累了。
I'm a little bit tired.

93
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:50,125
你要相信我，我很抱歉……
You have to believe me, I'm so sorry for...

94
00:17:50,333 --> 00:17:52,750
哦，不，毕竟是我的错。
Oh no, it's my fault, after all.

95
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:55,500
我真不知道我为什么会在这里。
I really don't know why I've found myself around here.

96
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,833
也许你想一个人待着。
Perhaps you wanted to be alone.

97
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:01,500
午夜时分你扔掉了什么?
What did you throw away around midnight?

98
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:06,708
哦,没什么。人们仍然坚持向窗外扔东西。
Oh, nothing. People still insist on throwing stuff out the windows.

99
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:11,958
他们相信明年的情况会好得多。
They're convinced that things will go better and much better next year.

100
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,250
反正我也不相信。
Well, I don't believe it, anyway.

101
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:22,833
嘿，看那儿!-是牧师!
Hey, look there! - It's a priest!

102
00:18:24,667 --> 00:18:27,667
Ring-a-ring-0“玫瑰…
Ring-a-ring-0'-roses...

103
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:43,458
我希望这对你来说真的是更好的一年。
I hope that it will be really a better year for you.

104
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:49,000
我能对牧师许什么愿呢?
What can I wish for a priest?

105
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,083
回去找你的朋友吧。
Get back to your friends.

106
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,542
我为什么要这么做?
Why should I?

107
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,875
现在我只是不想。
Now I just don't want to.

108
00:19:14,833 --> 00:19:17,000
我的兄弟姐妹们，在庆祝神圣的奥秘之前……
My brothers and sisters, before celebrating the sacred mysteries...

109
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,042
…让我们想起我们的罪。
...let's call to mind our sins.

110
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:21,750
我向全能的上帝忏悔，也向你忏悔……
I confess to almighty God, and to you...

111
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,333
…我的兄弟姐妹们，我因自己的过错而有罪……
...my brothers and sisters, that I've sinned through my own fault...

112
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:26,958
…在我的思想中，在我的言语中，在我的所作所为中……
...in my thoughts and in my words, in what I've done...

113
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,500
…还有我没能做到的事
...and in what I've failed to do.

114
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,292
我请求圣母玛利亚，永远的处女，所有的天使……
And I ask blessed Mary, ever virgin, all the angels...

115
00:19:31,292 --> 00:19:34,417
…圣徒们，还有你们，我的兄弟姐妹们，请为我祈祷。
...and saints, and you, my brothers and sisters, to pray for me.

116
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:31,000
愿主与你们同在。-你也一样。
The Lord be with you. - And also with you.

117
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,292
让我们祈祷吧。
Let us pray.

118
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:34,458
主啊，我们把你仆人夏娃的灵魂托付给你……
We commend to you, Lord, the soul of your servant Eve...

119
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,083
…这样她就能活在你的身体里…
...so that she can live on in you after this life...

120
00:22:37,083 --> 00:22:40,333
…她因人性的弱点而犯下的罪恶……
...and the sins she committed through human weakness...

121
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,333
…可以被你的仁慈所宽恕。
...can be forgiven by your mercy.

122
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,583
借着我们的主耶稣基督。——阿门。
Through our Lord, Jesus Christ. - Amen.

123
00:22:57,042 --> 00:22:59,875
我已经叫你不要再来了。
I had asked you not to come again.

124
00:23:01,167 --> 00:23:03,667
但我必须见到你。
But I had to see you.

125
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,708
我永远地离开了他们。
I left them forever.

126
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:10,250
为什么?
Why?

127
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:14,458
我讨厌他们所有人。
I hate them all.

128
00:23:16,083 --> 00:23:18,708
我想要忘记。
I want to forget.

129
00:23:25,542 --> 00:23:28,500
逃跑有什么意义?
What's the point of running away?

130
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:31,750
你永远也逃不掉了。从来没有
You will be never able to run away. Never

131
00:23:31,792 --> 00:23:34,125
你无处可去。
There's no place where you can go.

132
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:37,083
你没有希望了。
There's no hope for you.

133
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,875
他们伤害了你这么多。
They have hurt you so much.

134
00:23:39,917 --> 00:23:42,375
他们夺走了你的一切。
They have taken everything from you.

135
00:23:42,417 --> 00:23:44,750
有一天，为了拯救你自己…
And one day, to save yourself...

136
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:47,250
…也许你会被迫杀人。
...maybe you'll be forced to kill.

137
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:50,500
杀死……
To kill...

138
00:24:34,042 --> 00:24:36,667
我看到她进来过。
I've seen she's got in here.

139
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,875
嘿，你在干什么?我们在找你。
Hey, what are you doing? We were looking for you.

140
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,125
来吧，我们走吧。-回到我们身边。这是一座教堂。
C'mon, let's go away. - Come back to us. This is a church.

141
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:44,250
你不知道吗?来吧!我们走吧。-不过她喝醉了。
Don't you know? C'mon! Let's go. - She's drunk, though.

142
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:46,917
她喝得烂醉如泥。你喝醉了。——不!
She's dead drunk. You're drunk. - No!

143
00:24:46,917 --> 00:24:50,542
你进不去，你喝醉了。停!——不!别烦我!
You can't get in, you're drunk. Stop! - No! Leave me alone!

144
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:53,458
走开!
Go away!

145
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,458
你所爱的人死后，我埋葬了他们。
I buried your loved ones when they died.

146
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:27,000
你儿子出生时我给他们施了洗。
I baptized your sons when they were born.

147
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,458
当你们说彼此相爱时，我加入了你们的婚姻。
I joined you in marriage when you said you love each other.

148
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:35,125
我听到了你的罪恶，却无法帮助你。
And I heard your sins, without being able to help you.

149
00:25:36,667 --> 00:25:41,458
今天……我试着向你忏悔。
Today...I've tried to confess to you.

150
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:45,250
但我不知道我能不能做到。
But I don't know if I could do it.

151
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:48,583
我不知道这是否可能。
I don't know if it's possible.

152
00:25:49,625 --> 00:25:52,375
我想告诉你关于我的一切……
I wanted to tell you everything about me...

153
00:25:53,083 --> 00:25:57,833
…我觉得自己不配听到你的罪恶。
...and how I'm feeling unworthy of hearing your sins.

154
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:04,000
我是如何无力履行我的职责。
How I've been powerless to perform my duties.

155
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:13,458
我的感受……我还没决定我的任务有多重要。
How I've felt...been undecided about the importance of my mission.

156
00:26:15,917 --> 00:26:20,458
我希望我的最后一次布道会有所不同。
I was hoping that this last sermon of mine would be different.

157
00:26:22,375 --> 00:26:26,542
今天我要向你们告别，因为我要去一个新的教区了。
Today I say goodbye to you, as I will go to a new parish.

158
00:26:27,625 --> 00:26:30,000
我已经做了这个决定……
I've taken this decision...

159
00:26:30,042 --> 00:26:33,083
…因为我认为这样对你比较好……
...as I think it's better for you...

160
00:26:34,625 --> 00:26:37,333
…对我来说也是。
...and for me.

161
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:43,625
出于谦卑，我真的请求你试着理解我的话……
In all humility, I really ask you to try to understand my words...

162
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:46,458
…并原谅我。
...and to forgive me.

163
00:26:47,125 --> 00:26:51,250
我希望我值得你的理解……
I hope I've deserved your comprehension...

164
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:55,125
…感谢我们在一起这么多年。
...for all the years we have been together.

165
00:26:57,417 --> 00:27:00,667
我想我找不到合适的词来形容……
I think I'm unable to find the right words...

166
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:06,500
…在福音里…而我在自己身上找不到。
...in the gospel...and I can't find them in myself.

167
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:12,292
我知道我该说什么。
I know what I should say.

168
00:27:12,292 --> 00:27:16,792
但我也知道……我永远不会说的。
But I also know that... I will never say it.

169
00:27:21,667 --> 00:27:25,292
今天我决定离开你，因为……
Today I've decided to leave you because...

170
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:29,292
…我害怕我的责任。
...I'm afraid of my responsibility.

171
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:34,875
因为我意识到我帮不了你。
Because I realize that I can't help you.

172
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:43,458
因为我给不了你你给我的爱。
Because I couldn't give you the same love you gave me.

173
00:27:45,792 --> 00:27:49,458
我想说出真相，但我失败了。
I wanted to tell the truth but I failed.

174
00:27:49,750 --> 00:27:53,833
我试着跟你谈谈基督教的爱……
I tried to talk to you about Christian love...

175
00:27:53,875 --> 00:27:56,500
…但我的话听起来很假。
...but my words sounded fake.

176
00:27:56,542 --> 00:27:59,125
我为此感到羞愧。
And I felt ashamed of that.

177
00:27:59,792 --> 00:28:02,958
就像你对自己的罪恶感到羞耻一样。
Just like you feel ashamed of your sins.

178
00:28:04,333 --> 00:28:06,958
当牧师可不容易。
It's not easy to be a priest.

179
00:28:09,792 --> 00:28:13,917
在一个掺假的世界里，这并不容易……
It's not easy in a world where things are adulterated...

180
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:19,917
…真相被扭曲了。
...and the truth is distorted.

181
00:28:21,042 --> 00:28:24,083
这就是为什么今天的人们……
That's just why today people...

182
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:29,500
…当然，还有你们大多数人，你们简单、坦率、忠诚……
...and also most of you, of course, who are simple, frank and faithful...

183
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,458
…被怀疑所麻痹。
...are paralyzed by doubt.

184
00:28:34,333 --> 00:28:39,458
怀疑是人类本性和生活的一部分。
Doubting is part of human nature and life by now.

185
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,250
每个人都必须避免孤独……
Everyone has to avoid loneliness...

186
00:28:46,583 --> 00:28:49,042
…和其他人在一起。
...and to be together with the others.

187
00:28:49,042 --> 00:28:51,458
因为孤独的人对任何事都有怀疑。
Because a lonely man has doubts about anything.

188
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:54,083
甚至关于上帝。
Even about God.

189
00:28:54,542 --> 00:28:57,458
所以很难帮助他。
And so it's hard to help him.

190
00:28:58,167 --> 00:29:01,500
当一个人失去了自己的信仰……
When a man loses his own faith...

191
00:29:01,958 --> 00:29:04,750
…他甚至不相信自己。
...he doesn't even believe in himself.

192
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:08,458
他很快就变得虚弱了。
He becomes weak soon...

193
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:10,917
…他的肉体控制了他。
...as his flesh takes control.

194
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,708
他迷了路，不知不觉中……
He loses his way and without knowing it...

195
00:29:13,708 --> 00:29:17,958
…走到哪儿也去不了，还迷路了。
...takes the road to nowhere and gets lost.

196
00:29:24,167 --> 00:29:26,542
我知道，这些只是混淆的词语。
These are only confused words, I know.

197
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:29,875
我试着告诉你我的真实感受。
I've tried to tell you what I'm really feeling.

198
00:29:30,083 --> 00:29:34,208
现在我都不知道我这么做是为你好还是为我好。
And now I don't even know if I did it for my or your good.

199
00:29:35,542 --> 00:29:39,167
就是这样。请原谅我。原谅我。
That's it. Forgive me, please. Forgive me.

200
00:30:02,958 --> 00:30:05,458
在这里见到我你感到惊讶吗?
Are you surprised to see me here?

201
00:30:08,167 --> 00:30:10,542
我都不知道……
I don't even know...

202
00:30:12,292 --> 00:30:15,292
…我为什么回来，为什么回来
...why I'm back and what's for.

203
00:30:16,958 --> 00:30:19,875
我只知道我累了……
I only know I'm tired...

204
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:25,875
…厌倦了逃避。我总是这么做。它总是没用的。
...tired of running away. I always do it. It's always useless.

205
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:28,917
但你能理解我，不是吗?
But you can understand me, can't you?

206
00:30:30,625 --> 00:30:34,417
因为你也做不到。
Because you can't make it either.

207
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:38,917
你说对了。你承认了。
You said it. You admitted it.

208
00:30:39,458 --> 00:30:42,375
我太累了。
I'm so tired.

209
00:30:42,417 --> 00:30:44,750
我喝醉了，你看到了吗?
And I'm drunk, you see?

210
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:47,208
我很困惑。
I'm so confused.

211
00:30:47,292 --> 00:30:49,000
然后我来到这里……
Then I came here...

212
00:30:49,083 --> 00:30:51,292
…我听了你的布道
...and I heard your sermon.

213
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:55,583
我听了。我得到了。
I listened to it. And I got it.

214
00:30:56,750 --> 00:31:01,042
但那不是牧师的布道。
But it wasn't a sermon by a priest.

215
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,208
你知道为什么吗?
Do you know why?

216
00:31:03,333 --> 00:31:07,375
因为你不是牧师。
Because you're not a priest.

217
00:31:07,417 --> 00:31:11,083
你只是半个牧师，不完全是。
You're only half a priest, not entirely.

218
00:31:14,083 --> 00:31:17,125
我说得对吗，父亲?
Am I right, Father?

219
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:19,750
不要和我争论……
And do not argue with me...

220
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:22,875
…因为你得听我的。
...because you have to listen to me.

221
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,958
你必须这么做，即使你不想这么做。
You have to, even if you don't want to.

222
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:31,792
因为那是你的工作。
Because that's your job.

223
00:31:35,125 --> 00:31:38,500
倾听每个人的意见。每一个人。
Listening to everyone. Everyone.

224
00:31:40,750 --> 00:31:42,875
多么荒谬的……
How absurd...

225
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,500
…和无用……
...and useless...

226
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:49,083
多么愚蠢……
How stupid...

227
00:31:51,708 --> 00:31:54,542
我在这里做什么?
What am I doing here?

228
00:31:54,583 --> 00:31:57,458
你能告诉我我会变成什么样子吗?
Can you tell me what will become of me?

229
00:31:57,542 --> 00:31:58,833
我会喝酒。
I can drink.

230
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:02,042
我很擅长喝酒，你知道的。
Well, I'm good at drinking, you know.

231
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:04,917
然后和我喜欢的人上床。
Then I sleep with whoever I like.

232
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:09,500
我和我喜欢的人上床。
And I sleep with whoever I like.

233
00:32:10,292 --> 00:32:12,958
怎么了，神父?你感到震惊吗?
What's up, Father? Are you shocked?

234
00:32:13,875 --> 00:32:16,625
没有爱我活不下去。
I can't live without love.

235
00:32:16,792 --> 00:32:19,833
我去不了。
I can't make it.

236
00:32:19,917 --> 00:32:22,042
即使我了解男人。
Even if I know men.

237
00:32:22,083 --> 00:32:25,250
我确实认识他们。
And I do know them.

238
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:30,917
我不是妻子……
I'm not a wife...

239
00:32:31,042 --> 00:32:34,208
…我不是妓女……
...I'm not a whore...

240
00:32:34,250 --> 00:32:36,750
…我什么都没有。
...I'm nothing.

241
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:46,875
是的，你说得对。
Yes, you're right.

242
00:32:47,167 --> 00:32:48,875
我是对的。
And I'm right.

243
00:32:49,042 --> 00:32:50,625
每个人都是对的。
And everyone's right.

244
00:32:50,708 --> 00:32:53,250
我在旋转自己…
And I'm spinning myself...

245
00:32:53,250 --> 00:32:56,000
…就像风车一样。
...like a pinwheel.

246
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:58,458
我已经不知道该如何停下来了。
I no longer know how to stop.

247
00:32:58,708 --> 00:33:00,958
谁能阻止我?
How can one stop me?

248
00:33:01,042 --> 00:33:03,417
只能靠喝酒。
Only by drinking.

249
00:33:03,833 --> 00:33:06,250
我可能会自杀。
I might try to kill myself.

250
00:33:10,125 --> 00:33:12,542
你觉得呢?
Well, what do you think?

251
00:33:15,417 --> 00:33:16,708
你不相信我。
You don't believe me.

252
00:33:16,833 --> 00:33:19,792
你不想相信我!
You don't want to believe me!

253
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:23,083
你听过多少次这样的忏悔，神父?
How many confessions like this have you listened to, Father?

254
00:33:23,125 --> 00:33:27,208
有多少绝望的，小气的，伪装者的忏悔?
How many confessions by desperate, petty, pretender people?

255
00:33:27,458 --> 00:33:29,750
你为什么要听他们的?
Why are you listening to them?

256
00:33:29,875 --> 00:33:32,417
是的，当然，他们需要帮助。
Yes, sure, they need help.

257
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:35,625
你说得对，但我和他们不一样。我变得更糟。
You're right but I'm not like them. I'm worse.

258
00:33:35,708 --> 00:33:37,625
你知道为什么吗?
And you know why?

259
00:33:37,792 --> 00:33:40,625
因为我什么都不在乎。
Because I care about nothing.

260
00:33:40,708 --> 00:33:42,417
这不是忏悔。
This is not a confession.

261
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:44,750
这些都不是我的罪。
And these are not my sins.

262
00:33:44,875 --> 00:33:46,708
这些都是别人犯的罪。
These are the sins by the others.

263
00:33:46,750 --> 00:33:49,208
那是他们的狗屎。
That's their shit.

264
00:33:53,375 --> 00:33:55,458
是的,当然。
Yes, sure.

265
00:33:55,708 --> 00:33:58,375
你也是个男人。
You're a man too.

266
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,875
一个和其他男人一样的男人。
A man like all the other men.

267
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,917
一个穿着黑色衣服的小个子男人……
A little man dressed in black...

268
00:34:09,792 --> 00:34:11,875
…他什么都不懂。
...who understands nothing.

269
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:14,417
什么都没有。
No nothing.

270
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:18,500
你现在打算做什么?你会把我赶出去的，是吗?
What are you going to do now? You will kick me out, won't you?

271
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,500
哦，当然，毕竟这对你来说很容易。
Oh, sure, it's easy for you, after all.

272
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:26,042
你只需要保持温暖，锁在你的小房间里祈祷。
You just need to stay warm, locked in your little room and pray.

273
00:34:27,125 --> 00:34:33,417
祈祷，祈祷，祈祷……祈祷,祈祷……
Pray, pray, pray. . . pray, pray...

274
00:34:41,042 --> 00:34:43,958
你曾经爱过谁吗?
Have you ever loved anybody?

275
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,875
来吧，告诉我真相。
C'mon, tell me the truth.

276
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,250
好了，别害羞。
C'mon, don't be ashamed.

277
00:34:49,333 --> 00:34:52,167
你爱过真正的女人吗?
Have you ever loved a real woman?

278
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:01,042
爱是很难的。很努力。
It's very hard to love. Very hard.

279
00:35:03,083 --> 00:35:06,292
这几乎是不可能的。
It's almost impossible.

280
00:35:10,958 --> 00:35:16,292
但你在你的讲坛上和我们谈论爱。
But you talk to us about love from your pulpit.

281
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,667
这是给你的。
That's for you.

282
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:35,833
我偷的。
I stole it.

283
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:38,375
从你的教堂。
From your church.

284
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:41,958
因为你要走了。
Because you're leaving.

285
00:35:53,667 --> 00:35:54,958
是的，他必须离开。
Yes, he must leave.

286
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,125
他必须这么做，因为他想这么做。
He must because he wants to.

287
00:35:57,208 --> 00:35:58,833
人们窃窃私语，议论纷纷。
People whisper and talk about it.

288
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:01,458
但是他们什么也不知道，因为他们只是些可怜的家伙。
But they know nothing, as they're just poor devils.

289
00:36:01,542 --> 00:36:03,875
相反，我知道。我什么都看到了。
Instead I know. I see everything.

290
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:07,000
不是因为上级，也不是因为共产党。
It's not because of the superiors or or even of the communists, you know.

291
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:09,625
事实并非如此。事实是他失去了信仰。
The truth is diffent. The truth is that he lost his faith.

292
00:36:09,708 --> 00:36:13,292
我知道牧师是怎样的人。
I do know how priests are.

293
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:15,250
但他和其他人不一样。
But he's different from the others.

294
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,958
他有胡子。喜欢我。
He has the beard. Like me.

295
00:36:17,958 --> 00:36:23,458
为什么?不是因为昨天，也不是因为今天，事实是他失去了信仰。
Why? It's not due to yesterday or today, the truth is that he lost his faith.

296
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,708
但我理解他。
But I understand him.

297
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,583
让我们以毛为例。
Let's take Mao for example.

298
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:29,625
我确实对毛很感兴趣。
I'm interested in Mao, indeed.

299
00:36:29,667 --> 00:36:31,000
我亲中。同意了。
I'm pro-Chinese. Agreed.

300
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,333
但我留在这里。
But I stay here.

301
00:36:32,417 --> 00:36:35,292
我是一名牧师，为教会服务。
I'm a sacriston and serve the church.

302
00:36:35,375 --> 00:36:37,208
再见。
Goodbye.

303
00:36:41,125 --> 00:36:43,250
再见。
Goodbye.

304
00:36:51,958 --> 00:36:53,250
再见,爸爸。
Goodbye, Father.

305
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:56,458
父亲，你就这样走了?这对我们所有人来说都是一个巨大的悲伤。
Father, you go away like this? It's a big sorrow for all of us.

306
00:37:01,917 --> 00:37:03,000
再见，我的儿子。
Goodbye, my son.

307
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:07,042
快点回来。你一直都很好。
Come back soon. You've been so good.

308
00:37:13,208 --> 00:37:16,417
再见,爸爸。
Goodbye, Father.

309
00:37:21,208 --> 00:37:24,417
再见,爸爸。祝你旅途愉快。
Goodbye, Father. Have a good trip.

310
00:37:29,792 --> 00:37:32,583
别忘了我们，父亲。
Do not forget about us, Father.

311
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:24,667
你又在忙什么?
What are you up to again?

312
00:38:24,750 --> 00:38:26,917
你想从我这里得到什么?
What do you want from me?

313
00:38:30,792 --> 00:38:33,458
别烦我!
Leave me alone!

314
00:38:33,708 --> 00:38:35,042
停止它!
Stop it!

315
00:38:35,042 --> 00:38:37,875
我再也受不了了!
I can't take it anymore!

316
00:38:44,875 --> 00:38:48,333
说实话，我对它也不满意。
To be honest, I haven't been happy with it either.

317
00:38:48,792 --> 00:38:50,750
你知道，我太老了。
You know, I'm too old.

318
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:54,167
这是一个让人无法满足的教区。
It's a parish which gives no satisfaction.

319
00:38:54,208 --> 00:38:56,000
几个人，周围没人。
A few people, nobody all round.

320
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,875
只有岛上的老监狱……
Only the old prison in the isle...

321
00:38:57,917 --> 00:39:00,083
…你偶尔会去的地方。
...where you go every once in a while.

322
00:39:00,125 --> 00:39:02,000
你知道，这很可悲。-真遗憾。
It's sad, you know. - What a pity.

323
00:39:02,042 --> 00:39:03,958
你会习惯的。
You'll get used to that.

324
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:05,750
另一方面，游客会来的。
Tourists will come, on the other hand.

325
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:09,667
他们来了，吃了，拍了照，买了汽油，然后又走了。
They come, eat, take pictures, get petrol and leave again.

326
00:39:09,708 --> 00:39:11,250
他们很匆忙。
They are in a hurry.

327
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:13,083
现在每个人都很着急。
Everyone's in a hurry by now.

328
00:39:13,167 --> 00:39:14,708
还有教会。
Also the Church.

329
00:39:14,792 --> 00:39:18,250
加油站。教会服务。
Service station. Service Church.

330
00:39:18,958 --> 00:39:22,833
是的，离婚，独身，抗议。
Yes, divorce, celibacy, protest.

331
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:26,417
左翼和右翼牧师。
Left-wing and right-wing priests.

332
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:30,208
理想危机。
Crisis of ideals.

333
00:39:35,125 --> 00:39:36,875
你需要跟上节奏。
You need to keep the pace.

334
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:39,167
等一会儿。我给你看样东西。
Wait for a while. I'll show you something.

335
00:40:15,792 --> 00:40:19,750
你觉得呢?一个超现代和自动化的教堂。
What do you think? An ultra-modern and automatic church.

336
00:40:22,083 --> 00:40:24,583
你不会发现它比我更糟。
You won't find it worse than me.

337
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:37,000
我就是不明白为什么人们跑得那么快。
I just can't get why people are running so fast.

338
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:42,375
看那边，每天至少发生两起车祸。
Look over there: at least two car accidents occur every day.

339
00:40:43,458 --> 00:40:45,958
还有很多新的交通标志已经安装好了。
And to say that many new traffic signs have been installed.

340
00:40:46,833 --> 00:40:49,250
我去为他们祝福。
I went and blessed them.

341
00:40:49,625 --> 00:40:52,042
这是没有用的。
It was useless.

342
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,833
他们像疯了一样不停地跑。
They keep on running like mad.

343
00:40:55,708 --> 00:40:58,583
速度，速度，速度……
Speed, speed, speed...

344
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:02,458
谁知道大家都跑到哪里去了?
Who knows where everyone's running?

345
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:58,167
我的灵魂不要列在罪人之列，我的性命不要列在流人血的人之列
<i>Let not my soul be numbered among sinners or my life among men of blood.</i>

346
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:02,458
他们的手中是邪恶的阴谋，他们的右手拿着金钱
<i>In whose hands are evil designs, and whose right hands take money.</i>

347
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:08,458
至于我，却要照我所行的正直而行。求你救我，怜恤我
<i>But as for me, I'll go on in my upright ways: be my saviour and have mercy on me.</i>

348
00:46:50,542 --> 00:46:53,333
这条船出租吗?
Is this boat for rent?

349
00:46:54,708 --> 00:46:56,833
我要去钓鱼。
I need to go fishing.

350
00:46:58,792 --> 00:47:02,750
好吧，你喜欢去哪儿就去哪儿。对我来说也是一样。
Well, go wherever you like. It's the same for me.

351
00:47:05,292 --> 00:47:07,500
但它不适合我。
But it's not for me.

352
00:47:07,583 --> 00:47:09,625
我不会打扰你的。
I won't bother you.

353
00:47:17,875 --> 00:47:20,542
我们走吧?
Shall we go?

354
00:48:41,292 --> 00:48:43,583
我们一定要走远吗?
Must we get far?

355
00:48:43,750 --> 00:48:45,792
你能划多久?
How long can you row?

356
00:48:46,667 --> 00:48:49,875
慢慢地直到黄昏。
Slowly even till dusk.

357
00:48:51,042 --> 00:48:54,708
我只是需要时不时地休息一下。
I just need to get some rest from time to time.

358
00:49:00,583 --> 00:49:03,583
你知道从来没有女人上过这艘船吗?
Do you know that no woman has ever been on this boat?

359
00:49:03,583 --> 00:49:05,750
这种事从没发生在我身上。
It never happened to me.

360
00:49:06,292 --> 00:49:08,458
只有鱼。
Only fishes.

361
00:49:08,667 --> 00:49:10,792
很奇怪，不是吗?
It's strange, isn't it?

362
00:49:10,792 --> 00:49:13,625
其实并不奇怪。
Not so strange, actually.

363
00:49:15,583 --> 00:49:17,625
时代变了。
Times have changed.

364
00:49:18,292 --> 00:49:20,708
现在鱼相当稀少。
Fish is pretty scarce by now.

365
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:23,792
渔民也是如此。
The same goes for fishermen too.

366
00:49:25,375 --> 00:49:27,792
你得将就一下。
You have to make do.

367
00:49:30,375 --> 00:49:32,792
你会睡吗?
Will you sleep?

368
00:49:42,833 --> 00:49:45,708
去做吧。
Go ahead.

369
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:50,792
一个人不能一边划船一边说话。
One can't row and speak at the same time.

370
00:49:52,667 --> 00:49:54,750
一个人会累的。
One will get tired.

371
00:49:56,458 --> 00:49:58,667
所以保持安静。
So keep quiet.

372
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:04,750
我们还得再往前走一点吗?
Do we have to keep going a little bit further?

373
00:50:07,250 --> 00:50:09,792
我们还得再往前走一点吗?
Do we have to keep going a little bit further?

374
00:50:26,708 --> 00:50:29,333
你不是本地人吧?
You're not from around here, are you?

375
00:50:34,750 --> 00:50:36,958
我逃脱了。
I escaped.

376
00:50:39,083 --> 00:50:41,792
从谁?
From whom?

377
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:46,292
我逃离了所有人。
I escaped from everybody.

378
00:50:46,667 --> 00:50:49,417
或者说几乎每个人都有。
Or almost from everybody.

379
00:50:52,375 --> 00:50:54,750
你是谁?
Who are you?

380
00:50:57,167 --> 00:51:00,750
假设我现在扮演的是渔夫。
Let's say that I'm playing the fisherman right now.

381
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:05,792
你在玩什么把戏?
What are you playing at?

382
00:51:33,250 --> 00:51:36,000
不要闭上眼睛。
Do not close your eyes.

383
00:51:38,333 --> 00:51:41,542
不要闭上眼睛……
Do not close your eyes...

384
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:54,542
不…不要关闭…
No... do not close...

385
00:52:47,208 --> 00:52:48,917
再次见到我你高兴吗，父亲?
Are you happy to see me again, Father?

386
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,500
我会说你是。
I'd say you're.

387
00:52:52,833 --> 00:52:54,708
不，你错了。
No, you're wrong.

388
00:52:54,792 --> 00:52:57,792
我已经告诉过你，我帮不了你。
I've already told you I can do nothing for you.

389
00:52:57,917 --> 00:53:01,333
你来是不对的。
It was wrong of you to come.

390
00:53:01,542 --> 00:53:04,542
如果我想认罪呢?
What if I would like to confess?

391
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:10,042
我承认那些改过自新并希望得到宽恕的人……
I confess those who are reformed and want to be forgiven...

392
00:53:10,042 --> 00:53:13,125
…而不是那些只想找个共犯的人。
...not those only looking for a partner in their sins.

393
00:53:13,292 --> 00:53:16,583
但你得听我说，神父。
But you have to listen to me, Father.

394
00:53:17,875 --> 00:53:20,708
我听了很多像你这样的女人的忏悔……
I listened to the confessions by many women like you...

395
00:53:21,042 --> 00:53:25,333
…女人感到孤独、被抛弃……
...women feeling alone, abandoned, ...

396
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:29,625
…被剥削，绝望，无法活下去。
...exploited, hopeless, unable to keep on living.

397
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:35,083
你觉得自己是个特例，和其他人一样。
And you think you're a special case, just like the others.

398
00:53:36,125 --> 00:53:37,375
你乐于受苦。
You're happy to suffer.

399
00:53:37,375 --> 00:53:41,792
悲伤让你觉得自己很重要，很独特。
Sorrow makes you feel important and unique.

400
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,250
试着诚实一点。
Try to be honest.

401
00:53:45,292 --> 00:53:47,667
你怕我。
You're afraid of me.

402
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:49,625
你为什么要从我身边跑开?
Why are you running away from me?

403
00:53:49,667 --> 00:53:52,333
你为什么要欺骗自己?
Why are you deceiving yourself?

404
00:53:54,125 --> 00:53:57,792
你知道你对我有多重要吗?
Are you aware of how important you're for me?

405
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,208
我和你在一起变得平和?
That I'm becoming peaceful together with you?

406
00:54:00,292 --> 00:54:02,708
我正在忘记我的过去。
And I'm forgetting my past.

407
00:54:03,625 --> 00:54:06,625
你知道，我非常敬重你。你相信我吗，父亲?
I hold you in such high esteem, you know. Do you believe me, Father?

408
00:54:06,708 --> 00:54:11,792
他们教会我相信。我得说你的感受与我无关。
They taught me to believe. I must say that your feelings don't concern me.

409
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:17,000
你很清楚我不得不离开多少亲爱的朋友。我爱的人。
You know well how many dear friends I had to leave. People I really loved.

410
00:54:17,042 --> 00:54:21,333
但我是被迫这样做的，因为我不能再继续撒谎了!
But I was forced to do that, as I no longer could keep on lying!

411
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,417
我必须重新找回自我。
I have to find myself again.

412
00:54:23,458 --> 00:54:26,708
我不能给任何人任何东西!
And I can't give anyone anything!

413
00:54:26,833 --> 00:54:29,125
不，这不是真的。
No, it's not true.

414
00:54:29,167 --> 00:54:33,208
你来这里不是为了重新找回自我，而是为了逃避真实的自己。
You aren't here to find yourself again, but to escape from what you're.

415
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:35,000
为了躲避自己……
To hide from yourself...

416
00:54:35,042 --> 00:54:37,833
…因为你不想存在!
...because you'd like not to exist!

417
00:54:39,792 --> 00:54:42,083
我们永远不可能相互理解。
It will be never possible that we understand each other.

418
00:54:42,167 --> 00:54:44,917
你是女人，我是牧师。
You're a woman and I'm a priest.

419
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:48,083
不，不是为了这个。
No, it's not for this.

420
00:54:49,292 --> 00:54:52,958
我们不会因为我是女人就互相理解……
We won't understand each other just because I'm a woman...

421
00:54:53,083 --> 00:54:55,583
…而你是个男人。
...and you a man.

422
00:54:56,750 --> 00:54:59,208
没什么好说的了。
There's nothing else to say.

423
00:54:59,458 --> 00:55:01,792
我什么都说了，什么也看不见了。
I've said everything and can't see anything else.

424
00:55:01,875 --> 00:55:05,542
像这样继续。
Go ahead like this.

425
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:08,708
就像你一直做的那样。
Like you've been doing so far.

426
00:55:08,875 --> 00:55:13,542
足够了。我看不见了。现在我累了。
Enough. I can't see anymore. Now I'm tired.

427
00:55:13,792 --> 00:55:16,958
你也是。
And you too.

428
00:56:43,708 --> 00:56:45,125
我打扰你了吗?
Am I bothering you?

429
00:56:45,208 --> 00:56:47,083
你在祈祷吗?
We re you praying?

430
00:56:47,167 --> 00:56:49,292
不，我只是在想。
No, just thinking.

431
00:56:49,292 --> 00:56:52,083
跪着?
On your knees?

432
00:56:52,958 --> 00:56:57,000
多年来我一直跪着祈祷。
I've been always praying on my knees for years.

433
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:02,250
但有时我停止祈祷。
But I stopped praying sometimes.

434
00:57:02,417 --> 00:57:04,208
那时我开始思考。
And I was starting to think at that point.

435
00:57:04,583 --> 00:57:08,833
所以现在，即使我只想思考，我也得跪下来。
So now, even if I only want to think, I've to go down on my knees.

436
00:57:11,208 --> 00:57:13,958
你在想我吗，父亲?
Were you thinking about me, Father?

437
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:22,625
小心，离开那里，你会摔倒的。
Careful, away from there, you might fall down.

438
00:57:28,958 --> 00:57:31,125
再说一遍。
Say it again.

439
00:57:32,458 --> 00:57:34,958
以同样的方式。
In the same way.

440
00:57:36,708 --> 00:57:38,833
小心。
Careful.

441
00:57:40,375 --> 00:57:43,250
远离那里。
Away from there.

442
00:57:44,667 --> 00:57:47,292
你可能会摔倒。
You might fall down.

443
00:57:50,417 --> 00:57:53,250
你很好。
You're good.

444
00:57:53,625 --> 00:57:56,208
你在等我，对吧?
You were waiting for me, weren't you?

445
00:57:56,833 --> 00:57:58,792
来吧，说出来。
C'mon, say it.

446
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:05,917
愿平安与你同在。
The peace be with you.

447
00:58:05,958 --> 00:58:08,042
还有你。
And also with you.

448
00:58:29,542 --> 00:58:33,208
你相信看手相的人吗?
Do you believe in palmists?

449
00:58:33,667 --> 00:58:36,292
当我还是个孩子的时候……
When I was a child...

450
00:58:36,333 --> 00:58:38,417
…一个吉卜赛女人向我母亲预言有一天……
...a gypsy woman predicted to my mother that one day...

451
00:58:38,417 --> 00:58:41,208
…我会变得富有。
...I would become rich.

452
00:58:41,583 --> 00:58:44,542
很富有。很多钱。
Very rich. Lots of money.

453
00:58:47,708 --> 00:58:49,833
真是个错误。
What a mistake.

454
00:58:50,167 --> 00:58:52,292
所以，从那时起……
So, since that time...

455
00:58:52,792 --> 00:58:55,208
…我不再相信这些东西了。
...I haven't believed in these things anymore.

456
00:58:56,500 --> 00:58:58,000
相反，我相信。
I believe, instead.

457
00:58:58,167 --> 00:59:00,417
我相信一切。
I believe in everything.

458
00:59:00,583 --> 00:59:04,625
我相信黑猫，相信咖啡桌被撞……
I believe in a black cat, in a coffee table being hit...

459
00:59:05,292 --> 00:59:07,208
…我害怕吸血鬼
...and I'm afraid of vampires.

460
00:59:07,292 --> 00:59:11,250
你什么也看不懂，它们只是一些混乱的线条。
There's nothing you can understand there, they are only confused lines.

461
00:59:11,417 --> 00:59:14,208
这不是真的。
That's not true.

462
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:16,292
不过那个吉普赛女人说得对。
Oh, that gypsy woman was right, though.

463
00:59:16,375 --> 00:59:19,917
我也看到了丰富，非常丰富。
I also see richness, a great richness.

464
00:59:20,958 --> 00:59:23,250
这是你的救命稻草。
Here's your lifeline.

465
00:59:23,250 --> 00:59:25,750
这是幸福线。
This is the line of happiness.

466
00:59:25,833 --> 00:59:29,917
幸福的线真的很深。
The line of happiness is really very deep.

467
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:33,208
这是心线。
And that's the line of heart.

468
00:59:33,417 --> 00:59:39,083
心的那一段很长很长。
The one of heart is very very long.

469
00:59:39,792 --> 00:59:45,125
看，它往下，往下，往下……
See, it goes down, down, down...

470
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:47,125
…直到这里。
...until here.

471
00:59:55,292 --> 00:59:56,458
你知道这句谚语吗?
Do you know this saying?

472
00:59:56,458 --> 01:00:00,250
智慧是你的姐妹，谨慎是你的朋友。
Wisdom be your sister and prudence your friend.

473
01:00:34,833 --> 01:00:38,125
我们为什么要躲起来?
Why do we have to hide?

474
01:00:39,083 --> 01:00:41,833
有时候很有趣。
It's funny sometimes.

475
01:02:04,208 --> 01:02:05,625
你为什么把我带到这里来?
Why have you brought me just here?

476
01:02:05,750 --> 01:02:08,125
过来一下。
Come here a minute.

477
01:02:20,708 --> 01:02:22,250
那又怎样?
So what?

478
01:02:22,292 --> 01:02:24,208
我想带你看看我出生的地方。
I wanted to show you where I was born.

479
01:02:24,250 --> 01:02:26,000
在罗马斗兽场?
At the Colosseum?

480
01:02:26,875 --> 01:02:29,792
不，在那边。你能看到那个十字路口吗?
No, over there. Can you see that crossroads?

481
01:02:30,208 --> 01:02:31,458
没有,在哪里?在右边?
No, where? On the right?

482
01:02:31,583 --> 01:02:34,292
不，左边第二个。——是的。
No, the second one on the left. - Yes.

483
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:58,292
晚上好。你想吃什么?
Good evening. What do you want to eat?

484
01:02:59,417 --> 01:03:02,583
那你今晚就吃我给你带来的吧。
Well, so you'll eat what I bring you this evening.

485
01:03:02,958 --> 01:03:06,292
我要做点好吃的，真正的特色菜。
I'll give something tasty, a true speciality.

486
01:03:06,292 --> 01:03:09,250
专为情侣做的菜。
A dish made especially for lovers.

487
01:03:10,792 --> 01:03:15,958
要不要来点好吃的，真正的特色菜，为情侣特制的菜?
Will you have something tasty, a true speciality, a special dish for lovers?

488
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:20,500
你为什么那么固执?
Why were you so stubborn?

489
01:03:20,833 --> 01:03:23,250
你穿那条裙子真好看。
You look great in that dress.

490
01:03:23,458 --> 01:03:26,292
我很喜欢你。
I like you so much.

491
01:03:26,958 --> 01:03:30,250
我也很高兴今晚能来到这里。
I'm also very happy to be here tonight.

492
01:03:32,708 --> 01:03:35,292
我又饿又渴。
I'm hungry and thirsty.

493
01:03:35,292 --> 01:03:39,250
我也很高兴我不用在加油站吃饭。
I'm also very happy that I don't have to eat at the service station.

494
01:03:44,542 --> 01:03:46,375
有什么事吗?
What's up?

495
01:03:46,375 --> 01:03:49,292
不要回头。
Do not turn around.

496
01:03:58,167 --> 01:04:00,292
谁在那里？
Who's there?

497
01:04:01,667 --> 01:04:04,292
没关系。
It doesn't matter.

498
01:04:31,375 --> 01:04:33,458
你很好。
You're good.

499
01:04:33,500 --> 01:04:35,917
我们走吧。
Let's go.

500
01:05:08,500 --> 01:05:10,625
我们还没有付帐。
We haven't paid the bill.

501
01:05:10,625 --> 01:05:13,208
我们下次再去。
We shall go there another time.

502
01:06:38,208 --> 01:06:40,250
她死了。
She's dead.

503
01:07:05,167 --> 01:07:07,333
你是牧师吗?
Are you a priest?

504
01:07:11,667 --> 01:07:14,250
不，我不是。
No, I'm not.

505
01:07:50,083 --> 01:07:53,292
把车开到车库去。
Take the car to the garage.

506
01:07:56,958 --> 01:07:59,250
然后上来。
Then come up.

507
01:09:17,875 --> 01:09:20,292
转身……
Turn around...

508
01:09:20,792 --> 01:09:23,292
看着我……
Look at me...

509
01:09:23,333 --> 01:09:26,292
不要害怕……
Don't be afraid...

510
01:09:30,042 --> 01:09:32,292
转身……
Turn around...

511
01:09:32,542 --> 01:09:34,958
看着我……
Look at me...

512
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:37,292
不要害怕……
Don't be afraid...

513
01:09:37,542 --> 01:09:40,292
不要害怕……
Don't be afraid...

514
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:46,292
你不必……
Yo don't have to...

515
01:10:08,125 --> 01:10:09,750
太迟了。
It's too late.

516
01:10:09,875 --> 01:10:12,292
我不再年轻了。
I'm not young anymore.

517
01:10:13,375 --> 01:10:16,917
我现在已经无法改变我的生活了。
I can no longer change my life by now.

518
01:10:19,250 --> 01:10:22,917
我每天晚上都感到恐惧和痛苦。
I'm always feeling fear and anguish every night.

519
01:10:23,208 --> 01:10:24,750
一切都让我害怕。
Everything scares me.

520
01:10:24,875 --> 01:10:27,208
不，不是所有的，但是……
No, not everything, but...

521
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,750
…事情将如何发展，直到……
...how things will be till...

522
01:10:30,750 --> 01:10:36,292
…直到最后。我预见每一刻，每一天。
...till the end. I foresee every moment, every day.

523
01:10:37,833 --> 01:10:41,292
没有出路了。
There's no way out.

524
01:11:33,167 --> 01:11:34,500
你真漂亮。
You're so beautiful.

525
01:11:34,542 --> 01:11:39,125
喜欢总是。就像往常一样，你突然出现了。
Like always. And, like always, you come up all of a sudden.

526
01:11:39,292 --> 01:11:40,667
你知道我为什么来吗?
Do you know why I've come?

527
01:11:40,667 --> 01:11:41,875
不，一点也不。
No, not at all.

528
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:43,667
假设我可以想象它。
Well, let's say that I can imagine it.

529
01:11:43,792 --> 01:11:48,958
你需要钱，所以你回到了谷仓。
You need money and so you head back to the barn.

530
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,250
当我需要的时候，我会问你的。
When I need it, I will ask you.

531
01:11:52,917 --> 01:11:54,750
很好。
Very well.

532
01:11:54,833 --> 01:11:58,250
如果不是为了钱，那又怎样?
And if it's not about the money, so what?

533
01:12:02,125 --> 01:12:06,208
不，我只是想让你下定决心同意我离婚。
No, I just want you to make up your mind and grant me a divorce.

534
01:12:08,208 --> 01:12:10,750
毕竟，这对你来说只是个价格问题。
It's just a matter of a price for you, after all.

535
01:12:10,875 --> 01:12:14,208
当然!只是价格的问题。
Sure! Just a matter of a price.

536
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:18,917
你让我付出了很多，所以我没有理由要失去你。
You has cost me a lot, so there's no reason why I'd have to lose you.

537
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,292
不，一件珍贵的东西不能就这样浪费掉。
No, a precious object is not to be wasted like that.

538
01:12:22,292 --> 01:12:25,292
此外，你必须考虑到我对你的感觉，即使是现在。
Moreover, you must consider what I feel for you, even now.

539
01:12:25,333 --> 01:12:28,292
拜托，拜托。
Please, come on.

540
01:12:33,375 --> 01:12:39,208
不管怎样，这还不是全部。
That's not all, anyway.

541
01:12:40,042 --> 01:12:41,833
还有另一个原因。
There's another reason.

542
01:12:41,917 --> 01:12:45,167
当我遇见你的时候，你是我的替补。
When I met you, you were a third string.

543
01:12:45,167 --> 01:12:47,292
我是说你什么都不是。
I mean you were nothing.

544
01:12:47,833 --> 01:12:50,458
我把你介绍给重要人物。
I've introduced you to important people.

545
01:12:50,458 --> 01:12:53,292
我用我的爱创造了你……
I've made you with my love...

546
01:12:53,875 --> 01:12:56,458
…还有我的钱。
...and with my money.

547
01:12:56,500 --> 01:12:59,000
为什么?这不是真的吗?
Why? Isn't that true?

548
01:13:00,750 --> 01:13:04,208
这就是我恨你的原因，你很清楚。
That's just why I hate you and you know it very well.

549
01:13:04,583 --> 01:13:07,042
是这个原因吗?真的吗?
Is this the reason? Really?

550
01:13:07,042 --> 01:13:09,000
是的，就是这样。
Yes, that's it.

551
01:13:10,042 --> 01:13:12,250
你从没想过把我看得很高。
You never wanted to think highly of me.

552
01:13:12,583 --> 01:13:15,292
我一直都是你的玩具。
I've always been a toy for you.

553
01:13:15,792 --> 01:13:18,208
因为我喜欢你那样。
Because I liked you like that.

554
01:13:22,125 --> 01:13:24,250
你真是无与伦比。
You're really inimitable.

555
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:29,292
那你有什么建议?
Well, what are you proposing?

556
01:13:29,833 --> 01:13:32,542
我知道我们有进展了。
I see that now we're getting somewhere.

557
01:13:33,667 --> 01:13:37,208
好吧，我的建议是。
Well, here's my proposition.

558
01:13:37,542 --> 01:13:39,875
我们同意离婚。
We will agree with the divorce.

559
01:13:39,917 --> 01:13:43,292
唯一的条件是你要成为我的爱人。
The only condition is that you'll become my lover.

560
01:13:44,000 --> 01:13:45,917
现在你是我的妻子……
Now you're my wife...

561
01:13:46,167 --> 01:13:48,708
…你有很多情人。
...you have got many lovers.

562
01:13:48,875 --> 01:13:51,292
然后你就会成为另一个男人的妻子，但是……
Then you'll be the wife of another man but...

563
01:13:51,917 --> 01:13:53,417
…你要和我睡。
...you will sleep with me.

564
01:13:54,917 --> 01:13:56,417
这很合理，不是吗?
It's reasonable, isn't it?

565
01:13:58,250 --> 01:14:00,292
你真让我恶心。
You make me sick.

566
01:14:03,708 --> 01:14:07,292
但我爱你……代替。
But I love you... instead.

567
01:14:14,542 --> 01:14:17,667
因为男人不是由女人而来的
<i>For man did not come from woman...</i>

568
01:14:17,667 --> 01:14:20,708
<我>…但是女人来自男人。</i>
<i>...but woman from man.</i>

569
01:14:20,708 --> 01:14:23,875
男人也不是为女人而创造的，</i>…
<i>Nor was man created for woman,</i> ...

570
01:14:23,958 --> 01:14:26,958
<我>…但是女人对男人。</i>
<i>...but woman for man.</i>

571
01:14:27,625 --> 01:14:33,500
因此，女人的头上应该有一个男人权威的标志，</i>…
<i>Hence a woman should have a sign of authority of man on her head,</i> ...

572
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:37,125
<我>…因为天使。</i>
<i>...because of the angels.</i>

573
01:14:37,167 --> 01:14:42,083
另一方面，女人也不是独立于男人之外的
<i>On the other hand, woman is not independent of man...</i>

574
01:14:42,083 --> 01:14:45,875
<我>…或在主里的男人或女人。</i>
<i>...or man of woman in the Lord.</i>

575
01:14:45,958 --> 01:14:48,208
因为正如女人是从男人而来的
<i>For just as woman came from man...</i>

576
01:14:48,208 --> 01:14:51,083
<我>…所以男人是由女人所生的
<i>...so man is born of woman.</i>

577
01:14:56,708 --> 01:15:00,250
万物都是出于神
<i>And all things are from God.</i>

578
01:15:02,125 --> 01:15:03,708
你能划多久?
How long can you row?

579
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:06,292
我不知道。
I don't know.

580
01:15:14,542 --> 01:15:18,292
我打赌这是圣经里的话。
I bet it was a quote from the Bible.

581
01:15:19,708 --> 01:15:23,292
圣保罗写给哥林多人的第一封信。
From St. Paul's First Letter to the Corinthians.

582
01:15:23,292 --> 01:15:26,292
就是这样。
That's it.

583
01:15:29,042 --> 01:15:31,208
再见!
Goodbye!

584
01:16:16,708 --> 01:16:20,000
我忘了告诉你我游泳游得很好。
I forgot to tell you that I'm a very good swimmer.

585
01:19:31,458 --> 01:19:33,708
今天早上刚抓到的。
Just caught this morning.

586
01:19:33,708 --> 01:19:37,208
是的，就像我以前在市场上买的鱼一样。
Yes, like the fish I use to buy at the market.

587
01:19:44,375 --> 01:19:47,208
你知道，这里很好。
It's nice here, you know.

588
01:19:47,500 --> 01:19:51,250
你打算在这间公寓里住很长时间吗?
Are you going to stay in this apartment for a long time?

589
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:55,250
我必须再见到你。-你疯了!
I had to see you again. - You crazy!

590
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:56,292
别烦我。
Leave me alone.

591
01:19:56,292 --> 01:19:58,417
你在我的脑海里挥之不去。
You're stuck in my head.

592
01:19:58,417 --> 01:20:00,125
事情本不必这样结束的……
It didn't have to end like this...

593
01:20:00,125 --> 01:20:01,833
到这里来。
Come here.

594
01:20:03,792 --> 01:20:05,833
走开!-别动。
Go away! - Stay still.

595
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:08,000
我再也不想了!- - - - - -什么? !
I no longer want to! - What?!

596
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:11,167
我不想!——安静。
I don't want to! - Quiet.

597
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:16,250
我说不!
I said no!

598
01:21:03,583 --> 01:21:06,292
她也是你的女人吗?
Is she your woman too?

599
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:13,292
我，你和她。所以我们有三个人。
Me, you and her. Hence there's three of us.

600
01:21:16,208 --> 01:21:19,792
你这个笨蛋!白痴!
You dumb ass! Idiot!

601
01:21:19,875 --> 01:21:23,292
我已经和她睡过了!她想要我。
I've been already sleeping with her! She wanted me.

602
01:21:23,375 --> 01:21:25,708
你明白吗?
Do you understand that?

603
01:21:25,708 --> 01:21:28,708
她想要我!我都不用问她。
She wanted me! I didn't even have to ask her.

604
01:21:29,125 --> 01:21:31,292
她是惊人的。
She's amazing.

605
01:21:31,708 --> 01:21:34,292
她像女神一样做爱。
She makes love like a goddess.

606
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:45,250
你这个哭哭啼啼的绿帽子。
You crying cuckold.

607
01:21:50,833 --> 01:21:53,042
他是对的。
He's right.

608
01:21:53,167 --> 01:21:57,000
都是你的错。邪恶在你身上，你不想改变。
It's your fault. Evil is in you and you don't want to change.

609
01:21:57,042 --> 01:21:58,625
所以像你这样的女人永远不想改变!
So women like you never want to change!

610
01:21:58,625 --> 01:22:01,292
你们都是一样的!都一样!
You are all the same! All the same!

611
01:23:43,458 --> 01:23:46,292
我跟踪你来不是因为你说得对。
I didn't follow you here because you're right.

612
01:23:46,417 --> 01:23:48,542
不是那样的。
It's not like that.

613
01:23:48,708 --> 01:23:51,000
看着我。
Look at me.

614
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:57,167
好吧。
All right.

615
01:23:59,125 --> 01:24:01,208
所以我在这里等你。
So I'll wait for you here.

616
01:24:04,958 --> 01:24:09,250
欢迎您,爸爸。
Welcome, Father.

617
01:24:10,000 --> 01:24:12,083
进来。
Come in.

618
01:25:42,417 --> 01:25:45,250
嘿!听。
Hey! Listen.

619
01:25:45,333 --> 01:25:48,167
你有烟吗?
Do you have a cigarette?

620
01:26:01,917 --> 01:26:05,417
美丽的…
Beautiful...

621
01:26:06,500 --> 01:26:09,167
不，别走。
No, don't go away.

622
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:15,917
让我看看。-放开我!
Let me see it. - Let me go!

623
01:26:17,417 --> 01:26:20,000
等待。——不!
Wait. - No!

624
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:23,042
你要去哪里?——够了!
Where are you going? - Enough!

625
01:26:23,417 --> 01:26:26,042
等等!你要去哪里?
Wait! Where are you going?

626
01:26:27,792 --> 01:26:29,875
到这里来。
Come here.

627
01:26:59,250 --> 01:27:01,333
放开我!
Let me go!

628
01:27:30,750 --> 01:27:32,125
你在干什么，神父?
What are you doing, Father?

629
01:27:32,417 --> 01:27:35,500
把钥匙还给我。来吧!
Give back the keys. Come on!

630
01:28:17,375 --> 01:28:19,333
那是监狱里最古老的地方。
That's the oldest part of the prison.

631
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:21,750
它已经很多年没有被使用了。
It's hasn't been used for many years now.

632
01:28:22,208 --> 01:28:24,500
总有一天它会崩溃。
It will collapse one day.

633
01:28:24,667 --> 01:28:26,708
被判无期徒刑的囚犯住在这里。
Life sentenced prisoners stay here.

634
01:28:46,792 --> 01:28:49,792
原谅我。这几天我想了很多。
Forgive me. I've been doing a lot of thinking these past few days.

635
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,625
现在我要告诉你…
And now I have to tell you that...

636
01:28:54,583 --> 01:28:58,667
什么也别说。我知道这对你来说不可能。
Don't say anything. I know it's impossible for you.

637
01:28:59,833 --> 01:29:04,417
当你在讲坛上讲话时，你可以向你的奉献者谈论爱。
You can talk about love to your devotees, when speaking from the pulpit.

638
01:29:05,667 --> 01:29:08,250
但你不能对一个单身女人这么说。
But you can't tell that to a single woman.

639
01:29:12,292 --> 01:29:14,292
等待。
Wait.

640
01:29:14,375 --> 01:29:17,792
等一下。呆着别动!
Wait for a moment. Stay still!

641
01:29:27,542 --> 01:29:31,542
这很简单。那么简单。
It's so easy. So simple.

642
01:29:32,042 --> 01:29:35,542
每天都有数以百万计的人对彼此说这句话。
Millions of people say that to each other every day.

643
01:29:43,625 --> 01:29:46,208
不，我不能代替你说。
No, I can't say that instead of you.

644
01:29:46,375 --> 01:29:49,292
你必须这么说。
You have to say that.

645
01:30:28,500 --> 01:30:32,083
你找他干什么?你为什么总缠着他?放开他!
What do you seek of him? Why are you always stuck to him? Let him go!

646
01:30:32,250 --> 01:30:33,958
他不适合你!-我就是不明白。放开我!
He's not for you! - I just don't get it. Let me go!

647
01:30:33,958 --> 01:30:36,167
是的，你明白了。他是我儿子。
Yes, you do get it. He's my son.

648
01:30:36,167 --> 01:30:38,208
我和上帝的儿子，仅此而已!现在明白了吗?
My and God's son and nothing else! Got it now?

649
01:30:38,333 --> 01:30:41,375
他已经为我——他的母亲——做了牧师。他爱我。
He has become a priest for me, his mother. And he loves me.

650
01:30:41,792 --> 01:30:45,542
他曾经很快乐……平和快乐。
Once he was happy... Peaceful and happy.

651
01:30:45,750 --> 01:30:49,917
你为什么不放过他?我求你了。
Why don't you leave him alone? I beg you.

652
01:30:50,167 --> 01:30:56,500
小心，如果你毁了他或者你想这么做，我会杀了你，我有能力。
Beware, if you ruin him or if you want to, I'll kill you, I'm able to.

653
01:30:58,917 --> 01:31:01,667
你是个坏女人。
You're a bad woman.

654
01:31:08,125 --> 01:31:10,750
你是个坏妈妈。
And you're a bad mother.

655
01:31:51,542 --> 01:31:54,500
你会杀了我，不是吗?
You would kill me, wouldn't you?

656
01:31:54,583 --> 01:31:57,458
你是怎么猜到的?
How could you guess that?

657
01:31:57,500 --> 01:31:59,542
我了解你。
I know you.

658
01:31:59,583 --> 01:32:02,500
至少你会承认我是个听话的丈夫。
At least you'd acknowledge that I'm an obedient husband.

659
01:32:02,625 --> 01:32:05,250
你打电话给我，我就赶过来了。
You've called me and I've just rushed over here.

660
01:32:05,292 --> 01:32:08,750
你知道我差点就想你了吗?
You know that I've almost missed you?

661
01:32:19,250 --> 01:32:21,042
好吧，你愿意和我一起回去吗?
Well, will you come back with me?

662
01:32:21,125 --> 01:32:22,792
不，我不是必须成为你的爱人吗?
No, didn't I have to become your lover?

663
01:32:22,792 --> 01:32:24,708
什么时候?
When?

664
01:32:24,708 --> 01:32:27,708
即使是现在，如果你愿意。
Even now, if you want.

665
01:32:31,792 --> 01:32:33,417
我不相信你。
I don't trust you.

666
01:32:33,458 --> 01:32:36,167
我也不相信你。
I don't trust you either.

667
01:32:44,667 --> 01:32:45,917
我们要去哪里?
Well, where are we going?

668
01:32:45,958 --> 01:32:49,458
你说"在哪儿"是什么意思?当然是去你家了。
What do you mean "where"? To your place, of course.

669
01:32:49,458 --> 01:32:51,792
不是说好了吗?
Wasn't that the deal?

670
01:33:33,375 --> 01:33:37,583
哎哟!
Ouch!

671
01:33:58,583 --> 01:34:01,708
帮我一下。快。帮帮我。
Give me a hand. Quick. Help me out.

672
01:34:02,333 --> 01:34:06,792
我不能……我动不了了。
I can't... I can't move.

673
01:34:10,333 --> 01:34:12,792
你为什么只是站在那里?
Why are you just standing there?

674
01:34:13,208 --> 01:34:20,792
给别人打电话。难道你看不出我做不到吗?哎哟!该死的!
Call people or someone. Don't you see I can't make it? Ouch! Damn!

675
01:34:27,917 --> 01:34:30,292
你在干什么?哎哟!
What are you doing? Ouch!

676
01:34:30,417 --> 01:34:32,750
停止它!白痴!
Stop it! Idiot!

677
01:34:37,042 --> 01:34:39,708
寻求帮助。快点。
Ask for help. Hurry up.

678
01:34:40,833 --> 01:34:46,500
停车!做点什么!来吧!快……
Stop a car! Do something! Come on! Quick...

679
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:56,458
你在看什么?
What are you staring at?

680
01:34:56,542 --> 01:34:59,750
走吧!快跑!
Go! Run!

681
01:35:16,833 --> 01:35:22,125
你还在等什么?难道你看不见我快死了吗?
What the hell are you waiting for? Can't you see I'm dying?

682
01:35:36,333 --> 01:35:38,750
你听不见我说话吗?
Can't you hear me?

683
01:35:43,542 --> 01:35:46,750
看看有多少血。
Look how much blood.

684
01:35:50,292 --> 01:35:52,750
多少血啊……
How much blood...

685
01:36:29,708 --> 01:36:33,042
你想要什么?我不能忏悔你。
What do you want? I can't confess you.

686
01:36:33,625 --> 01:36:35,750
等待。我杀了我丈夫。
Wait. I've killed my husband.

687
01:36:40,042 --> 01:36:44,417
我的天啊。
Oh, my God.

688
01:36:51,833 --> 01:36:54,833
我都是为了你!对我们来说!我现在自由了!
I did that for you! For us! I'm free now!

689
01:36:54,833 --> 01:36:57,000
你该死，你犯了最严重的罪……
You're damned, you committed the worst sin...

690
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,250
我才不在乎呢!
I don't even care!

691
01:36:58,250 --> 01:37:00,292
别那样说，别那样说话。
Do not say that, do not talk like that.

692
01:37:00,333 --> 01:37:04,333
低下头。你能听到我说话吗?跟我念:我的错……
Bow your head. Can you hear me? Repeat after me: mea culpa...

693
01:37:04,417 --> 01:37:06,208
你就不能说点别的吗?
Can't you say anything else?

694
01:37:06,208 --> 01:37:07,875
闭嘴!不要亵渎!
Shut up! Don't blaspheme!

695
01:37:07,875 --> 01:37:10,792
我的错，我的错，我最大的错，我的错，我的错……
Mea culpa, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa, mea culpa, mea culpa...

696
01:37:10,792 --> 01:37:12,333
没用的!
It will be no use!

697
01:37:12,333 --> 01:37:13,542
求你不要折磨我。
Please, do not torment me.

698
01:37:13,542 --> 01:37:15,167
我不能赦免你。我不能原谅你。
I can't absolve you. I can't forgive you.

699
01:37:15,167 --> 01:37:16,333
我不能和你呆在一起。
I can't stay with you.

700
01:37:16,333 --> 01:37:18,583
上帝啊，宽恕我的罪过吧。
God, forgive my sins.

701
01:37:18,583 --> 01:37:20,417
你也原谅了我。
And you forgive me as well.

702
01:37:20,458 --> 01:37:22,333
主啊，在这试炼中帮助我。
Lord, help me in this trial.

703
01:37:22,333 --> 01:37:25,792
这样我就不会永远迷路了。主啊，请原谅我。
So that I won't get lost forever. Forgive me, Lord.

704
01:37:26,917 --> 01:37:30,542
主啊，听我的祷告。请不要拒绝我的帮助。
Lord, hear my prayer. Do not deny me your help.

705
01:37:30,583 --> 01:37:34,542
听我的召唤。我在这里只是短暂的客人。
Listen to my call. I'm your guest here only for a short time.

706
01:39:45,833 --> 01:39:48,667
让我们祈祷吧。
Let us pray.

707
01:39:58,708 --> 01:40:01,042
主啊，我既领受了……
Having received, o Lord...

708
01:40:01,042 --> 01:40:05,208
…救赎你的圣礼……
...the sacrament of your salvation...

709
01:40:05,250 --> 01:40:10,792
…我们恳求你，让圣母保佑我们吧。
...we beg you, let the Blessed Virgin of the Street protect us.

710
01:40:12,250 --> 01:40:16,792
我们总想留在他多情的保护下。
Under whose amorous protection we always want to stay.

711
01:40:20,792 --> 01:40:25,833
在她多情的保护下…我们总是想留下来。
Under whose amorous protection ...we always want to stay.

712
01:40:29,042 --> 01:40:34,708
在他的多情保护下，我们总是想要……
Under whose amorous protection we always want...

713
01:43:02,458 --> 01:43:05,208
你为什么不想爱我?
Why don't you want to love me?

714
01:43:05,375 --> 01:43:08,750
我爱你。就像我爱其他男人一样。
I love you. Like I love all the other men.

715
01:43:10,750 --> 01:43:12,792
你是个骗子。
You're a liar.

716
01:43:13,417 --> 01:43:16,333
你不可能以同样的方式爱每一个人。
You can't love everyone in the same way.

717
01:43:16,417 --> 01:43:20,000
你不可能像我爱你那样爱别人。
And you can't love the others in the same way I love you.

718
01:43:20,375 --> 01:43:22,792
你是亵渎神明的。
You're blasphemous.

719
01:43:37,042 --> 01:43:41,542
好的!够了!别再提这件事了。
Ok! That's enough! Let's say no more about it.

720
01:43:42,583 --> 01:43:45,083
我再也不会见你了。
Never again.

721
01:43:47,333 --> 01:43:49,583
你现在在干什么?
What are you doing now?

722
01:43:49,625 --> 01:43:50,833
我想去游泳。
I want to take a swim.

723
01:43:50,833 --> 01:43:52,500
不,请。
No, please.

724
01:43:52,500 --> 01:43:54,500
如果你怕我自杀，你也来吧。
If you're afraid I'll kill myself, you come too.

725
01:43:54,542 --> 01:43:56,375
拜托!别这么做!
Please! Don't do it!

726
01:43:56,500 --> 01:43:59,042
如果你愿意，你还是可以救我的。
You can still save me, if you want.

727
01:43:59,167 --> 01:44:01,667
你为什么不敢看我?
Why are you afraid of looking at me?

728
01:44:01,708 --> 01:44:03,708
你喝醉了。
You're drunk.

729
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:07,750
你很可笑。
And you're ridiculous.

730
01:44:08,417 --> 01:44:14,708
你是可笑的!一个可笑的牧师!一个可笑的人!
