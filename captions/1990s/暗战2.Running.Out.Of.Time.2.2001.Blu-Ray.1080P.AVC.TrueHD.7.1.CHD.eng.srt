1
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,952
Cat. Have Shan, KC and Avina call me.

2
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,952
Bye.

3
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,035
Hi, KC.

4
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,551
Did you draft the contract?

5
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,076
Great! Bring it to the meeting.

6
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,872
I'm on my way. Hold on.

7
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,351
Hello Shan.

8
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,914
I'll see you in half an hour.

9
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,752
Avina, make sure the financials are ready.

10
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:50,237
I have an announcement to make.

11
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,079
The meeting was a success.

12
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,231
We have reached an agreement with BIC.

13
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,391
When Mr. Lee comes here next week to sign,

14
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,079
we will have completed the merger.

15
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:59,753
What we need to review is their proposal

16
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,239
for a share swap merger.

17
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,914
But that's going to cost us 1 8% more.

18
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,908
And if the market changes,
it'll cost us even more.

19
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,999
The contract needs a lot of amendment,

20
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,515
we need a couple more drafts
before it's finalized.

21
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,791
We may not have the financials ready in time.

22
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:18,311
But if we get the PRC market share,
our profit will be very high.

23
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,154
Conservatively speaking,
we will net at least 5 billion.

24
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,550
Therefore we'll have to make it work.

25
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:27,628
You guys will have to slave it out
in the next few days.

26
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,871
By the way, in the last 2 weeks,

27
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,554
3 artifacts insured by us have been stolen.

28
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,957
The insured value is around 5 million.

29
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,878
We have someone verifying the claims.

30
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,951
Fine, approve their claims.

31
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,951
We don't need any distraction.

32
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,031
General...

33
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:37,316
I have a hot tip! Wanna order something?

34
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,717
Hear me out! A couple days ago

35
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,549
my friend took me to see the owner.

36
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,790
He's got a great horse!

37
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,076
People are watching...

38
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,238
That baby is a great performer,

39
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,994
Ioves a fast surface.

40
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,275
I couldn't believe my eyes...

41
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,711
That animal is the best sprinter!

42
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,553
It had the fastest time.

43
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,710
Next week...

44
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,552
Cut me a break.

45
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:07,871
Next week... I'll have it!

46
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,950
Friday!

47
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,509
I'll have the money!

48
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,710
Thursday!

49
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,357
How many times have you said that?

50
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:34,111
If no money, just jump off a building.

51
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,672
Assistant Commissioner.

52
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,949
Assistant Commissioner.

53
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:12,550
What are you doing here?

54
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,994
What about you?

55
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,274
- Morning.
- Morning.

56
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,789
What's all this?

57
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,999
What's the big deal with these burglary cases?

58
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,513
Your investigation hasn't picked up
a thing for 2 weeks.

59
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,113
It's a waste of taxpayer's money!

60
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,119
There may be a rat inside the insurance company.

61
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,357
Just because the art objects
are insured by the same company?

62
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,633
Know what "coincidence" means?

63
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,153
You're over-reading it.

64
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,794
Wrap up the investigation
if you don't hear anything.

65
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,995
I did.

66
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,277
Angelina rejected Mr. Unfulfilled again.

67
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,439
For the ninth time?

68
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,108
What's her name again?

69
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:46,912
"Angelina". Nosy!

70
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,510
It is my business!

71
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,555
I'm Assistant Commissioner Wong Kai Fa!

72
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,309
This is for you, Inspector.

73
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:04,909
No sender's address again?

74
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,149
Yes Sir.

75
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,829
This is the third one.

76
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,834
Is someone upset with you?

77
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,551
Be careful.

78
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,910
Leave me alone!

79
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:21,549
Don't say I did not warn you!

80
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,590
Yes.

81
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,957
Thursday, I know...

82
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,108
I... will have it.

83
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,756
Of course not!

84
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,999
Sure! After work! 7!

85
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:13,911
He wouldn't talk to us.

86
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,513
No idea who he is.

87
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,989
Thursday...

88
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,910
What?

89
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:21,393
Did you check if he lives around here?

90
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,396
We have nothing on him.

91
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:23,750
Thanks, Captain.

92
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:44,955
Mister.

93
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,630
Mister.

94
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,993
What's your name?

95
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:33,872
I'm Ken, the negotiator.

96
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,518
What's wrong? Can I help you?

97
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,553
Let's play a game first. Then I'll tell you.

98
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,076
Okay.

99
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,310
Head or tail?

100
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:49,316
Head.

101
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,876
Wrong.

102
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,556
Head or tail?

103
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,191
Come, let's play somewhere else.

104
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,315
You won't play?

105
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,834
No... Head!

106
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,669
Wrong.

107
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,150
Head or tail?

108
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,150
You thirsty?

109
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,551
We can get something for you.

110
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,873
You lost twice in a row. Don't you want to win?

111
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:21,276
Head!

112
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,279
Is that all you're going to say?

113
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,198
I have a 50/50 chance.

114
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,835
Let's see it.

115
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,357
Wrong.

116
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,953
You're kidding me.

117
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,077
Call your superior.

118
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:36,717
Yes, Captain!

119
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:37,915
Head!

120
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:38,951
Wrong.

121
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:39,916
Again!

122
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:43,717
Head!

123
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:44,592
Wrong.

124
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,590
Inspector Ho!

125
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,359
What are you doing here?

126
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,430
What about you?

127
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,232
I'm the negotiator.

128
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,118
What if the Commissioner wants a report on this?

129
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,395
I better have a look.

130
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,508
Fine. Just don't say a word up there.

131
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,669
Got it.

132
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,516
Inspector, something's wrong with your man.

133
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,636
He's been playing head or tail with our subject.

134
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,069
Give me a radio.

135
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:14,670
Inspector Ho.

136
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,869
Head!

137
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:19,996
Wrong.

138
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,230
Again!

139
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:26,756
Head!

140
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,116
Wrong.

141
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,430
Again!

142
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,198
This is Assistant Commissioner Wong Kai Fa!

143
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,271
How dare you, Ken!

144
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,672
You promised to shut up.

145
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:46,955
I couldn't stand it!

146
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,268
We don't know who the guy is.

147
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,358
I worry if Ken keeps losing

148
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,118
he'll jump off the building.

149
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,349
Why would he?

150
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,949
Yes he will!

151
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,355
We're bugged!

152
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,632
Ken's in great debt.

153
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,668
I'll talk to him

154
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:14,197
and grab him if there's a chance.
Notify the firemen.

155
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,709
Sure.

156
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,112
Inspector!

157
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,992
Don't curse!

158
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:30,150
I didn't!

159
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,955
"Looking for me? "

160
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,511
Head! No...

161
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,755
Head!

162
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:50,829
Wrong.

163
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,038
I'll toss!

164
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:57,513
See if you can win one out of three.

165
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,318
Don't fall for it!

166
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,754
I've been getting tail for 33 times, Inspector!

167
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,194
That's spooky.

168
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,120
It's just a game.

169
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:11,596
Quit if you're afraid losing.

170
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,553
It's just a game!

171
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,031
Remember what you came up here for?

172
00:13:16,760 --> 00:13:19,228
It'll show head. Let me win!

173
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:22,869
Head!

174
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,109
Wrong again.

175
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,239
You can't win.

176
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,195
He means you don't have the luck.

177
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,072
What do you want?

178
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,115
Two chances left.

179
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,115
Head!

180
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:04,631
It can't be... Thursday...

181
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,510
Last chance!

182
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,154
I'll toss!

183
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:14,830
Head or tail?

184
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,953
It doesn't matter who does it.

185
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,636
It's destiny.

186
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,789
Have some confidence, Ken. Head or tail?

187
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,390
Head!

188
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,119
You got it! Yes!

189
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:32,635
Don't lie to him.

190
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,791
I didn't. It's for real.

191
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,274
Come see it for yourself.

192
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:38,119
I don't tell lies.

193
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:39,870
Come.

194
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,949
You lost, Inspector.

195
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:53,630
It's tail.

196
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,632
Then come see it for yourself.

197
00:14:58,680 --> 00:14:59,954
So you can catch me?

198
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,272
You think you can get away?

199
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:04,510
Look at him.

200
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:09,036
Ken!

201
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,835
Bomb!

202
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:21,669
Why are you doing this?

203
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,869
You'll soon find out.

204
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,232
Calm down.

205
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:31,719
Call ambulance.

206
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:02,909
The pier please.

207
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:11,670
Where are you going?

208
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:13,876
The police station.

209
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:17,671
I'm charging you with aiding and abetting.

210
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,109
And setting trash cans on fire.

211
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,155
Sounds serious!

212
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,036
You're a smart guy, Inspector.

213
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,668
Didn't expect you to catch up with me.

214
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,429
It just happens. Every time I drive a taxi

215
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:34,269
I would pick up dumb bad guys.

216
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:35,869
No one would believe that.

217
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,439
I agree.

218
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:38,635
How about this

219
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,793
If I take you in, I win.

220
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,030
The station is far. It's not challenging.

221
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,155
How about the end of this block?

222
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,108
If you can drive me to
the end of the block, you win.

223
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:53,438
I won't stop no matter what!

224
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,395
Why did you call me?

225
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,874
Have the lab analyze the handkerchief.

226
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,309
There's a feather.

227
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,188
Take it too.

228
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,116
Calling center.

229
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:20,752
This is Assistant Commissioner Wong Kai Fa.

230
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,394
Teresa speaking.

231
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:40,789
The 3 stolen art objects are under my possession.

232
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,111
Are you interested in getting them back?

233
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,589
What do you want?

234
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,116
Notify Inspector Ho.

235
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,114
Have the money ready.

236
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,154
Call everyone to a meeting.

237
00:20:13,160 --> 00:20:15,390
I'll be there in 1 5 minutes.

238
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:24,319
We should contact the authority.

239
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,399
No. If BIC finds out our company
is being extorted

240
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:31,313
they'll walk out on the deal.
It's going to hurt us.

241
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,876
Not if the cops put a lid on the case.

242
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,632
That's the risk we can't take.

243
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,513
But we don't know who we're up against.

244
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,999
This is a criminal we're talking about.

245
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,833
What choice do we have?

246
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,912
There's only a few days left.

247
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:54,037
Let's keep this confidential people.
Proceed with your work as usual.

248
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,310
Shan, call Central Bank

249
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,918
Call now!

250
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:13,594
Jackson? This is Shan from PFA.

251
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,194
Teresa wants to speak with you.

252
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,709
Hello, Teresa

253
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:23,078
I need a favor. I need 20 million dollars
in cash right now.

254
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:29,710
You two go over there.

255
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,595
Who are you guys? Clean the office later.

256
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,795
Mr. Unfulfilled.

257
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,190
Who are you guys?

258
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:45,515
I'm a cop.

259
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,629
Let's have a chat.

260
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,713
You know what's going on.

261
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,878
I need to see the person in charge.
Please cooperate.

262
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,232
Shan, get going!

263
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,675
You're...Teresa?

264
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,748
I'm Inspector Ho.

265
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,957
Can we talk in your office?

266
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,635
It's not true.

267
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,594
I'm here to help.

268
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,955
I don't think I can help you.

269
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,670
Shan!

270
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:41,954
Excuse me.

271
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,591
"The 3 stolen art objects... "

272
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,634
"...are under my possession."

273
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:52,035
"Are you interested in getting them back? "

274
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,116
"What do you want? "

275
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,271
"20 million dollars."

276
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,429
"Is this a joke? "

277
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,633
"Then I'll make more scores
to get the media's attention."

278
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:01,951
"That'll scare your clients away."

279
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:03,714
"Have the money ready."

280
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:11,314
It's illegal to bug my office
without my permission.

281
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:16,272
Your best option is to work with us.

282
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,116
Understand?

283
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,438
I know my rights.

284
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,999
I don't have to report the case.

285
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:26,037
I know my rights too.

286
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,359
I can invite you to come down the station.

287
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:32,518
You can come in your own car
or we can send one over.

288
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,875
It's up to you.

289
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,350
Teresa please.

290
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:39,550
Who are you?

291
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,354
What do you want?

292
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,674
Who is this?

293
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,513
- Teresa?
- Yes.

294
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,829
Met Inspector Ho already?

295
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,195
Inspector Ho please.

296
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,877
You okay? Don't worry,
the smoke was not poisonous.

297
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:10,190
It's you!

298
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:14,752
Remember you asked me why I'm doing all this?

299
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:18,117
You said I'll find out later.

300
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,393
If I pick up the ransom, I win.

301
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:24,874
- Where? When?
- Where? When?

302
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,952
Tomorrow at 9 AM. The Inspector knows the place.

303
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:45,949
- Madam
- Yes

304
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:48,714
I have to get going.

305
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:54,750
Why?

306
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:03,510
Assistant Commissioner.

307
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:07,438
Please give this to Inspector Ho.
I was waiting for him.

308
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,510
Perfect.

309
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:09,636
Why ask you?

310
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,313
Listen to me.

311
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,919
Our suspect is at the station.
Seal off the premise now.

312
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,115
Make sure no one leaves!

313
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,838
- Thanks
- No problem

314
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,275
What?

315
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,915
Don't ask. Just do what I say!

316
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,795
Why do I have to do everything you said?

317
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,557
Back to the station!

318
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:27,755
Let's go get the money.

319
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,549
Remember what I told you on the phone?

320
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,909
Did you do it?

321
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,994
I couldn't make out what you were saying!

322
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:32,388
How was I supposed to understand?

323
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:35,068
Plus your friend was talking next to me.

324
00:26:35,240 --> 00:26:36,150
The one on the rooftop...

325
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,799
with long hair and mustache?

326
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:40,797
There is resemblance...

327
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:42,631
It is him!

328
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,677
He is the suspect!

329
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:46,671
I didn't know that.

330
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,831
Told you you weren't making any sense.

331
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,996
Inspector Ho! Here's 20 million!

332
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,309
Where's the drop-off place?

333
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,068
What 20 million? What drop-off place?

334
00:26:56,040 --> 00:26:58,235
- Write down the serial numbers.
- Yes.

335
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:04,195
All one thousand dollar bills.

336
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,237
500 bills per stack. Half a million.

337
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:08,870
Mr. Unfulfilled?

338
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,190
What?

339
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,079
Who is Angelina?

340
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,396
Central precinct. Please hold.

341
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,635
It's for you, Inspector.

342
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,076
Sorry it's me again.

343
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:40,911
What do you want?

344
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,392
Forget about real bills. I want color copies.

345
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:47,639
Make sure they are double-sided copies.

346
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,071
No problem. Any other requests?

347
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,390
No! Photocopying bank notes is illegal!

348
00:27:52,760 --> 00:27:53,909
Why color copies?

349
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,919
I'll take full responsibility.

350
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,753
How much do you really want?

351
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,797
Can you stop complicating things?

352
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,675
Of course not. Right, Inspector?

353
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:03,911
Yes.

354
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,750
That's exactly what he wants to do, Teresa.

355
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,234
Kiddo! This is Assistant Commissioner Wong Ka Fa!

356
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:15,114
Either make your demand or hang up now!

357
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,789
Assistant Commissioner please.

358
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:38,112
It's him!

359
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,311
Yes?

360
00:28:40,040 --> 00:28:42,156
Remember to give Inspector the envelope.

361
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,672
Otherwise he won't know
where to make the drop-off.

362
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,348
He'll have nowhere to go tomorrow.

363
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:48,273
I know.

364
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,955
What money?

365
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,998
Drop-off... 20 million...

366
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,753
Extortion?!

367
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:57,319
Why fake bills?

368
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,115
Wong Kai Fa!

369
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,354
Wong Kai Fa!

370
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,829
Wong Kai Fa!

371
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:34,949
Wong Kai Fa!

372
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:36,836
Did you touch my things?

373
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:39,355
Did you forget to give me something?

374
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,356
Do you have it on you?

375
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:41,869
Inspector Ho!

376
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,111
What?

377
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:54,911
Morning!

378
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,030
Morning!

379
00:31:57,240 --> 00:32:00,152
Great day today.

380
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,874
Had breakfast yet?

381
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,194
Ate already.

382
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,233
You sound upset.

383
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,516
Stayed up all night?

384
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,879
Or couldn't figure out the puzzle?

385
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:13,999
I can set a new date.

386
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,834
No. I'm dying to meet you.

387
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:18,755
Same here.

388
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:21,995
Know where to make the drop-off?

389
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,198
Yes. Figured it out last night.

390
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:26,830
See you soon!

391
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:27,750
Good.

392
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,273
You had me worried.

393
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,556
Why didn't you say so last night?

394
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,239
They look real.

395
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:39,792
We'll be in trouble if they're out on the streets.

396
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,359
What building is in gray?

397
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,073
With no windows?

398
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,389
Warehouse!

399
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,957
There's one like it in Chicago.

400
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,596
You should get going. Where to?

401
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,558
Thought you already knew.

402
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,317
Looks familiar.

403
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,515
Of course.

404
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,113
The trash can?

405
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,434
Why would this be the drop-off place?

406
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:53,277
Don't touch it!

407
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,156
What?

408
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:03,789
He's here for the money!

409
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:06,270
Keep calm!

410
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,429
Stay where you are!

411
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,993
This is Assistant Commissioner Wong Kai Fa.

412
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:11,993
We need backup! We have a crisis here!

413
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,031
We have bigger problems here!

414
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:17,228
An organized attack!

415
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,314
Keep an eye on the money!

416
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,318
Where are you, Mr. Unfulfilled?

417
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,309
Don't answer!

418
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,515
Hold your fire!

419
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:05,557
We didn't fire!

420
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,514
Wong Kai Fa!

421
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,757
I didn't carry my gun!

422
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,190
The money is gone!

423
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:15,879
No! I have it here.

424
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,794
The windows are intact.
We didn't have to evacuate.

425
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:16,309
Are these bills real or fake?

426
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,635
They're color copies.

427
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:21,679
We're in trouble!

428
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:37,511
He got away with the money!

429
00:37:56,200 --> 00:37:58,509
- Madam
- Madam

430
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,830
You two come with me.

431
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:08,113
The Commissioner wants to know what happened.

432
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:11,868
What should I tell him?

433
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:15,189
A suspect detonated smoke bombs here.

434
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,594
Only smoke.

435
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:20,591
The counterfeits are all over the streets.

436
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,718
I'll take full responsibility.

437
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,390
Take a vacation.

438
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,351
A vacation?

439
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,596
I've approved it.

440
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,393
Assistant Commissioner, you'll take over.

441
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,710
Yes, Madam.

442
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,753
Here's the lab's analysis of the handkerchief.

443
00:38:33,960 --> 00:38:35,029
Thank you.

444
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:40,357
You're on vacation. He'll handle it.

445
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,635
Take some time off.

446
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,068
See what you've done

447
00:38:57,080 --> 00:39:00,755
I'll have the money.

448
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,713
I will see if you do or not tomorrow

449
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:29,629
What?

450
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:53,434
One person?

451
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:08,313
Ready to order?

452
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,748
That day...

453
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:32,759
Did you play tricks on me?

454
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,435
Did you cheat?

455
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:53,955
Head or tail?

456
00:42:56,560 --> 00:42:57,390
Head!

457
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,594
Sorry.

458
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:25,673
Inspector Ho please

459
00:43:25,840 --> 00:43:27,558
Finish?

460
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,713
One more time.

461
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,789
Inspector Ho please.

462
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:34,829
Inspector Ho please.

463
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:40,716
It's not hard to imitate.

464
00:43:41,560 --> 00:43:42,834
"Inspector Ho please."

465
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:45,712
There she is... wait for my signal.

466
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:46,949
Okay.

467
00:43:57,560 --> 00:43:59,869
- Hi Teresa. Going home?
- What do you want?

468
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,029
I'm a cop.

469
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:02,958
Please give me a minute.

470
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:04,634
I've got new leads.

471
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:05,916
None of my business.

472
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:08,355
I gave him the money. It's over.

473
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:19,429
But think about it, Teresa.

474
00:44:19,640 --> 00:44:20,629
Why go through all the trouble?

475
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,637
Besides the trash can,

476
00:44:23,120 --> 00:44:24,519
he sent me two other things.

477
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:27,389
It's not over yet. He'll call you again.

478
00:44:27,640 --> 00:44:28,072
I can contact you superior!

479
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,834
If this guy can pick up money from your station,
what more can you do?

480
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:32,399
Listen to me...

481
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,316
What are you doing?

482
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:36,114
Sorry.

483
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:46,790
Teresa.

484
00:44:52,080 --> 00:44:53,798
Inspector Ho please.

485
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:12,955
This is he speaking.

486
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:15,913
I'm not afraid of you.

487
00:45:16,280 --> 00:45:18,840
Don't harass her over the phone!

488
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:35,669
We found feather on the handkerchief.

489
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,877
It belongs to American Bald Eagle.

490
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:40,029
It's not found in Hong Kong

491
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:42,350
Unless it's in captivity.

492
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:44,313
What does it mean?

493
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,795
If we find the eagle, we'll find its owner.

494
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:48,712
Could the feather belong to a specimen?

495
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,833
That's not what the lab says.

496
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:54,233
Where can we find it?

497
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,833
I've seen it!

498
00:45:56,320 --> 00:45:58,959
So that's why. I thought that eagle lost its way.

499
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,355
You observe wild birds?

500
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,597
I majored in ornithology in college.

501
00:46:03,040 --> 00:46:04,553
What is it?

502
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:07,992
"Ornithology". The study of birds.

503
00:46:09,840 --> 00:46:11,990
Last time I spotted the eagle by the harbor.

504
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:14,193
If I get my bird watching buddies

505
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,554
to the buildings around the area,

506
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,518
we'll be able to find the eagle!

507
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:24,390
A Grey Plover! It's a fat one!

508
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:27,400
Haven't seen one Tercel all day.

509
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:29,392
Didn't fall migration begin already?

510
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:31,114
Didn't you see the news?

511
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,397
Northern Japan is experiencing a heat wave.

512
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:40,399
Look at the sailboats!

513
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,069
Paul, what are you doing?

514
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,150
Sorry...

515
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:46,398
Black-faced Spoonbill! Can you see it?

516
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:49,833
It normally migrates to Taiwan,
hardly comes to Hong Kong.

517
00:47:50,080 --> 00:47:51,559
Did it lose its way?

518
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,829
It's beautiful...

519
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:54,319
Shan, what are you doing?

520
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:55,669
Sorry...

521
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:16,109
I see it!

522
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:23,640
Inspector, the eagle is heading
toward Bank of China. You see it?

523
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:28,350
Yes!

524
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:32,675
Teresa.

525
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:39,998
Get in, let's go.

526
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:47,159
- What are you doing?
- What?

527
00:48:47,560 --> 00:48:50,233
Don't lose the eagle!

528
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:00,829
Straight ahead!

529
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:02,396
That way!

530
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:06,350
That way!

531
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:13,909
It's gone!

532
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:17,278
I thought you kept your eyes on it.

533
00:49:19,920 --> 00:49:21,558
Shan, where is it?

534
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:27,870
I lost it.

535
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,549
How can you lose it? What the hell are you doing?

536
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,392
Fanny, do you see it?

537
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:33,555
It's behind the skyscraper.

538
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,755
It's flying too low.

539
00:49:34,920 --> 00:49:36,273
Should be around Queen's Road.

540
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:39,393
Open the sunroof and take a look.

541
00:49:56,240 --> 00:49:57,673
Do you see it?

542
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:00,833
Yes, it's there!

543
00:50:01,280 --> 00:50:03,589
Where? Left or right?

544
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:04,636
Left!

545
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,398
No... Right!

546
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:20,957
No, it turned that way!

547
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,395
Which way?

548
00:50:22,760 --> 00:50:23,749
That way!

549
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,234
Left or right?

550
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:26,669
That way like I told you!

551
00:50:39,640 --> 00:50:40,675
Which is left?

552
00:50:42,000 --> 00:50:43,797
Can you tell left from right?

553
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:46,115
You'll drive.

554
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:02,270
You first.

555
00:51:11,520 --> 00:51:12,953
Please hand me the binocular.

556
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,068
Please drive...

557
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:13,709
Please pull over.

558
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:20,035
Please wait here.

559
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:13,954
Throwing a concert?

560
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,954
Think you're Robin Hood?

561
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,199
You're just a thief!

562
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:48,433
No. I'm a magician who brings joy to people.

563
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:52,713
You got the wrong audience.

564
00:53:53,440 --> 00:53:56,034
I always hated magic shows.

565
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,119
They're fake.

566
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:02,158
I want you to be my assistant.

567
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,318
Every magician's got one.

568
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,718
Should I wear a sexy costume

569
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,752
and do the opening dance act?

570
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,235
That's not your role.

571
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:17,755
You're going to help me to finish this illusion.

572
00:54:18,560 --> 00:54:20,312
I prefer arresting you more!

573
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:58,599
Watch where you're going!

574
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:17,590
Water please.

575
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:18,715
5 dollars.

576
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:30,351
Ice cream please.

577
00:57:30,520 --> 00:57:31,555
5 dollars.

578
00:57:48,040 --> 00:57:49,359
Taking a stroll, Sir?

579
00:57:49,880 --> 00:57:50,869
I'm pursuing a suspect.

580
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:54,757
You're joking, right?

581
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,999
Inspector, your determination impresses me.

582
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:18,269
Thanks. I'll catch you no matter where you go.

583
00:59:20,560 --> 00:59:21,629
Finish line is the end of this road.

584
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,638
If I win, you'll come with me.

585
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,838
If I win, the game continues!

586
01:02:44,080 --> 01:02:46,878
Hi, Teresa.

587
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,756
We've talked before on the phone.

588
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:51,548
Nice to meet you.

589
01:02:53,560 --> 01:02:54,834
I have something for you.

590
01:03:45,040 --> 01:03:46,189
What is it?

591
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:49,314
He returned the money.

592
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:51,395
He gave it to you?

593
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,159
It was left in your car.

594
01:03:58,040 --> 01:03:58,950
Sit.

595
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:06,032
He raised the ransom to 1 00 million.

596
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:09,389
How did you know I was here?

597
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:11,594
He told me.

598
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:23,235
Ate already?

599
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:27,148
It's really late.

600
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:29,552
You told me to wait...

601
01:04:32,840 --> 01:04:33,829
Want one?

602
01:04:35,640 --> 01:04:37,153
One wonton noodle please.

603
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,711
BIC is going to sign on Friday.
We can't have any troubles.

604
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,199
Can you help me?

605
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:53,839
- We'll sign...
- understand.

606
01:04:57,080 --> 01:04:57,876
What do you want?

607
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,635
He wants you to deliver the ransom.

608
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:04,998
So I've become his assistant!

609
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,149
Your leg...

610
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:15,910
I'm sorry.

611
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:17,999
It's part of the job.

612
01:05:18,600 --> 01:05:19,749
You okay?

613
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,038
Call BIC as soon as I leave,

614
01:05:44,240 --> 01:05:45,673
tell them I'll arrive early.

615
01:05:45,880 --> 01:05:47,996
See if they can move up my meeting
with Lee Wen-Qi.

616
01:05:54,200 --> 01:05:55,155
Have a good trip.

617
01:05:55,920 --> 01:05:57,353
Keep your eyes on the company.

618
01:05:58,040 --> 01:05:59,359
I will, good luck!

619
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,713
Inspector Ho!

620
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:19,630
- Wait here.
- Yes sir

621
01:06:22,360 --> 01:06:23,554
The money doesn't matter.

622
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,155
Be careful.

623
01:06:58,240 --> 01:06:59,912
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

624
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:01,594
What did she say?

625
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:05,752
What's it to you? Nosy.

626
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:07,756
What?

627
01:07:12,640 --> 01:07:13,390
Morning!

628
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:14,197
Morning!

629
01:07:14,760 --> 01:07:16,796
Sorry to make you get up this early.

630
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:18,110
What now?

631
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:20,029
The money is pretty heavy.

632
01:07:20,280 --> 01:07:22,874
I got you a back pack to save you the trouble.

633
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:24,631
Where is it?

634
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:27,114
Figure it out yourself!

635
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,115
You have the key.

636
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:34,316
What is this?

637
01:07:38,440 --> 01:07:40,271
Why do you have my key?

638
01:07:40,640 --> 01:07:41,675
It's yours?

639
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:42,192
I recognize the key chain.

640
01:07:42,360 --> 01:07:45,272
I bought it last time when I went to Japan alone.

641
01:07:45,680 --> 01:07:46,510
What is it for?

642
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,274
My locker at the station.

643
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:35,754
Sorry.

644
01:08:48,320 --> 01:08:49,196
Head.

645
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:52,955
Again.

646
01:08:58,600 --> 01:08:59,635
Head.

647
01:09:03,080 --> 01:09:03,956
Again.

648
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:11,069
Head.

649
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:14,709
Hurry! You're not supposed to be here.

650
01:09:14,880 --> 01:09:15,710
Yes.

651
01:09:38,840 --> 01:09:42,389
"Triangle Garden"

652
01:09:53,680 --> 01:09:55,671
- Madam, I was just looking for you.
- Asst. Commissioner.

653
01:09:55,840 --> 01:09:57,159
I need your help on this.

654
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:01,115
Sergeant Lee wants to move to a new desk.

655
01:10:01,240 --> 01:10:02,355
He's superstitious...

656
01:10:02,560 --> 01:10:04,710
You have to see it for yourself.

657
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:06,154
But now Sergeant Chan is upset.

658
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,510
He claims it's bad Fong Sui.

659
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:09,715
The two are arguing everyday.

660
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:12,633
What should I do?

661
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:16,431
Inspector.

662
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:17,311
Morning.

663
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:19,837
What is it? What's in the bag?

664
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:24,113
I've been asked to deliver the ransom.

665
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,631
I knew you won't take time off.

666
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:30,315
Give me a report tomorrow.

667
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:31,550
Yes, Madam!

668
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,275
Inspector Ho.

669
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:37,316
Be careful.

670
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:46,839
What did she say?

671
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:50,231
She said you should be careful.
Don't make more troubles.

672
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:52,871
I thought you were on the lookout.

673
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:53,996
Where were you?

674
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:55,030
I...

675
01:10:55,320 --> 01:10:56,753
You're never reliable!

676
01:10:57,000 --> 01:10:57,830
Head.

677
01:10:59,240 --> 01:11:00,195
Wrong.

678
01:11:03,680 --> 01:11:04,715
Again.

679
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,195
Head.

680
01:11:10,680 --> 01:11:11,556
Wrong.

681
01:11:12,080 --> 01:11:12,990
Again.

682
01:11:14,760 --> 01:11:17,752
Wait, I have to make a call.

683
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,519
Sorry, Inspector,

684
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,074
I've changed my mind.

685
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:33,790
Say it.

686
01:11:34,040 --> 01:11:35,951
Be at Central at 1 1.

687
01:11:39,960 --> 01:11:41,359
Let's go!

688
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,233
Where to?

689
01:11:44,360 --> 01:11:45,588
Don't keep it a secret!

690
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,079
Central!

691
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:28,595
Head.

692
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:30,550
Wrong.

693
01:12:31,600 --> 01:12:32,396
Again.

694
01:12:37,400 --> 01:12:38,310
Head.

695
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:42,756
Wrong.

696
01:12:43,640 --> 01:12:44,834
Inspector Ho?

697
01:12:45,280 --> 01:12:45,757
Yes.

698
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,911
Party of nine? Your table is ready.

699
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:52,430
Head.

700
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:55,156
Again.

701
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:04,349
Again.

702
01:13:05,440 --> 01:13:08,193
Let's take a break.

703
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:09,949
Order something.

704
01:13:23,440 --> 01:13:25,954
Running around all morning,
should make you hungry.

705
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,112
Have lunch with your men.

706
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:31,359
The food here is good. Try it.

707
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:33,359
How considerate of you!

708
01:13:33,680 --> 01:13:35,033
Remember to pick up the bill for me!

709
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:38,913
Fine. Enjoy.

710
01:13:55,160 --> 01:13:55,990
So?

711
01:13:58,560 --> 01:13:59,675
Lunch break.

712
01:14:31,560 --> 01:14:33,551
Great food! I'll come here again.

713
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:44,030
Again.

714
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:48,549
Head or tails?

715
01:14:59,720 --> 01:15:01,073
How many times have we played?

716
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:08,231
372 times.

717
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:18,151
I lost 372 times.

718
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:27,239
Why keep playing?

719
01:15:31,640 --> 01:15:32,595
Right.

720
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:35,638
Why keep playing?

721
01:15:43,120 --> 01:15:44,269
Excuse me.

722
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:01,994
Bye

723
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:29,350
Finished?

724
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:32,913
Now it's time to take a stroll.

725
01:16:51,560 --> 01:16:53,232
Please make a donation.

726
01:16:57,680 --> 01:16:58,669
Thanks.

727
01:17:02,080 --> 01:17:03,832
Please make a donation.

728
01:17:12,080 --> 01:17:13,035
Thank you.

729
01:18:45,360 --> 01:18:47,669
So? Where to now?

730
01:18:48,120 --> 01:18:49,633
Are you afraid to show yourself?

731
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:51,677
It's late, I'm tired!

732
01:18:52,040 --> 01:18:53,792
What? You're upset?

733
01:18:53,960 --> 01:18:54,949
Why don't you try it?

734
01:18:55,120 --> 01:18:57,793
Carrying a big bag around all day,
and you'll see why.

735
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:00,190
Tired? Then throw the bag away!

736
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:02,316
I'll really do it!

737
01:19:28,200 --> 01:19:29,155
Asst. Commissioner.

738
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:30,716
Asst. Commissioner.

739
01:19:31,720 --> 01:19:32,550
Asst. Commissioner.

740
01:19:33,720 --> 01:19:35,676
Wong Kai Fa

741
01:21:26,120 --> 01:21:26,870
What are these?

742
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:28,793
The 3 art objects he stole.

743
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,518
He's got the money!

744
01:21:30,840 --> 01:21:32,717
Call the coast guards!

745
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:33,437
Yes, Sir!

746
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:35,278
And call the dive team!

747
01:21:36,880 --> 01:21:38,438
The money is fake.

748
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:40,949
Hold off your calls.

749
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:42,958
What a relief!

750
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:46,076
You made counterfeits again?

751
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:24,390
I will meet you on the rooftop.

752
01:22:25,160 --> 01:22:26,878
Be there before dawn.

753
01:22:27,880 --> 01:22:30,872
If you don't come,
Teresa will complete the merger.

754
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:32,718
And you'll end up with nothing.

755
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:34,718
You think he can hear you?

756
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,592
We're ready, Asst. Commissioner!

757
01:23:38,840 --> 01:23:40,831
I'm not scared of your smoke this time!

758
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:43,113
Give me a mask later.

759
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:44,795
Yes Sir!

760
01:23:55,800 --> 01:23:56,789
We're ready.

761
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,513
There's no way he'll get away!

762
01:24:02,240 --> 01:24:03,798
Tell your men to leave.

763
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:07,557
It's a private date tonight.

764
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:08,996
sure.

765
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:11,074
You guys can leave now.

766
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:11,956
Yes, Sir!

767
01:24:14,680 --> 01:24:17,114
Hurry! Get moving!

768
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:28,835
And you?

769
01:24:30,680 --> 01:24:31,795
Me too?

770
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:33,439
Thought this is a private date!

771
01:24:36,160 --> 01:24:37,434
Go now.

772
01:24:40,520 --> 01:24:44,035
You just have to be like this.

773
01:24:49,280 --> 01:24:50,508
Inspector Ho.

774
01:24:55,840 --> 01:24:57,034
Be careful.

775
01:25:11,320 --> 01:25:13,197
Asst. Commissioner, all the lifts are going up!

776
01:25:13,400 --> 01:25:16,676
Who can it be? I already locked the lifts!

777
01:25:16,840 --> 01:25:18,193
Who's inside them?

778
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:21,558
The security cameras are down.

779
01:25:21,720 --> 01:25:22,709
We have no visuals.

780
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:25,600
Listen up everyone. The suspect is in the lifts.

781
01:25:25,760 --> 01:25:27,352
Make sure he doesn't escape!

782
01:25:30,600 --> 01:25:31,715
Lift A stopped on the 12th floor.

783
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:33,871
Watch closely, I'm coming down!

784
01:26:07,080 --> 01:26:08,399
There's no one inside!

785
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:10,318
Get out of my way!

786
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:11,999
Lift B stopped on the 25th floor.

787
01:26:12,240 --> 01:26:13,832
I'm coming up!

788
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:19,798
The lift is empty!

789
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:21,793
Lift C stopped on the 1 8th floor!

790
01:26:22,400 --> 01:26:24,675
I'm coming down!

791
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:30,233
Lift C is empty!

792
01:26:30,640 --> 01:26:32,596
Lift D stopped on the 30th floor.

793
01:26:32,920 --> 01:26:34,831
I'm coming up!

794
01:26:39,400 --> 01:26:40,958
Lift D is also empty!

795
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:44,318
Understood! I'm coming down!

796
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:45,795
What floor is this?

797
01:26:45,960 --> 01:26:46,358
25th floor.

798
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,551
This is too weird!

799
01:27:17,040 --> 01:27:18,792
You're amazing.

800
01:27:19,280 --> 01:27:21,396
Kids would love to see you.

801
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:23,511
So are you happy to see me, Inspector?

802
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,353
Yes!

803
01:27:26,160 --> 01:27:27,912
But catching you will make me happier.

804
01:27:28,600 --> 01:27:29,669
I'm almost there.

805
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:33,434
Be careful, don't fall over.

806
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:39,154
If I pick up the ransom, I win.

807
01:27:39,680 --> 01:27:42,717
Of course. A promise is a promise.

808
01:28:07,520 --> 01:28:08,236
Thanks.

809
01:28:31,880 --> 01:28:34,189
I got the ransom, I win.

810
01:28:35,240 --> 01:28:37,231
But I'm happy because I've caught you.

811
01:28:38,240 --> 01:28:40,913
If I fall, you'll come with me.

812
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,556
I won't let you go!

813
01:28:59,600 --> 01:29:00,635
Where's Wong Kai Fa?

814
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:03,749
28th floor, almost there!

815
01:29:04,120 --> 01:29:05,075
I arrested the guy. Hurry!

816
01:29:05,240 --> 01:29:06,912
I'm on my way!

817
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:47,949
Inspector!

818
01:29:48,880 --> 01:29:50,677
Why call me to the rooftop
if you ended up down here?

819
01:29:50,840 --> 01:29:51,511
Where is he?

820
01:29:51,800 --> 01:29:52,437
He fell.

821
01:29:52,640 --> 01:29:53,629
He fell? Then?

822
01:29:53,800 --> 01:29:54,630
Maybe broke into pieces?

823
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:55,676
Broke into pieces?

824
01:29:56,360 --> 01:29:58,271
You've been fooled again!

825
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:00,429
Where to now?

826
01:30:02,600 --> 01:30:03,953
I'm hungry.

827
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:09,952
You've always like this.
Always say you're hungry at the end.

828
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:12,993
Asst. Commissioner, what do we do now?

829
01:30:13,520 --> 01:30:14,999
Have the men standing by.

830
01:30:32,160 --> 01:30:35,709
Merry Christmas! Gifts for everyone!

831
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,037
You'll get one! Naughty!

832
01:30:41,680 --> 01:30:42,669
You'll get yours!

833
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:49,917
"Local citizen Ho Shong Sang donates 1 00 million"

834
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:53,868
"dollars worth of sweets to children in need"

835
01:30:57,440 --> 01:30:59,556
Give them candies instead of food?

836
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:02,437
They'll need dentists!

837
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:14,549
Hi!

838
01:31:14,720 --> 01:31:16,119
Congratulations on the merger.

839
01:31:16,280 --> 01:31:17,349
Thank you for your help.

840
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:19,676
Don't mention it, It's part of the job!

841
01:31:22,880 --> 01:31:24,029
Inspector Ho!

842
01:31:28,200 --> 01:31:29,872
Merry Christmas!

843
01:31:32,720 --> 01:31:35,234
Happy New Year! Teresa!
