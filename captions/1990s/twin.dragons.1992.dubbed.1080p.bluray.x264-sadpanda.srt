You'll have to keep these boys separate.
I can't tell which is which.

8
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:15,073
You shouldn't say that, honey. Besides, we
never want them to be apart, now, do we?

Look, we've been to hell and back together,

<i>I didn't like that job anyway.</i>

173
00:15:51,801 --> 00:15:55,368
- Uh, what's your name again?
- Barbara.

174
00:15:55,437 --> 00:15:59,573
Uh, Barbara, that's right. Do you think
you can tell the big hero over there...

175
00:15:59,642 --> 00:16:01,962
if you might be interested in him?

176
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,723
Just between us, you see,

177
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,360
he's never had a girlfriend.

178
00:16:20,429 --> 00:16:23,030
It was nice meeting you.

179
00:16:25,534 --> 00:16:27,801
You have a good time. I'm going home now.

180
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:29,870
I'm sorry, Boomer.

181
00:16:54,746 --> 00:16:58,566
<i>Excuse me, Mr. Ma, is this your
first visit to Hong Kong?</i> Yes.

182
00:16:58,634 --> 00:17:02,536
<i>Well, we certainly look forward
to your concert, sir.</i>

183
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:09,443
Three hundred thousand.

184
00:17:09,511 --> 00:17:12,446
<i>That's the last time. Come on, I need a car.</i>

185
00:17:12,514 --> 00:17:15,049
Look, last time you were three hours late.

186
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:19,319
You sure didn't complain when I gave you $400.
Are you backing down on our deal?

187
00:17:19,388 --> 00:17:22,155
You scratched the last one up.
They almost found me out.

188
00:17:22,224 --> 00:17:25,192
That's $600 you owe me, hmm. Hey!

189
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:28,128
Careful. They might be watching us now.

190
00:17:28,197 --> 00:17:31,732
This is the last time.
I never wanna see you again.

191
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:34,267
Step on it! Yeah!

192
00:17:36,706 --> 00:17:39,139
I'll be back in a second. Wait. Where
the hell you think you're going?

193
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,709
I gotta take a leak. Hurry back.

194
00:17:44,046 --> 00:17:47,848
Whoa, whoa! Hey, you think you own the damn road?

195
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:50,183
Pardon me.

196
00:17:51,353 --> 00:17:53,721
<i>Here we are, Maestro.</i> Uh-huh.

197
00:17:53,789 --> 00:17:55,789
<i>Oh, bellman!</i> Hmm?

198
00:17:57,126 --> 00:18:00,961
You outdid yourself. Nice choice too.

199
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:03,296
My favorite color.

200
00:18:03,365 --> 00:18:05,565
You are<i> the</i> man.

201
00:18:05,635 --> 00:18:09,803
Let's take a ride. Get in! Huh? Hey!

202
00:18:12,141 --> 00:18:14,908
Sorry, kid, I really don't know
what you're talking about.

203
00:18:14,977 --> 00:18:17,845
Quit fooling around, huh?

204
00:18:17,913 --> 00:18:20,380
Hey, Tyson. What are you doing down there?

205
00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:23,083
Huh? You and your stupid jokes. Take that!

206
00:18:23,152 --> 00:18:25,585
It's not funny!

207
00:18:26,656 --> 00:18:29,056
Hey! Damn you!

208
00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:31,091
I'm so sorry.

209
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,660
<i>What the hell?</i>

210
00:18:36,398 --> 00:18:39,232
<i>Good morning, sir. Welcome.</i>

211
00:18:39,301 --> 00:18:41,301
Yes.

212
00:18:46,676 --> 00:18:48,625
Not 100... 400,000 shares.

213
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:51,695
Ah, there you are, John! I remember you!

214
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:55,399
Still well? I'm good. We haven't
seen each other in a long time.

215
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:58,535
Oh, come on over here. Look.
Do you recognize her?

216
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:02,306
<i>She's the same girl you used to
play with when you were a kid.</i>

217
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:06,310
Tammy, go on and say "hello" to John. Go on!

218
00:19:06,379 --> 00:19:10,580
Oh, come on, a nice, big kiss. That's better.

219
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,582
She finished her training as a nurse.

220
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:15,152
When she heard you were coming, she
quit her job, just to take care of you.

221
00:19:15,221 --> 00:19:17,454
That's nice, but I feel fine.

222
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:20,657
Now, John, there are a lot of
diseases in this part of the world.

223
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:24,328
You're a world-famous conductor. You
really can't afford to catch anything.

224
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:25,829
It would be terrible.

225
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,998
Please, I would like to freshen up first.

226
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:30,934
Oh, I'm sorry, I forgot. We'll talk later, huh?

227
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:33,770
Oh, Tammy, will you show some interest?

228
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,006
Daddy, I already have a boyfriend.

229
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:38,842
I'm helping you get a husband, not a boyfriend.

230
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,977
What about Rocky? Who? Stallone?

231
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:44,448
Not Stallone. Frankie Lok. I call him Rocky.

232
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:48,252
Even Rocky would tell you to go for it.
Now, take this medicine bag.

233
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,621
Your daddy's very serious about this.
I want you and John to hit it off.

234
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:55,459
We'll have a merger with the Ma family,
and both our businesses will prosper.

235
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,827
We'll be one big, happy
corporation... I mean, family.

236
00:19:57,896 --> 00:20:00,830
It's a very tough business world
we live in, my dear.

237
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,967
John, are you there?
My daughter's here to see you.

238
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:06,036
Now, you remember: Be nice to him. Daddy, Daddy.

239
00:20:06,105 --> 00:20:08,505
Go on, get in there.

240
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:13,110
Oh, God, I hope it works.

241
00:20:17,550 --> 00:20:21,585
Here, let me help you with this. So many bottles.
I thought your father was kidding.

242
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:25,489
I didn't know nurses were so sexy these days.
You're showing.

243
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:28,092
No, up there. Oh!

244
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:32,229
Even when I was a child, I hardly
needed vitamins or medicine.

245
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:34,731
If I had known, I wouldn't have brought so many.

246
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,900
Come on, sit over here.

247
00:20:36,969 --> 00:20:38,969
Thank you.

248
00:20:40,939 --> 00:20:44,074
Your dress is a bit tight.
Must restrict the circulation.

249
00:20:44,143 --> 00:20:49,513
And your posture's not too good. That's probably
why you often get a sore back. Am I right?

250
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:52,349
How'd you know that? Hmm, come with me.

251
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,351
Lie down, please. So soon?

252
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,253
Ooh. Oh?

253
00:20:56,322 --> 00:21:01,258
Don't worry. No need to rush. We'll go slowly.

254
00:21:04,997 --> 00:21:07,197
Ooh!

255
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,699
Put your leg up here. Just relax.

256
00:21:11,837 --> 00:21:15,205
I'm almost done. Wouldn't it
be easier with my clothes off?

257
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,274
No need to.

258
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,548
I'm just loosening you up.

259
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:29,886
It improves the circulation.

260
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,888
Are we ready yet?

261
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,458
Feels pretty good, don't you think?

262
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:42,899
Asleep already?

263
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,469
You must be very tired.

264
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:53,326
I can't believe just because
we don't have the $300,000,

265
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,328
we have to run away to China.

266
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:58,932
That's a real joke. Hey, I didn't drive that bad.

267
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,836
So we came in second. What's so wrong with that?

268
00:22:02,905 --> 00:22:06,606
Did we win anything for it?
Not really. Hold this.

269
00:22:06,675 --> 00:22:08,708
Oh, my back.

270
00:22:08,777 --> 00:22:12,378
Hi, I slept so well after that
workout you gave me last night.

271
00:22:12,448 --> 00:22:14,414
Would you like to see a menu? Mm-hmm.

272
00:22:14,483 --> 00:22:19,018
- Let's go! I ain't got all day.
- I'm busy. Talk to him.

273
00:22:19,087 --> 00:22:21,047
What's he saying? I'm out of breath. Talk to him.

274
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,790
Where's my money? Tyson, give him the money.

275
00:22:23,859 --> 00:22:26,225
You got the money. No, you have it.

276
00:22:26,294 --> 00:22:28,862
Oh, right.

277
00:22:28,931 --> 00:22:31,531
Wait. I'll give you half
now... What are you doing?

278
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:35,201
Listen here. I know the boat's stolen.
I hope you can appreciate it.

279
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,203
Call me when you get to the mainland.

280
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:40,841
Do you remember Barbara's last name?
Barbara Whatchamacallit.

281
00:22:40,909 --> 00:22:42,843
You fueled the tank, didn't you?

282
00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:44,911
Oh, yeah!

283
00:22:50,385 --> 00:22:54,020
Tyson, I think we've been double-crossed.
<i>What, there's no boat?</i>

284
00:22:54,089 --> 00:22:56,690
A farewell party. That wasn't necessary.

285
00:22:56,758 --> 00:22:59,726
You idiot! Over there! Let's get out of here.

286
00:23:03,832 --> 00:23:07,266
I left my phone book. I have to get it.
Forget the stupid phone book.

287
00:23:07,335 --> 00:23:09,302
Untie the rope!

288
00:23:09,371 --> 00:23:12,672
- Stop those two idiots!
- Hurry up, will ya?

289
00:23:14,743 --> 00:23:17,777
Come on, come on. Go!

290
00:23:19,715 --> 00:23:24,784
- Stop right there!
- Where the hell do you think you're going?

291
00:23:24,853 --> 00:23:27,320
You're not going anywhere.
What are we gonna do now?

292
00:23:27,389 --> 00:23:29,455
There's no way out. We should just go ashore.

293
00:23:29,525 --> 00:23:31,457
Either way we're gonna die. What?

294
00:23:31,527 --> 00:23:33,894
Let's go!

295
00:23:40,235 --> 00:23:42,168
Stop that boat! Stop it!

296
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,641
You know, maybe you should let me drive. Quick!

297
00:23:47,709 --> 00:23:50,410
Put on your life jacket and shut up.

298
00:23:54,917 --> 00:23:56,850
There, that's it. That's it.

299
00:23:56,919 --> 00:24:00,086
Go! Come on!

300
00:24:04,292 --> 00:24:06,826
Yes! Let's go meet them at the docks.

301
00:24:08,129 --> 00:24:12,498
You better sit down! You're gonna fall out!

302
00:24:19,608 --> 00:24:23,443
What's the matter? Must be the chair.
I feel like I'm on a boat.

303
00:24:23,511 --> 00:24:27,213
<i>I've been feeling strange ever since I got here.</i>

304
00:24:27,282 --> 00:24:30,482
I don't know. Maybe it's jet lag.
I feel like I'm seasick.

305
00:24:32,287 --> 00:24:34,821
<i>My father said you should use his car.</i>

306
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:38,692
He said it'd be more convenient for you.
Here, take it.

307
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:41,294
Thank you. It's very kind, but
I don't even know the roads.

308
00:24:41,362 --> 00:24:43,296
If you get lost, just call me.

309
00:24:51,006 --> 00:24:54,007
These chairs are springy, aren't they?
What are you trying to do?

310
00:25:10,859 --> 00:25:13,026
I want them... now!

311
00:25:25,573 --> 00:25:28,742
Over there! Get closer!

312
00:25:28,810 --> 00:25:32,679
Take that!

313
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:37,717
Boomer, check this out. Will
you quit fooling around?

314
00:25:46,227 --> 00:25:49,829
Look out over there!

315
00:26:05,747 --> 00:26:08,281
Oh, God! Tyson!

316
00:26:08,349 --> 00:26:11,818
- Come on, he's ours.
- Stop him, now! Will!

317
00:26:11,887 --> 00:26:15,188
Let's get 'em. All right.

318
00:26:15,256 --> 00:26:18,224
Oh, hurry. I think I'm dying.

319
00:26:21,596 --> 00:26:23,730
We're almost there. Hang on!

320
00:26:26,367 --> 00:26:28,868
I'll make them pay.

321
00:26:36,244 --> 00:26:39,204
Boomer, Boomer, I'm not dead.
You can come back now.

322
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:49,005
Help me. I can't drive this. Hurry!

323
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:51,954
- Turn, turn! Look in front of you!
- Get out of the way!

324
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,754
That was close.

325
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:15,431
Tyson!

326
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:20,086
Well done. Okay.

327
00:27:20,155 --> 00:27:23,055
Hey! Moron! Watch where you're going!

328
00:27:23,125 --> 00:27:25,291
Yeah, tell him that.

329
00:27:30,298 --> 00:27:32,599
You okay, boss?

330
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:44,410
<i>You want trays? He started throwing water.</i>

331
00:27:44,479 --> 00:27:46,479
Check, please.

332
00:27:49,184 --> 00:27:51,184
We're back on shore now. I'm sorry about that.

333
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:53,853
Come on.

334
00:27:53,921 --> 00:27:56,523
Why don't you go change
and we'll go somewhere else?

335
00:27:56,591 --> 00:28:01,194
No, thank you. I'm afraid we'll go
on another boat ride. Thank you.

336
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:03,230
It's me.

337
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:06,633
Boomer, is this the mainland?

338
00:28:06,701 --> 00:28:10,153
We made it, didn't we? We're still in Hong Kong.
You're lucky, you know.

339
00:28:10,222 --> 00:28:13,923
You got away with just a few bumps and bruises.
You should see what happened to Boss Wing.

340
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:15,592
He was totally wiped out.

341
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:23,666
Enough. Will you please keep quiet.
I can't hear anything.

342
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:32,275
Hi. Are you a doctor? What?

343
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:35,378
Are you a doctor? Are you blind?
What else would I be?

344
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,447
Eat slowly. It's very hot.

345
00:28:42,153 --> 00:28:46,022
You know, you guys piss me off.

346
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:49,358
For your information, this
hospital pays us protection money.

347
00:28:49,428 --> 00:28:52,796
That means you're in deep shit, punk.

348
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:55,331
Tyson, we're changing hospitals. - All right.

349
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:01,738
Hey!

350
00:29:01,807 --> 00:29:05,408
If I were you, I wouldn't try anything stupid,
'cause you can't get out of this one.

351
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:08,878
You see, I had a job that required
my boss' great driving skills.

352
00:29:08,947 --> 00:29:10,880
And since you put him out of commission,

353
00:29:10,949 --> 00:29:13,589
and since I know you can handle a
car, I'm offering the job to you.

354
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:15,885
What is it? You'll find out soon enough.

355
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:19,422
Keep your cellular phone on 24 hours a day.
We'll be contacting you.

356
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:24,561
And if you don't answer, you can
pick up your buddy piece by piece.

357
00:29:24,629 --> 00:29:26,629
All right, men.

358
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:31,267
I wanna hear the music and the feeling...

359
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:33,336
together as one.

360
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:44,781
Hello? Tammy, we on for tonight? Where are you?

361
00:29:44,850 --> 00:29:47,684
Rocky, I'm kind of busy right now.

362
00:29:47,752 --> 00:29:49,519
You're seeing someone else, ain't ya?

363
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:54,691
No, of course I'm not seeing anyone else.
I wouldn't lie to you.

364
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:58,761
Right. I'll call you in a few days.
I'm working on some business.

365
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:01,350
<i>Hey, Tammy. I knew it.</i>

366
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:05,635
So that's the little twerp you're
going out with instead of me.

367
00:30:05,704 --> 00:30:08,204
<i>I'll show this guy.</i> Hey!

368
00:30:16,948 --> 00:30:20,449
That's the feeling I'm talking
about, but no chairs. As one.

369
00:30:20,519 --> 00:30:23,653
- Is this the guy?
- Huh?

370
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,558
Run before he kills you. Hurry! Come on.

371
00:30:32,063 --> 00:30:35,614
Tyson was always nice to you.
Why don't you go to see him?

372
00:30:35,684 --> 00:30:38,951
He's in a lot of pain, and you can make his day.

373
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:41,620
Well, I don't want him to get the wrong idea.

374
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:44,290
You can see him as a friend
and settle the rest later.

375
00:30:44,358 --> 00:30:48,427
I don't think I can do that. Sounds very serious.

376
00:30:48,496 --> 00:30:50,563
If you need anything else...

377
00:30:50,631 --> 00:30:53,632
<i>No? ♫</i>

378
00:30:57,405 --> 00:31:00,685
Two, please. Yes, of course. Right this way.

379
00:31:06,347 --> 00:31:09,515
I don't want to go to the hospital.
Let's just have lunch, okay?

380
00:31:09,584 --> 00:31:11,517
Uh, I take care of it for you.

381
00:31:11,586 --> 00:31:14,453
Excuse me. Sir, sir?

382
00:31:14,522 --> 00:31:19,491
Would you mind not leaning on the glass? You
might disturb the gentleman on the other side.

383
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:24,563
Excuse me, sir, I've instructed the gentleman
on the other side not to disturb you.

384
00:31:27,202 --> 00:31:28,801
<i>Hmm?</i>

385
00:31:28,870 --> 00:31:32,538
It's very sweet, you know,
Tyson having a crush on me.

386
00:31:32,607 --> 00:31:36,209
But I'm not gonna be his girlfriend.
People change. Come on.

387
00:31:36,277 --> 00:31:40,312
Who was that huge guy back there? M-My boyfriend.

388
00:31:40,381 --> 00:31:44,483
Looks more like a gorilla. I work
with him at the health club.

389
00:31:44,552 --> 00:31:46,485
Wait a minute. I thought you were a nurse.

390
00:31:46,554 --> 00:31:49,822
Look, if you promise to tell
him, then we can stop by.

391
00:31:49,891 --> 00:31:54,677
- Sounds fair enough. Waiter. Check, please.
- Okay. Coming.

392
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,213
<i>So that's it. Let's get out of here.</i>

393
00:31:57,282 --> 00:32:00,283
I'd like to go back soon. I have a rehearsal.

394
00:32:00,352 --> 00:32:03,552
I hope it's all right. Your check, sir.

395
00:32:03,621 --> 00:32:06,455
Is it a policy? We haven't ordered yet.

396
00:32:06,524 --> 00:32:09,859
Oh, sorry. So...

397
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:14,230
- <i> Get out of my way!</i>
- He's not a bad guy. - Here he comes now.

398
00:32:15,901 --> 00:32:18,167
You better hide.

399
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:20,270
♫ Tammy!

400
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,576
Move! Hey!

401
00:32:27,645 --> 00:32:32,481
- What are you doing?
- Just get out. Run! - You scum!

402
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:38,421
Hey, hey! Hold it right there. You hear me?

403
00:32:38,489 --> 00:32:41,257
Nobody messes around with my girl.
Get back here, you son of a bitch!

404
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:43,259
Rocky, wait! Come back.

405
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:47,379
Hey! Stop it! Stand back.

406
00:32:47,448 --> 00:32:50,216
Tammy, I'm gonna show you what a real man is.

407
00:32:50,285 --> 00:32:53,119
You better run, or he's gonna kill you.

408
00:32:53,188 --> 00:32:57,323
Ow, Tammy. You look great.

409
00:32:57,391 --> 00:33:01,560
Be right back. Wait!

410
00:33:01,629 --> 00:33:05,898
I'm gonna get you, you sucker. What's going on?

411
00:33:05,967 --> 00:33:07,533
<i>Don't hit him!</i>

412
00:33:07,601 --> 00:33:11,470
Why are you defending me? I
don't even know you. Tammy!

413
00:33:14,042 --> 00:33:16,722
You better run. I'll hold him for you. What?

414
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:20,847
Go on! Run! What? You are really
hurting my pride now, miss.

415
00:33:36,064 --> 00:33:37,997
You forgot your change, mister.

416
00:33:38,066 --> 00:33:39,999
I don't want it. Thank you, sir.

417
00:33:40,068 --> 00:33:42,801
Here, you hold her. I got her.

418
00:33:42,871 --> 00:33:44,871
Haven't you had enough yet?

419
00:33:48,376 --> 00:33:50,496
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

420
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:55,848
Wait. I don't even know you.
So what? I don't care.

421
00:33:56,851 --> 00:33:58,851
Excuse me.

422
00:34:01,356 --> 00:34:03,356
<i>Hey.</i>

423
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:09,428
Why are you in such a hurry? You
didn't pay the bill? No, I did not.

424
00:34:09,497 --> 00:34:13,065
Hey, where'd you get that jacket?
Did you steal it?

425
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:15,801
What are you talking about? Cut it out.

426
00:34:15,870 --> 00:34:18,804
Wow! That's a great car.

427
00:34:18,873 --> 00:34:20,913
Cool! Whose is it?

428
00:34:22,877 --> 00:34:26,312
I can't believe it. Does it belong to a lawyer?
Can I drop you somewhere?

429
00:34:26,381 --> 00:34:30,616
What a car! Real leather.

430
00:34:35,256 --> 00:34:37,089
Excuse me.

431
00:34:42,196 --> 00:34:45,932
Come on now. You shouldn't do this.
Why don't you tell him that?

432
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:52,354
Wait. I really have no idea who you are.

433
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:02,364
Now you're gonna get it.

434
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:11,207
Please, don't do this.
You're as good as dead. Huh?

435
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:16,145
These cost money.

436
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:25,321
Don't you ever try to cross Rocky again!
Who'd want this now?

437
00:35:27,225 --> 00:35:29,558
My balls are everywhere!

438
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:38,667
Hey, I'm warning you. You gotta stop! Come on!

439
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,505
I'm gonna...

440
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:47,543
I don't want to hurt you anymore.

441
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:50,346
Don't you stop? We have to settle this bill.

442
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:55,084
Hey, someone's got to pay.
Come on. Pick all this up.

443
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,023
There's the manager. No, you take care of him.

444
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:03,459
Look, you've got to pay this! Like hell I will.

445
00:36:10,135 --> 00:36:12,135
That guy's crazy.

446
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:17,073
I never knew you were so strong.
What are you doing?

447
00:36:17,142 --> 00:36:20,709
I really like what I just found out about you.

448
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:23,880
Well, I'm glad. What do you want from me?

449
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:27,950
Don't tease me like that. "Teasing"?

450
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:31,220
Well, whatever you say. Hmm!

451
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:36,292
Please, tell me your name. Boomer,
would you stop kidding around... punk.

452
00:36:38,129 --> 00:36:40,462
My name's John Ma, not Boomer.

453
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:43,833
So where should I drop you off? At the hospital.

454
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:47,569
Why? Are you sick? You asked me to go see Tyson.

455
00:36:47,638 --> 00:36:49,672
Oh, really?

456
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,008
Stop acting. Always on stage. I know.

457
00:36:52,076 --> 00:36:55,278
I played the piano when I was eight.

458
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:58,181
The Royal Music Conservatory at 12.

459
00:36:58,249 --> 00:37:00,683
At 20, I won the Beethoven Conducting Award.

460
00:37:00,751 --> 00:37:04,687
Like you have a lot of money. Well...

461
00:37:04,755 --> 00:37:08,557
Of course, you went to the
finest schools overseas, huh?

462
00:37:08,626 --> 00:37:11,360
How do you know? Oh, of course.

463
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:19,969
Wow! Huge place. You know, you made
me feel so good the other day.

464
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:22,138
Would you mind doing it again?

465
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:24,807
I don't know what you're talking about, lady.
I'm just a mechanic.

466
00:37:24,809 --> 00:37:27,710
I'll go lie down. Hurry.

467
00:37:31,716 --> 00:37:35,818
Hmm? Oh. This joke's going
further than I thought.

468
00:37:35,887 --> 00:37:39,088
I might as well go for it.

469
00:37:39,157 --> 00:37:41,390
I'll fix her motor.

470
00:37:41,459 --> 00:37:46,996
<i>♫</i> Wow, look at this. This is great.

471
00:37:49,901 --> 00:37:53,102
Hey, you know, that's very good, Beethoven.

472
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:55,171
Beethoven?

473
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,650
Stop! What is it?

474
00:38:08,719 --> 00:38:10,719
Oh, continue.

475
00:38:18,529 --> 00:38:21,290
I'm sorry. Go on. Okay.

476
00:38:57,501 --> 00:39:00,769
Your turn. Try it. Me?

477
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,838
You think so?

478
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,175
No, I can't. Sit down.

479
00:39:24,728 --> 00:39:29,798
I can't wait any longer. Hurry up. Hmm?

480
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,734
All right!

481
00:39:38,009 --> 00:39:42,011
Yah-ha!

482
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:15,744
I didn't know you drank and smoked.
Always after a workout.

483
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:20,049
A workout? That's all it was?

484
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:22,551
Hey, you're the one who took me up here.

485
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,121
That was very different from the last time.

486
00:40:25,189 --> 00:40:27,123
You mean we've done this before?

487
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:29,125
Stop it. What do you think I am?

488
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:32,694
I don't think anything. So what's the matter?

489
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:37,033
Aren't you gonna get that?

490
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:39,235
I gotta go.

491
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:42,388
What concert are you talking about?
The one I'll be conducting.

492
00:40:42,456 --> 00:40:44,890
All right! No more jokes, okay?

493
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:48,761
Boomer, I thought I told you I never
wanted to see you in here again.

494
00:40:48,829 --> 00:40:51,730
Mister, you are really impolite. You are Mr...

495
00:40:51,799 --> 00:40:53,899
Security! <i>Come on, let's get out of here.</i>

496
00:40:53,967 --> 00:40:56,335
We have a problem. Excuse me, sir?

497
00:40:56,404 --> 00:40:59,538
What seems to be the problem? I know this man.
He's always trouble around here.

498
00:40:59,607 --> 00:41:02,274
Mr. Ma! There must be some kind of mistake.

499
00:41:02,343 --> 00:41:07,012
Mr. Ma is a world-famous conductor.
You should apologize.

500
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:11,517
S-Sorry. Let's get back to work.

501
00:41:11,585 --> 00:41:13,552
Mr. Ma, it's an honor.

502
00:41:13,621 --> 00:41:17,889
Thank you for your help. Don't bother our guests.
I'm sorry. I should get back to my room.

503
00:41:17,958 --> 00:41:20,526
By the way, the concert hall
is filled to capacity.

504
00:41:20,594 --> 00:41:23,595
Ah, that's right. I almost forgot. Thank you.

505
00:41:23,664 --> 00:41:27,999
If the lady needs anything special,
please don't hesitate to ask.

506
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:30,302
Welcome, welcome. Mm-hmm.

507
00:41:30,371 --> 00:41:34,239
Why do they all know you?
I really need some good help.

508
00:41:34,308 --> 00:41:37,008
Hey, these clothes are ridiculous.
Let's get one thing straight.

509
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,645
I don't have to be your slave
because I slept with you.

510
00:41:39,714 --> 00:41:41,647
What are you talking about? Give me a kiss.

511
00:41:41,716 --> 00:41:44,182
Stay still, will you? Thousands of
people are waiting to see you perform.

512
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:48,754
Perform? Now we gotta do it in public?
Hey, be careful.

513
00:41:48,823 --> 00:41:51,289
Let's go. Come on, hurry, hurry.
Where are we going?

514
00:41:53,461 --> 00:41:56,061
So, how much you pay them to put on that show?

515
00:41:56,129 --> 00:41:58,897
A room here costs $400 a day. Four hundred!

516
00:41:58,966 --> 00:42:00,926
Yes. U.S. dollars.

517
00:42:03,003 --> 00:42:05,270
You look like a conductor.
What do you mean, "look like"?

518
00:42:05,339 --> 00:42:07,639
I really am a conductor.
I wasn't kidding, you know.

519
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:11,243
I know you're teasing me, but I love that.

520
00:42:13,647 --> 00:42:16,181
I don't know why I let her push me around.

521
00:42:16,250 --> 00:42:19,485
How do I get myself into this mess?
Hmm, anyway, she is pretty.

522
00:42:23,056 --> 00:42:25,056
Not again.

523
00:42:37,938 --> 00:42:39,938
♫

524
00:42:43,444 --> 00:42:45,844
Ghost! You look just like me.

525
00:42:45,913 --> 00:42:48,914
We're even dressed the same.

526
00:42:53,287 --> 00:42:56,054
Weird. I don't know about you,
but I think I am going crazy.

527
00:42:56,123 --> 00:42:58,657
Wow! It's strange, isn't it?

528
00:42:58,726 --> 00:43:01,760
Hey, imagine, I could be taken for you.

529
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:06,532
Ah! No wonder the girl out
there thinks I'm a musician.

530
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:08,534
She certainly thinks I'm you.

531
00:43:08,602 --> 00:43:13,371
That's why the girl doesn't
believe I'm giving a concert.

532
00:43:13,441 --> 00:43:16,174
Ah! You play in a band. A band?

533
00:43:16,243 --> 00:43:19,344
Never mind. Well, what are you gonna do?
What do you mean?

534
00:43:19,413 --> 00:43:23,348
You're wearing my clothes. You have to
give them back to me and fix things up.

535
00:43:23,417 --> 00:43:26,518
Okay, but don't tell the
girl I'm with, all right?

536
00:43:26,587 --> 00:43:28,654
Wait. Do you know a Barbara?

537
00:43:28,722 --> 00:43:32,023
What? You mean you know her? I'm
pretty sure that's her name.

538
00:43:32,092 --> 00:43:35,026
She got into my car and asked me
to take her to the hospital...

539
00:43:35,095 --> 00:43:37,529
to see this guy, Tyson.

540
00:43:37,598 --> 00:43:40,599
It's getting awfully confusing.

541
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:50,375
How come when I sneeze, you sneeze? Right.

542
00:43:50,444 --> 00:43:52,811
Were you on a boat lately? You're right.

543
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:56,381
Oh, my God. No wonder I was seasick.

544
00:43:56,450 --> 00:43:58,484
What do you do when I get laid?

545
00:43:58,552 --> 00:44:01,920
You mean, with a girl? Of course.
What else would it be?

546
00:44:03,991 --> 00:44:06,024
I hope he's not too kinky. Oh, wait.

547
00:44:06,093 --> 00:44:09,260
Wait! Hey, you better take your hand off me.

548
00:44:09,329 --> 00:44:11,830
You're forgetting your phone.

549
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,000
Thanks a lot.

550
00:44:19,039 --> 00:44:22,891
Ah, maestro, right on schedule.

551
00:44:23,878 --> 00:44:28,381
<i>Hey! Finally ready?</i> Barbara,
what are you doing here?

552
00:44:28,449 --> 00:44:30,983
Always kidding. Is there
something wrong with you?

553
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:35,821
What's going on here? Why do I have
to remind you of every little detail?

554
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,890
Please, not now.

555
00:44:37,958 --> 00:44:40,359
Hello?

556
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:42,361
Hi, Boomer. Who's this?

557
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:45,130
Better get your ass out here.
We've been lookin' for you.

558
00:44:45,199 --> 00:44:47,966
Oh, no, I'm not Boomer.
You've got the wrong number.

559
00:44:48,035 --> 00:44:52,838
Huh? This phone isn't mine.
They got switched around.

560
00:44:54,742 --> 00:44:57,610
You just wait right here. Wait.

561
00:44:57,678 --> 00:45:00,579
Yes. Boomer!

562
00:45:00,648 --> 00:45:03,115
Where are you? I'm in the lobby with Barbara.
Just tell me where you are.

563
00:45:03,183 --> 00:45:07,486
- I'm in my car with Tammy.
- Get in here. I got to protect her. Make it fast.

564
00:45:07,555 --> 00:45:10,723
You can't take her with you.
It's getting too dangerous.

565
00:45:10,792 --> 00:45:13,626
But I can't go inside. I need your
help to explain something to her.

566
00:45:13,694 --> 00:45:16,214
You don't understand. I've got
more than I can handle right now.

567
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:18,964
What? What?

568
00:45:19,033 --> 00:45:22,701
John, John? Hello? Damn it. The battery.

569
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:25,037
Please wait a second. I need to change phones.

570
00:45:25,105 --> 00:45:27,306
Wait, please! We're gonna be late.

571
00:45:27,374 --> 00:45:29,442
I'll be right back.

572
00:45:29,510 --> 00:45:31,827
Stay here. Don't go away.
I'll be right back, okay?

573
00:45:31,896 --> 00:45:33,896
Where you going?

574
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:45,741
Ah, Maestro! This way.

575
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:48,077
That was quick. Please, get in.

576
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:50,545
Get in! Please. Thank you.

577
00:45:52,049 --> 00:45:55,684
I was really getting worried.
We're gonna be late.

578
00:45:55,753 --> 00:45:57,820
- Driver, let's go.
- All right.

579
00:45:57,888 --> 00:45:59,822
Where we going?

580
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:02,924
To your concert.

581
00:46:04,411 --> 00:46:08,481
Is that Boomer I saw leaving right now in
that big car? Yeah, that was him all right.

582
00:46:11,586 --> 00:46:14,019
Then who the heck's that?

583
00:46:14,088 --> 00:46:16,188
Oh, hi.

584
00:46:16,256 --> 00:46:20,759
I thought I just saw you leave.

585
00:46:20,828 --> 00:46:23,395
Barbara, I'm glad you're here.

586
00:46:23,464 --> 00:46:25,464
I have to talk to you. Stay away. Don't touch me.

587
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:28,100
Pretending you don't know us? Have we met before?

588
00:46:28,168 --> 00:46:30,288
We're holding your little
friend, so don't mess around.

589
00:46:30,304 --> 00:46:33,572
I'm not sure I understand.
I'm talking about Tyson.

590
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:42,347
Don't you think you can tell me where I'm going?

591
00:46:42,416 --> 00:46:45,850
You're gonna save someone for us.
Sounds interesting. Who?

592
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:48,686
The cops got our boss. He's
in that truck right there.

593
00:46:48,755 --> 00:46:52,024
No way. Chase the police?
I'm not a race car driver.

594
00:46:52,092 --> 00:46:54,793
I heard you were the best.
Now is the time to prove it.

595
00:46:54,861 --> 00:46:57,941
If you fail, Barbara and Tyson are history.

596
00:46:57,998 --> 00:47:02,000
Don't be uptight. I'm not scared.
You're the one who needs to relax.

597
00:47:04,838 --> 00:47:08,373
Oh, no, you must be kidding.
I'm getting out of here. Go!

598
00:47:08,442 --> 00:47:13,245
Stop fooling around. Show me
you're the famous John Ma.

599
00:47:13,314 --> 00:47:16,281
I'm not Maestro Ma. I'm Boomer.

600
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:19,251
Don't jeopardize your future. Now get out there.

601
00:47:19,320 --> 00:47:23,989
Stop it! I'm not jeopardizing my future.

602
00:47:24,058 --> 00:47:26,791
You've worked so hard
all your life for this night.

603
00:47:26,860 --> 00:47:31,063
Now you get out there. Show some guts.

604
00:47:31,131 --> 00:47:33,065
Fine. I'll go out there.

605
00:47:33,133 --> 00:47:35,133
But you'll be sorry.

606
00:47:42,009 --> 00:47:46,278
What are you doing? Wait. There's
so many people out there.

607
00:47:46,347 --> 00:47:48,013
Your baton. What's that?

608
00:47:48,082 --> 00:47:50,849
Just wave it around. You'll be all right.

609
00:47:50,917 --> 00:47:53,385
Here goes nothing.

610
00:48:02,363 --> 00:48:05,998
All right, let's move it!

611
00:48:25,585 --> 00:48:27,619
We'll get you out of here, boss!

612
00:48:56,316 --> 00:48:58,316
This is fun.

613
00:49:05,392 --> 00:49:08,393
Get out! Get out!

614
00:49:13,150 --> 00:49:15,918
Wait for me here and stay cool. Move it!

615
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:18,426
What's wrong with this door, damn it?

616
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:21,790
Unlock the door. Take it easy. Thanks a lot.

617
00:49:42,762 --> 00:49:46,164
<i>What? Are you sure you don't have any
reservations tonight after 9:00?</i>

618
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:50,368

calling last Tuesday and... Hey.

Ah! Oh. Ah! Hurry up, will ya?

620
00:49:58,145 --> 00:50:00,579
It's Tues... No, you don't understand.

621
00:50:00,647 --> 00:50:03,315
Hey. Sorry. It's my turn. Go away.

622
00:50:07,988 --> 00:50:11,323
Hello?

623
00:50:11,391 --> 00:50:14,993
- Is that you, John?
- Boomer, I need your help to get me out of here.

624
00:50:15,061 --> 00:50:17,462
I need you here. You don't understand.

625
00:50:17,531 --> 00:50:21,500
They put me on stage. I'm conducting your concert.
It's turning into a disaster.

626
00:50:21,568 --> 00:50:24,136
Just wave your hands around, all right?

627
00:50:24,204 --> 00:50:27,405
- What's happening to you?
- Get out of the car now!

628
00:50:27,474 --> 00:50:30,175
We're sorry...

629
00:50:30,244 --> 00:50:32,644

00:54:57,127 --> 00:55:01,396
Did you see me come back? I really think we
should hurry up for the press conference.

670
00:55:01,465 --> 00:55:03,825
I have to take a shower. I'll be right back.

671
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:05,967
John?

672
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:08,036
Uh, thank you.

673
00:55:09,373 --> 00:55:11,373
Get in. Hurry.

674
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:15,877
<i>You can't believe what just happened!</i>

675
00:55:15,946 --> 00:55:19,397
And what about me? I was almost killed.

676
00:55:19,466 --> 00:55:21,900
Let's forget about it and be ourselves.

677
00:55:21,969 --> 00:55:25,236
You're Boomer, and I'm John Ma, okay?

678
00:55:25,305 --> 00:55:29,107
Tell me: Did you sleep with Barbara?

679
00:55:29,175 --> 00:55:31,409
No. We didn't do anything. Good.

680
00:55:31,478 --> 00:55:33,645
She's Tyson's girl.

681
00:55:40,887 --> 00:55:44,055
It's Tammy. Don't you think
you should go hide upstairs?

682
00:55:45,558 --> 00:55:47,558
Okay.

683
00:55:53,533 --> 00:55:55,467
Hello, Tammy. It's me.

684
00:55:55,535 --> 00:55:59,003
Haven't you showered yet?
There's lots of people waiting.

685
00:55:59,072 --> 00:56:01,639
I know. But you go down first,
and I will join you soon.

686
00:56:01,708 --> 00:56:04,442
Hold it. Hmm.

687
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,814
Give me a kiss. You scum.

688
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:13,250
I'll wait downstairs.

689
00:56:16,756 --> 00:56:18,756
My purse.

690
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:24,095
Oh, you're here. Boomer, what are you doing?

691
00:56:24,163 --> 00:56:26,631
I'm filling the bathtub. What's it look like?

692
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:28,766
This whole situation's getting out of hand.

693
00:56:28,835 --> 00:56:30,869
Oh, Boomer. What should we do?

694
00:56:30,937 --> 00:56:33,872
It's ridiculous.

695
00:56:33,940 --> 00:56:36,474
I think I like Barbara a little.
<i>Don't even think about it.</i>

696
00:56:36,543 --> 00:56:38,810
Barbara is Tyson's girl, you hear?

697
00:56:41,014 --> 00:56:43,848
<i>What's the big deal? I don't even know Tyson.</i>

698
00:56:45,451 --> 00:56:48,586
Wait a minute. When you touch Tyson's
girl, it's like touching my girl.

699
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:51,288
<i>So stay away from her, you hear?</i>

700
00:56:51,357 --> 00:56:55,827
- But you touched my girl.
- How could I know she's your girl?

701
00:56:55,896 --> 00:57:00,532
It doesn't matter whether she is or not.
Don't mess around with her.

702
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,534
Wait! Come back.

703
00:57:02,602 --> 00:57:05,236
<i>Are you telling me what to do?</i>

704
00:57:05,304 --> 00:57:08,506
Just a minute!

705
00:57:08,575 --> 00:57:11,242
<i>John Ma.</i>

706
00:57:11,310 --> 00:57:15,680
Are you all right?

707
00:57:15,749 --> 00:57:18,516
I'm fine! Huh?

708
00:57:18,585 --> 00:57:21,285
Why did you answer? <i>I'm</i> John Ma.

709
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:23,955
She really thinks I'm you. I answered.

710
00:57:24,024 --> 00:57:27,559
- Hey. Is there somebody in there with you?
- Wait!

711
00:57:27,627 --> 00:57:31,062
Tammy is my girl. I'm the one she likes.
Not you, but John Ma.

712
00:57:31,130 --> 00:57:34,032
Not Boomer, you hear? I'm not so sure.

713
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:36,901
Besides, we already...

714
00:57:38,471 --> 00:57:42,674
You know. Do you want her to know
she's been tricked, you impostor?

715
00:57:42,742 --> 00:57:46,310
<i>John Ma, if you don't open the
door, I'll break it down.</i>

716
00:57:46,379 --> 00:57:48,379
Uh, wait!

717
00:57:48,448 --> 00:57:51,049
You better find a place to hide.

718
00:57:53,486 --> 00:57:57,822
<i>Hey! You better not touch her.</i>

719
00:57:58,992 --> 00:58:01,158
Why did you do that?

720
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:03,995
I'm sorry! Are you all right? I'm fine.

721
00:58:04,064 --> 00:58:06,163
Who were you talking to?

722
00:58:07,166 --> 00:58:09,100
I fooled you, didn't I?

723
00:58:09,168 --> 00:58:11,268
I was pretending to be two different people.

724
00:58:11,337 --> 00:58:14,338
Not bad, huh? I've showered. Let's go downstairs.

725
00:58:18,244 --> 00:58:21,495
Uh-oh. Tammy, what are you doing?

726
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:24,665
Now that<i> I'm</i> all wet, I need to
take a bath and change my clothes.

727
00:58:24,735 --> 00:58:26,735
A bath?

728
00:58:29,940 --> 00:58:33,474
Would you excuse me? I also need to take one.

729
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:36,644
All right. Let's take one together.

730
00:58:36,713 --> 00:58:40,615
I've changed my mind. We took a
bath together the other day.

731
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:43,451
We did? Are you sure about that?

732
00:58:43,519 --> 00:58:45,553
Mmm. Yes, I am sure.

733
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:48,689
And you even put your hands all over me.
You were so naughty.

734
00:58:48,759 --> 00:58:52,560
You dirty rat! You took a bath with my girl!

735
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:56,330
Huh? Why are you undressed
if you're not taking a bath?

736
00:58:56,399 --> 00:58:58,532
I guess I changed my mind again.

737
00:58:58,601 --> 00:59:01,202
I really can't figure you out.

738
00:59:04,340 --> 00:59:08,542
Hey. Why have you put your clothes back on?

739
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,914
Oh. I never took them off, Tammy.

740
00:59:12,983 --> 00:59:15,917
Huh?

741
00:59:15,986 --> 00:59:17,986
I must be seeing things.

742
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,691
Wh-What are you doing?

743
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,828
Draining it. No need. The water's clean.

744
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:29,730
Didn't you just take a bath?

745
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:32,066
I have to fill it up after I'm done.

746
00:59:32,135 --> 00:59:34,836
It's just another habit of mine.

747
00:59:34,905 --> 00:59:38,006
There is still so much I have to learn about you.

748
00:59:39,776 --> 00:59:41,776
<i>So cute.</i>

749
00:59:42,979 --> 00:59:46,848
Then I better start now, since I'm already yours.

750
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:56,223
Maybe it's better we<i> don't</i> take a bath together.
It could take us hours.

751
00:59:56,292 --> 00:59:58,726
John, what's the matter?

752
00:59:58,795 --> 01:00:01,629
Surprise!

753
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:03,765
<i>Let's take a bath together.</i>

754
01:00:04,768 --> 01:00:08,102
You're so horrible!

755
01:00:08,171 --> 01:00:11,405
You're such a naughty boy. They're all waiting.

756
01:00:11,475 --> 01:00:15,710
We don't have enough time. Forget about that.
Let's enjoy ourselves.

757
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:23,250
It's just a reflection. Take it easy. John...

758
01:00:23,319 --> 01:00:25,252
It's a mirror.

759
01:00:25,321 --> 01:00:27,722
It's a mirror.

760
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:31,960
- Don't scare me like that.
- I'm awfully sorry.

761
01:00:32,028 --> 01:00:34,161
Who's that?

762
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:39,167
Uh, yes? May I help you, miss?

763
01:00:40,337 --> 01:00:42,770
Where's Boomer?

764
01:00:42,839 --> 01:00:46,274
Who did you say you were looking for? Boomer?

765
01:00:46,343 --> 01:00:49,911
There must be a mistake.
I was here earlier today.

766
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,513
<i>- Boomer!</i>
- Barbara.

767
01:00:52,582 --> 01:00:55,283
I wish you would leave.
I'm just here with my boyfriend.

768
01:00:55,352 --> 01:00:58,253
- Boomer, where are you?
- Here we go again.

769
01:00:58,321 --> 01:01:00,922
Hey, Boomer! Are you here? Wait!

770
01:01:02,025 --> 01:01:04,325
<i>Hello.</i>

771
01:01:04,394 --> 01:01:06,327
<i>Do you know this woman?</i>

772
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:10,932
What are you doing? And what
kind of girl do you think I am?

773
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:17,005
What is it? Keung says bring
his case to the docks...

774
01:01:17,073 --> 01:01:21,175
because if you don't, Tyson will be a goner.

775
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:23,477
<i>Well, who is she?</i>

776
01:01:23,546 --> 01:01:27,415
What's wrong with you? I thought you cared!

777
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:30,785
And now I find you here with this woman!

778
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:33,354
<i>You're just a goddamn loser!</i> Hey, wait a minute.

779
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:36,190
I've had enough. Who is she?

780
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:39,227
- Barbara.
- And what's<i> her</i> name?

781
01:01:39,296 --> 01:01:42,563
- She's Tammy.
- His fiancee.

782
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:45,866
And we're going to get married.
You're getting married?

783
01:01:45,936 --> 01:01:49,637
Wait, Barbara! You promised me, remember?

784
01:01:49,705 --> 01:01:51,940
You're not going back on your word?

785
01:01:52,008 --> 01:01:55,209
"Just close your eyes and
imagine." Did you tell her that?

786
01:01:55,278 --> 01:01:57,812
But we agreed on a spring wedding!

787
01:01:57,880 --> 01:02:02,583
There is something important you should know.

788
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:04,752
Boomer!

789
01:02:04,821 --> 01:02:06,754
Where are you?

790
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:09,523
Boomer! Where are you?

791
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:11,659
He could be behind here.

792
01:02:11,727 --> 01:02:14,329
<i>Yes, he's just afraid he will
scare you girls. That's why.</i>

793
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:17,198
<i>Come on out! Uh-oh.</i>

794
01:02:17,267 --> 01:02:21,402
You'll see. Boomer!

795
01:02:21,471 --> 01:02:24,638
I know you're there. Come on!

796
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:28,142
Oh, no. I think I'm losing my mind.

797
01:02:33,016 --> 01:02:35,016
Uh, I...

798
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:41,155
Wait! I know! TV!

799
01:02:44,594 --> 01:02:46,594
Yes!

800
01:02:49,632 --> 01:02:51,866
Uh... Huh?

801
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:59,440
He's real.

802
01:03:04,047 --> 01:03:06,881
Boomer, Tyson's in trouble.
You have to find Keung, quick.

803
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:11,952
- If I only knew where he was hiding.
- Wait. At the shipyard.

804
01:03:12,022 --> 01:03:15,222
- <i> And you're supposed to bring the briefcase to him.</i>
- Then you look after them.

805
01:03:15,225 --> 01:03:18,692
Hold it! Aren't you coming back?

806
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:21,062
If I survive, I will.

807
01:03:26,819 --> 01:03:29,220
Excuse me. Come to the conference
room for the pictures.

808
01:03:29,289 --> 01:03:31,289
Thank you for your cooperation.

809
01:03:33,492 --> 01:03:35,559
Hello.

810
01:03:38,064 --> 01:03:39,997
Ah, Maestro!

811
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:48,272
Ah, Maestro! Sir.

812
01:03:51,344 --> 01:03:53,844
Ah, Maestro!

813
01:03:55,648 --> 01:03:57,581
Boomer...

814
01:03:57,650 --> 01:04:00,017
We should be like brothers, we're so alike.

815
01:04:01,620 --> 01:04:04,055
Fate is a funny thing. Know what I mean?

816
01:04:04,123 --> 01:04:07,291
'Cause if I had as many breaks as you,

817
01:04:07,360 --> 01:04:09,793
I could have turned out pretty good.

818
01:04:09,862 --> 01:04:14,465
I'm honored to know someone as loyal as you.

819
01:04:14,533 --> 01:04:17,034
Let's take care of this together,

820
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:19,103
as brothers.

821
01:04:21,941 --> 01:04:24,041
Let's go get Tyson.

822
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:58,226
How do you do? Shut up. We're wastin' time.

823
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:32,760
<i>Good to see you again.
Will, bring the briefcase here.</i>

824
01:05:32,829 --> 01:05:34,789
I'll take that. Hey, hey!

825
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:37,181
- I have a bomb.
- Hand that over!

826
01:05:37,249 --> 01:05:40,384
All of you, back off! Stand back!
It's full of explosives.

827
01:05:40,453 --> 01:05:43,954
Do you hear me? Don't come near me!
If I drop it, we all die.

828
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:54,482
I'll check the other side. Yeah. Fine.

829
01:05:57,753 --> 01:05:59,853
What are you looking at, huh?

830
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:17,588
- Where's Tyson?
- He's up there.

831
01:06:17,656 --> 01:06:20,591
- Safe and sound.
- <i> Help! Boomer, help me!</i>

832
01:06:22,828 --> 01:06:25,429
Up here!

833
01:06:25,498 --> 01:06:28,099
<i>Are you really Tyson?</i>

834
01:06:28,167 --> 01:06:33,070
<i>Don't kid around, Boomer!</i> Can you
say something to prove who you are?

835
01:06:33,139 --> 01:06:36,099
<i>Yeah! When we were kids...</i> Take a closer look.

836
01:06:41,231 --> 01:06:45,233
<i>He's such a crack-up. Ain't he?</i>

837
01:06:45,301 --> 01:06:47,217
Yeah.

838
01:06:51,907 --> 01:06:56,244
Hand over the briefcase, huh? Or good-bye
to your buddy. Know what I mean?

839
01:07:07,106 --> 01:07:09,507
Move over!

840
01:07:09,575 --> 01:07:13,711
Hey, boss! There's another guy!
Boss, we got trouble!

841
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:16,213
Oh, what's with this? Boomer, help!

842
01:07:19,051 --> 01:07:21,552
Help me!

843
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:26,823
That was your last chance.

844
01:07:26,892 --> 01:07:29,793
Oh, what have I done?

845
01:07:32,198 --> 01:07:35,832
That was close.

846
01:07:35,901 --> 01:07:37,935
Oh, m... Gimme that!

847
01:07:39,772 --> 01:07:42,623
It's a bomb!

848
01:07:44,227 --> 01:07:47,528
Any closer, and this will explode!

849
01:07:47,596 --> 01:07:50,076
All right. I've had about
enough of this. Get him!

850
01:07:52,368 --> 01:07:54,401
Step aside!

851
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:57,338
Wait. Take it easy, boss. I got it.

852
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:02,210
No, wait! Look at that. Huh?

853
01:08:08,233 --> 01:08:10,267
Somebody go check it out.

854
01:08:10,336 --> 01:08:12,603
<i>Go on. Hurry!</i> Come on!

855
01:08:20,646 --> 01:08:24,515
<i>Help me! Put out the fire!</i>

856
01:08:27,920 --> 01:08:30,521
You two, go. Go on! After him!

857
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:52,976
Now what?

858
01:08:53,045 --> 01:08:56,514
<i>Tyson, get out of there!</i>

859
01:09:01,420 --> 01:09:05,956
Let's get out of here! I'm
tryin', but I hurt my leg.

860
01:09:06,025 --> 01:09:09,092
Hey! What the hell? How'd you get here so fast?

861
01:09:09,162 --> 01:09:11,162
What are you talking about? I've
been down here the whole time.

862
01:09:11,230 --> 01:09:13,230
My leg! My leg!

863
01:09:53,772 --> 01:09:57,140
<i>All right. There's eight.</i>

864
01:09:57,210 --> 01:09:59,142
And nine.

865
01:09:59,212 --> 01:10:01,978
Nine... good play. Hey, what's that?

866
01:10:02,047 --> 01:10:04,648
Huh?

867
01:10:04,717 --> 01:10:06,650
Your turn.

868
01:10:06,719 --> 01:10:08,686
Ten.

869
01:10:08,754 --> 01:10:10,754
There is somebody in here.

870
01:10:12,858 --> 01:10:15,092
Come on.

871
01:10:16,262 --> 01:10:18,262
Wait! There really<i> is</i> somebody in here!

872
01:10:18,331 --> 01:10:21,198
I'm not lying! Guys with guns! - Hey, you!

873
01:10:21,267 --> 01:10:25,502
Get your hands up! Card game's over.

874
01:10:25,571 --> 01:10:27,571
Put your head down. Yes, sir.

875
01:10:33,979 --> 01:10:36,480
<i>I think he's gone in!</i>

876
01:10:37,883 --> 01:10:39,883
<i>You were right! Inside!</i>

877
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:44,154
♫

878
01:10:51,930 --> 01:10:54,798
Tyson! Tyson!

879
01:11:01,140 --> 01:11:03,440
Hey, Boom!

880
01:11:09,415 --> 01:11:14,402
<i>Caution. Clear test area. Caution.</i>

881
01:11:14,470 --> 01:11:17,405
Shut the gate! Yeah, boss.

882
01:11:18,974 --> 01:11:20,974
Shh!

883
01:11:30,887 --> 01:11:32,820
Over here! <i>Take him!</i>

884
01:11:40,095 --> 01:11:42,596
Tyson! Tyson!

885
01:11:44,099 --> 01:11:47,935
Hey, here! I'm here, Boomer! I'm here in the car!

886
01:11:48,003 --> 01:11:51,204
Quick! Get in the car! Get inside!
Wait! How are you inside?

887
01:11:51,273 --> 01:11:55,910
- Let's ram our way out!
- The car's raised up! What are we gonna do?

888
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:58,378
Huh?

889
01:11:59,549 --> 01:12:02,583
All right. Check it out. Move it.

890
01:12:02,652 --> 01:12:06,253
I can't see anything. Just shut up. Keep lookin'.

891
01:12:11,494 --> 01:12:13,494
Find anything? Hey! No.

892
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:19,667
Oh, I'm sorry. Bye.

893
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:24,638
There you are. Get him!

894
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:31,645
I'm sorry.

895
01:12:31,714 --> 01:12:34,034
What are you doing? I didn't have much choice.

896
01:12:43,910 --> 01:12:46,877
Don't you come near me!

897
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:48,946
<i>Stand back. Caution.</i>

898
01:12:49,014 --> 01:12:51,081
Ow! Hot!

899
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:53,851
Huh? Boomer?

900
01:12:53,920 --> 01:12:56,737
- <i> Am I glad to see you!</i>
- Shh!

901
01:12:56,806 --> 01:13:00,340
Ya chicken, come over here. I'll kick your ass!

902
01:13:00,409 --> 01:13:02,242
<i>Come on. Come on!</i> Shut up!

903
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:05,212
You want some of this? Boomer, get him.
Get him! Chicken!

904
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:08,065
<i>I'll show you!</i>

905
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:11,368
Hey!

906
01:13:11,437 --> 01:13:14,371
Here! Come on over here.

907
01:13:14,440 --> 01:13:17,224
Hit him, Boomer! Hit him! Come on!

908
01:13:17,292 --> 01:13:19,860
<i>You're gonna get it now, Tough guy!</i>

909
01:13:19,929 --> 01:13:22,229
That's it! Form and balance.

910
01:13:22,297 --> 01:13:25,398
♫

911
01:13:27,119 --> 01:13:29,002
What's wrong with you?

912
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:34,241
Hey, what are you doin'? Kick him in the head!

913
01:13:35,844 --> 01:13:38,212
<i>Boomer, come back here!</i>

914
01:13:40,249 --> 01:13:43,769
You should be able to kill this guy.
Something wrong?

915
01:13:45,221 --> 01:13:49,306
Get up! You're fighting like a girl.
My grandmother could beat this guy!

916
01:13:51,477 --> 01:13:55,913
<i>Hey, I was kidding. I don't even
have a grandmother. Oh, no!</i>

917
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:04,588
- Are you okay?
- Tyson's in trouble! You've got to help him!

918
01:14:35,187 --> 01:14:38,805
- Time out! Time out!
- Hey, you! Bastard!

919
01:14:38,874 --> 01:14:40,624
Pick on someone your own size!

920
01:14:42,594 --> 01:14:45,162
Hey, I'm gonna tell you one last...

921
01:14:52,021 --> 01:14:57,024
Oh, wow! Finish this loser off
and I'll go turn off the heat.

922
01:15:00,129 --> 01:15:04,331
<i>Caution. Lowering heat apparatus.</i>

923
01:15:09,905 --> 01:15:12,940
Hey, look out, Boomer! It's comin' down!

924
01:15:13,859 --> 01:15:16,627
What are you trying to do? Kill me?

925
01:15:16,696 --> 01:15:20,530
You know, it's too hot in here. You take
care of that guy and I'll cool off in here.

926
01:15:23,603 --> 01:15:26,704
Ah, heaven! Huh?

927
01:15:26,772 --> 01:15:30,074
You were in there! Never mind. Just run.

928
01:15:31,911 --> 01:15:35,212
Come on! This one's a pushover! Who's a pushover?

929
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:38,949
Boomer! Help me!

930
01:15:39,018 --> 01:15:41,218
<i>Boomer!</i>

931
01:15:42,972 --> 01:15:45,505
<i>Boomer!</i> Run away!

932
01:15:45,574 --> 01:15:46,974
Okay.

933
01:15:48,944 --> 01:15:50,944
Wait! Haven't you finished?

934
01:15:57,086 --> 01:15:59,669
Hey, I'll finish him. Watch while I do it, okay?

935
01:16:06,528 --> 01:16:09,229
Hiya!

936
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:11,298
Tyson!

937
01:16:14,569 --> 01:16:17,804
Please don't hit me.

938
01:16:19,808 --> 01:16:21,608
- Boomer?
- Run!

939
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:31,084
This way!

940
01:16:31,153 --> 01:16:33,753
<i>- Don't move!
- We got 'em now.</i>

941
01:17:12,511 --> 01:17:15,612
Oh, my God! Boomer, let's get
the hell out of here now!

942
01:17:35,401 --> 01:17:38,034
Boomer!

943
01:17:51,883 --> 01:17:54,784
- I owe you one.
- Come on.

944
01:17:58,890 --> 01:18:02,226
I'll just stay in here until
you're finished. Hurry up!

945
01:18:14,540 --> 01:18:16,540
Get him!

946
01:20:11,823 --> 01:20:14,391
Huh?

947
01:20:14,460 --> 01:20:17,060
Heads down!

948
01:20:23,201 --> 01:20:25,201
Get off me or you'll die!

949
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:29,873
Look out!

950
01:20:36,782 --> 01:20:39,549
Tyson!

951
01:20:41,136 --> 01:20:43,920
Tyson, get up, will ya!

952
01:20:43,989 --> 01:20:47,307
<i>Recorded speed of 50 miles per hour.</i>

953
01:20:47,376 --> 01:20:51,711
<i>Estimated survival rate for passengers
with seat belts: Ninety-nine percent.</i>

954
01:20:51,780 --> 01:20:56,766
- Tyson!
- I had the seat belt on! I'm gonna be okay!

955
01:20:58,403 --> 01:21:02,639
I'm gonna kick your ass! <i>I've
had enough, please! No more!</i>

956
01:21:02,708 --> 01:21:05,107
I-I-I'll make a deal. Anything you want.

957
01:21:05,176 --> 01:21:07,176
Take him!

958
01:21:31,903 --> 01:21:34,136
I gotcha! Say your prayers, buddy.

959
01:21:35,607 --> 01:21:38,140
Boomer!

960
01:21:39,043 --> 01:21:41,077
No way.

961
01:21:47,652 --> 01:21:51,471
Hey! There's two of them! But only one can fight!

962
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:54,474
So which one do I have? Guess.

963
01:21:54,543 --> 01:21:56,943
Ooh, I think I got the fighter.

964
01:22:01,816 --> 01:22:03,816
That's enough!

965
01:22:25,240 --> 01:22:28,141
He's not Boomer! He cannot fight you!
Why don't you come fight me?

966
01:22:35,417 --> 01:22:37,517
Look behind you!

967
01:22:42,491 --> 01:22:45,858
Turn around! John! Behind you!

968
01:22:59,708 --> 01:23:03,710
I move, he moves. Hit him! Hit him!

969
01:23:03,778 --> 01:23:05,978
<i>Hit him! Harder!</i>

970
01:23:06,047 --> 01:23:08,315
Turn around!

971
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:18,407
Kick him! Kick!

972
01:23:18,477 --> 01:23:21,010
Turn around! Kick!

973
01:23:39,381 --> 01:23:41,514
I'm not done with you.

974
01:23:46,371 --> 01:23:48,304
So, tell me: Which one am I, actually?

975
01:23:48,373 --> 01:23:50,373
John Ma. Who do you think?

976
01:23:50,441 --> 01:23:54,277
I wasn't really sure,
'cause when I was fighting...

977
01:23:54,346 --> 01:23:57,446
Cut the crap! Open it up!

978
01:24:01,887 --> 01:24:03,887
Where's Tyson?

979
01:24:06,724 --> 01:24:09,525
Stop there!

980
01:24:09,594 --> 01:24:12,528
- There are two of you!
- There's just one of us.

981
01:24:12,597 --> 01:24:14,730
- Just one?
- Must be seeing things.

982
01:24:19,404 --> 01:24:22,372
Ah. Get on the ground! Move it!

983
01:24:24,742 --> 01:24:26,742
There are two of you!

984
01:24:34,085 --> 01:24:36,819
- <i> Proceed test.</i>
- John!

985
01:24:38,757 --> 01:24:42,458
Where's the seat belt?

986
01:24:46,565 --> 01:24:50,399
<i>Estimated survival rate of passenger
without seat belt: Zero percent.</i>

987
01:24:50,468 --> 01:24:52,569
<i>Please replace test dummy.</i>

988
01:24:57,025 --> 01:24:59,526
<i>It's so beautiful!</i>

989
01:25:06,167 --> 01:25:08,735
What's holding them up so long?

990
01:25:08,803 --> 01:25:13,206
I'm very anxious to meet the man who looks
like John. I hope he really is our son.

991
01:25:13,275 --> 01:25:15,675
Now, Mama. Don't get your hopes up too high.

992
01:25:15,744 --> 01:25:17,877
You promised. Yes, of course. I won't, dear.

993
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:20,046
Father, Mother.

994
01:25:20,115 --> 01:25:23,116
I still haven't seen Boomer.
I don't know where he is.

995
01:25:25,153 --> 01:25:28,921
- I'm afraid the wedding will have to be cancelled.
- Cancelled?

996
01:25:28,990 --> 01:25:31,324
Wait here. I have to find Boomer.

997
01:25:32,694 --> 01:25:35,495
John, where are you going? There he is!

998
01:25:35,564 --> 01:25:37,997
Hey, come back here! John!

999
01:25:42,036 --> 01:25:45,238
- Where have you been?
- Did you have to bring the whole crowd?

1000
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:48,387
I can't believe it... our son! That's our boy?

1001
01:25:49,811 --> 01:25:51,745
Oh!

1002
01:25:51,813 --> 01:25:55,148
What do we do? We get outta
here right now. Let's go.

1003
01:25:55,216 --> 01:25:59,018
Are you all right? They're getting away! Come on!

1004
01:26:01,423 --> 01:26:03,423
I got you! Are you Boomer or John?

1005
01:26:03,492 --> 01:26:06,493
You're not getting away <i>that</i> easy. Come on!

1006
01:26:10,715 --> 01:26:13,783
That one's Boomer. No, that's Boomer...

1007
01:26:13,852 --> 01:26:15,652
<i>Or is it John?</i>

1008
01:26:15,720 --> 01:26:17,820
Tell me, which one of you is John?

1009
01:26:21,960 --> 01:26:24,360
You are!

1010
01:26:28,433 --> 01:26:32,301
<i>Now</i> what do we do? It doesn't
make any difference!
