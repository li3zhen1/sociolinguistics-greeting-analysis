大人 您何不亲自拜访呢
My lord, let's visit him in person.

127
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:24,804
王八蛋
Son of a bitch.

128
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,217
你为什么不早说
Why didn't you say anything earlier?

129
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,724
害我喝了一晚上的闷酒
It's your fault I've been drinking alone!

130
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,313
怎么这么远啊
Hey, could it be any farther?

131
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:35,440
我快累死了
I'm so fucking tired.

这也能叫做房子
You call this a hut?

142
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:56,544
大人 应该是吧
I'm guessing this is it.

00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:57,837
不是就要你好看
If it isn't, you're screwed!

144
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:01,049
师爷
Advisor,

145
00:14:01,424 --> 00:14:02,628
这怎么能住人呢
how could someone live in this hut?

146
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:04,093
当茅坑还差不多啊
I'd say it's a toilet!

147
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:06,512
大人
My lord, my lord!

148
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:09,469

The Cho Lo Residence.

149
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,054
这间肯定不是茅坑
-What is it? -I'm sure this is not a toilet

150
00:14:11,059 --> 00:14:11,893
你闻过啊
You sniffed around?

151

上面有写啊 您看
It's written here, see?

王八蛋
Go to hell!

You know I'm illiterate!

154

Hey, when did I get that extra title?

162

It's trendy to exaggerate.

163

嫌茶叶不好吗
is the tea not to your liking?

203

死老头 居然敢用障眼法来迷惑本官
You old weasel, how dare you try to fool me with your illusions!

不给你点颜色瞧瞧你当我是鳖十 拿刀来
How dare you take me for a fool just because I'm polite! I better stay back.

这一招啊 叫横扫干军
This style is called Horizontal Sweep of a Thousand Troops.

师爷 那个软趴趴的什么家伙

还不是破绳镖嘛 没什么杀伤力的
Some sort of rope dart, but not very lethal.

218
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,001
早说你不识货
You're as ignorant as you look.

219
00:18:05,376 --> 00:18:07,920
这个东西的名称叫缨枪
This is a dart javelin.

软趴趴的还叫缨枪
Your javelin seems awfully soft.

师傅 借你的神水用用吧
Sifu, could I borrow some Magic Water?

222

省点用 很难练的
Be frugal, it's hard to make.

223
00:18:19,974 --> 00:18:20,808

师傅
Sifu

238
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:09,185
孩子

你用障眼法来迷惑我 你以为我会怕你啊
You think just because you look big that I'll be scared?

240
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:12,568
大人
My lord,

241
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:14,195
搞错了
it's not

242
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,193
不是他们变大了 是你变小了
that they've gotten bigger. You've gotten smaller!

243
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:19,075
这不是障眼法啊
This isn't an illusion.

244
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:21,911
看看谁踩谁
Let's see who gets crushed now!

下官拜服

-最近皇上 -不用说了
His Majesty--

256
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:56,904
马大人既然这么有决心
My lord has proven his dedication,

257
00:19:56,946 --> 00:19:58,739
草庐就舍命陪君子
I'll do whatever I can to help.

258
00:19:59,365 --> 00:20:00,611
不过有个条件
But I have one condition.

259
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,701
什么条件你说
I'll do anything!

260
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:04,537
你肯不肯牺牲
Will you sacrifice

261
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:06,580
牺牲什么 色相啊
Sacrifice what? My body?

262
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:08,124
就是你的命
The condition is your life.

263
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,000
我的命
My life...

264
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:14,004
你死后我会作法令你化作金甲神将
After you die, I will transform you into a gold-plated statue.

265
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,881
因为你身为一品武官
Because you are a high-ranking official

266
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,299
有皇气护身
with protection from the Son of Heaven,

267
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:18,884
鬼王拿你没办法
The Demon King cannot harm you.

268
00:20:19,093 --> 00:20:21,429
加上我徒弟 成为我左右护法
Together with my student, you will be my guards.

269
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:23,013
方能消灭鬼王
This is the only way to

270
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:24,890
此外别无他法
eradicate the Demon King.

271
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,226
你只不过是个居士
Hey, you're only a Taoist Priest.

272
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,769
又不是开草药铺
You're not a pharmacist.

273
00:20:28,978 --> 00:20:30,516
你不要以为我胡言乱语
Don't think I'm bullshitting.

274
00:20:30,521 --> 00:20:32,565
就算你肯死也要我肯陪
Even if you're willing to die, I have to help you.

275
00:20:32,815 --> 00:20:34,275
那才能有个全尸
You must keep your entire corpse.

276
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:36,235
不然你会身首异处
Otherwise your spirit and body will be separated.

277
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:37,945
你考虑清楚
Think it over.

278
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:39,066
要我的命啊
You want my life?

279
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:40,239
我才不那么傻呢
I'd be crazy to listen to you!

280
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:44,201
那只好算草庐有心无力了
Then consider me willing but unable to help.

281
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:45,202
失陪
Goodbye.

282
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:48,998
岂有此理
Nonsense...

283
00:20:49,832 --> 00:20:51,167
-师爷 我们走 -是
-Advisor, let's go. -Yes, sir!

284
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:59,091
这个神水的功用太妙了
This isn't only Magic Water,

285
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,260
带回去可以让我金枪不倒

286
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:04,847
五位夫人
Even if it's improper,

287
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,099
为夫这次要对不起你们了
I have to move you.

288

293
00:21:17,026 --> 00:21:18,319
我喜欢这个
I like this one!

294
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:20,863
不要吵了 反正都是妈妈拿去
You kids are so annoying! They're all mothers, just take one.

295
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,656

这位大爷 干嘛这么急呀
My good sir, what's the rush?

333

一下子要五位姑娘 挑也得挑半天啊
You want five girls! It takes time.

334
00:23:20,983 --> 00:23:22,610
我又不是要选美进宫
I'm not the Emperor looking for concubines here!

335
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:26,030
原来是马大人你呀
Oh, it's you, Lord Ma!

师傅啊 我不懂诶
Sifu, I don't see why

370
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,793
为什么下这么大的功夫在这个呆瓜身上
we're wasting so much energy on him.

你会马上中风 我才不可能呢
You've got a screw loose! You'll die before me!

388
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,171
-马大人 -不要再说了
-Lord Ma, -Enough!

389
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:53,756
又想用障碍法来骗我
You're trying to fool me with illusions again?

我告诉你啊 我从小就是被吓大的
People have been trying to scare me since I was in my mother's womb!

你看看
Take a look.

393

又想骗我
Trying to fool me?

It does look quite like me.

396
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:15,991
像你 他根本就是你
Looks like you? He is you!

397
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:19,782
又在胡说了
Nonsense,

398
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:20,871
那我是谁呢
then who am I?

399
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:22,664

天门开了 我也没办法啊
It's out of my hands, the gates of Heaven are open!

476
00:34:32,988 --> 00:34:35,156
扶桑鬼 还不受死 更待何时

搞什么嘛
Hey, are you kidding me?

487
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,569
用真剑也不说一声 屁股都开花了
Why didn't you warn me he was going to use a real sword?

488
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:14,821
这个老头谁找来的
Hey! Where's this old man from?

好了好了 不要吵了
All right, stop arguing.

495
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:24,748
这种拍法 我怎么来得及赶下一组戏啊
Hey man, at this rate, I'll never make it to the other set.

496
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:25,957
套好招再叫我吧
Figure it out before you call me again.

人也抬上去 直接把人丢下来
Pick the guy up, then throw him down.

504
00:35:41,097 --> 00:35:42,265
好 开始准备了
While we have him, let's get a second shot!

505
00:35:42,891 --> 00:35:44,893
不知道诶 他今天晚上好像有事情哦

这个死老头真是神经病啊 乱打人呢 真是

548
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,657
何方鼠辈 竟敢如此对待本居士

549
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:12,118
-你这家伙倒挺可爱的 -就是啊

告诉你 我们是香港皇家警察
We're the Hong Kong Royal Police!

551
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:19,709
你等如何处置本居士
What will you do with me?

打包上车了 走啊
Put you in a car! Let's go!

553
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:24,839
休得无礼
Where are your manners?

我要见当地的知县
I demand to see the local official!

Can you hear me?

557
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:37,180
神父啊
Father,

558
00:40:37,185 --> 00:40:39,854
那两个不知道什么人 穿的稀奇古怪的
we've no idea who those two are. They're dressed funny too.

559
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:41,648
我怎么叫门他们都不肯开诶
They won't open the door no matter how long I knock.

560
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:44,020
你还送东西给他们吃啊
And you're still feeding them?

561
00:40:44,025 --> 00:40:44,859
你怕不怕
Aren't you afraid?

562
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:48,529
神父 我们需不需要报警啊
Father, should we call the police?

563
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:52,325
我们无所不在的主连魔鬼都宽恕
If our Almighty God has space in his heart for demons,

564
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:54,369
何况他们还是人呢
who are we to disagree?

565
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:56,871
这么小的字眼睛会看坏的
The characters are so small... Bad for my eyes.

566
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:00,124
什么书啊
What kind of book is this?

567
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,377
我怎么看也看不懂呢
I don't understand a single word.

568
00:41:03,044 --> 00:41:03,878
不看了
I give up.

569
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:06,798
这里又不知道是什么地方
Where are we?

570
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,676
师傅也不晓得在哪里
And where is Sifu?

我早就说过了
I told you,

572
00:41:12,387 --> 00:41:14,430
你这个三寸钉有什么脑筋啊
you have a screw loose somewhere.

573
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,099
这是扶桑鬼的幻觉
We're in the Demon King's illusion.

574
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,477
这样饿下去啊
At this rate,

575
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:21,854
今天不饿死 明天一定死定了
even if we don't die today, we'll die tomorrow.

576
00:41:22,188 --> 00:41:23,648
你早就死掉了
You're dead already!

577
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,149
你现在是天神诶
You're a god!

578
00:41:25,525 --> 00:41:29,737
你没听说过 天神嗅其气 凡人食其味
Gods inhale delicious smells, people eat delicious foods.

579
00:41:29,946 --> 00:41:31,447
你怎么会肚子饿呢
Why would you get hungry?

580
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:49,585
小弟兄 肚子饿了吧
Hey little guy, you must be hungry.

581
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:50,633

不要客气 吃啊
Go on, take it!

585
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:04,147
师兄啊 你知不知道你为什么长不高
Sihing, Do you know why you're so short?

586
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:05,606
你吃独食
Because you eat alone.

587
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:08,484
不是说了吗 神只要闻闻味道
I told you gods inhale delicious smells.

588
00:42:09,068 --> 00:42:10,778
我委屈点让你闻闻好啦
Here, I'll let you smell it,

589
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,281
怎么样啊
alright?

590
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,579
现在是不是感觉很饱啊
How is it? Do you feel less hungry?

591
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:20,450
师兄
Sihing,

592
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:22,040
我一点感觉都没有啊
it's not working...

593
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:23,828
那对不起了 我帮不了你忙了
Sorry, I guess I can't help.

594
00:42:23,833 --> 00:42:24,459
师兄
Sihing...

595
00:42:25,001 --> 00:42:26,669
我发现了一个问题诶
I've discovered a problem.

596

我现在深深的体会到 感觉到 领略到
I feel it very very deeply in my body

598
00:42:31,299 --> 00:42:32,675
做人比做神好
it's better to be a man than a god, come!

599
00:42:33,259 --> 00:42:34,385
你太贼了
Hey! No cheating!

600
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:35,465
-说好不能吃的 -给我咬一口
You can't eat this! Just sniff it!

601
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,971
我再让你闻一下好了
I'll let you smell it again.

602
00:42:42,810 --> 00:42:44,062

也不是施施
Nor am I Sisi.

786
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:04,450
我是GIGI
My name is Gigi.

787
00:54:07,327 --> 00:54:09,032
我是这家医院的心理医生
I'm a psychiatrist here.

788
00:54:09,037 --> 00:54:10,581
我们会尽量帮助你的
I will do my best to help you.

789
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:19,882
大家都是同道中人
Since we're cut from the same cloth,

790
00:54:20,549 --> 00:54:21,712
没必要绑着我
why keep me tied up?

791
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:24,261
你放心 他们等下就会放你的
Don't worry, they'll let you go soon enough.

792
00:54:25,012 --> 00:54:25,846
你不要害怕
No need to be so afraid.

793
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:29,892
你
You...

794
00:54:30,476 --> 00:54:31,935
是不是很讨厌电视啊
Do you really hate TV?

795
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:34,646
还是讨厌里面的画面
Or do you hate the image?

796
00:54:42,738 --> 00:54:43,572
幻术箱
Illusion box?

797
00:55:23,946 --> 00:55:25,155
你快点下来啊
Come down!

798
00:55:25,239 --> 00:55:27,074
你在上面那样子很危险的
That's dangerous!

799
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:28,617
你赶快下来啊
Come down now!

800
00:55:39,837 --> 00:55:40,796
怎么样没事吧
Are you alright?

801
00:55:41,213 --> 00:55:42,047
快起来吧
Here's let's get you up.

802
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:50,430
你不是妖姬就肯定是施施
If you're not a demon, then you're Sisi.

803
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,516
不过我觉得很奇怪
But when did you achieve this level of Tao?

804
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:55,227
你的道行什么时候练得这么高
With a mere wave of your hand,

805
00:55:55,811 --> 00:55:57,187
竟然不费吹灰之力
you were able to

806
00:55:57,437 --> 00:55:59,606
能将鬼王呼之则来挥之则去
summon and dismiss the Demon King.

807
00:56:01,275 --> 00:56:02,568
其实我也很想知道
Actually, I'd also like to know

808
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:04,314
你为什么一下子叫我施施
why do you sometimes called me "Sisi"

809
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:05,863
一下子又叫我妖姬呢
and sometimes a demon?

810
00:56:06,113 --> 00:56:07,155
能不能告诉我
Can you tell me?

811
00:56:07,781 --> 00:56:08,615
可以
Of course.

812
00:56:27,092 --> 00:56:27,968

-Oh, it's you. -Yes.

813

起来吧 叫我老道士就行了
Just call me Taoist Geezer.

817
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:40,058
草庐兄啊
Brother Cho Lo,

818
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:42,185
你不是说你要出去救你徒弟吗
I thought you were going to rescue your students?

819
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:44,067
那我们特别来救你的呀
We came to save you!

820
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:45,944

We brought your belongings.

谢谢各位
Thank you.

822
00:56:48,655 --> 00:56:50,157
大哥 外面没人
Big Brother, there's no one here!

823
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,579
-外面没有人谁都知道啊 -是
Of course there's no one. Even a crazy person could tell.

824
00:56:56,163 --> 00:56:58,916
大大哥啊 你现在就快点走吧
Big-Big Brother, you better get going.

825
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:01,163
门口啊就在外头
The gate is that way.

826
00:57:01,168 --> 00:57:01,622
是啊
Yeah,

827
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:03,498
再晚一点呐 恐怕就来不及了
or it'll be too late!

828
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:04,546
来不及了
Too late!

829
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:06,840
各位兄弟
Brothers,

830
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:08,962
草庐日后一旦找回两个徒弟
once I have found my two students,

831
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:10,510
一定会来救你们出去
I will be back to rescue you.

832
00:57:13,639 --> 00:57:14,681
才不要
Please don't!

833
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:16,308
怕怕
Scary, scary!

834
00:57:17,392 --> 00:57:21,188
外面的人比我们还傻
People out there are crazier than we are!

835
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:25,025
外面啊 江湖险恶
It's dangerous out there! Here, take this.

836
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,027
这个你就先带着吧
you don't need to fold courier pigeons anymore!

837
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:29,149
是啊 你先拿着吧
Yeah, with this,

838
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:31,782
以后啊 你就不用折纸鸟了
You won't have to origami birds anymore

839
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:33,033
对对对
Yeah!

Hey, Gigi, why so late tonight?

855
00:58:16,076 --> 00:58:17,531
是啊 本来很早就可以走的
I was planing on leaving earlier,

856
00:58:17,536 --> 00:58:18,991
后来跟一个病人谈点事情
but I ended up speaking with a patient

857
00:58:18,996 --> 00:58:20,122
所以耽误到现在
for a very long time.

858
00:58:20,706 --> 00:58:22,624
GIGI 你的行李箱没有关好诶
Gigi, your trunk isn't closed.

859

Still pretty cute.

Not bad...

869

什么时候上了我的车 我都不知道
How did you get in here without me knowing?

870

According to the information from Psychiatry, there may be some issues.

879
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:21,571
我看最好还是等开会的时候

我打电话到医院去 你也不肯接
You won't answer when I call the hospital.

887
01:00:37,134 --> 01:00:39,386
我告诉你 你这样做是没用的
Your resistance is futile. Let me tell you--

945
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:10,407
就放在桌子上
I left it on the table.

946
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:41,187
你前世乃宜水县施家镇人
In your past life, your name was Sisi.

947
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:42,689
原名叫施施
Hailing from Sika County.

948
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:46,234
被鬼王山的扶桑鬼垂涎迫婚
You were forced to marry the Demon King.

949
01:05:46,860 --> 01:05:49,779
父母双双死于鬼王淫威之下
The Demon King killed both your parents.

950
01:05:50,697 --> 01:05:53,158
而你为了挽救全镇的百姓
In exchange for the safety of the entire county,

951
01:05:53,867 --> 01:05:55,452
所以忍辱下嫁
you agreed to marry him.

952
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:58,538
在途中你想刺杀鬼王
Your attempt to murder him failed.

953
01:05:58,997 --> 01:05:59,956
结果失败
He stole your soul,

954
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:02,292
最后还让鬼王收服
and ultimately,

955
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:03,835
变成妖姬
you became his demonic concubine.

956
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:22,103
你怎么在这待了一夜啊
You've been here all night?

957
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:23,563
本来想走的
I had planned on leaving,

958
01:06:23,813 --> 01:06:25,523
下了一夜的雨 没有走
but then it rained all night.

959
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:28,568
声音怎么那么沙哑呢
Your voice is cracked.

960
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:31,488
没办法 吠了一夜
Yes, well... I barked all night.

961
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:36,117
那你为什么不上来避避雨
Why didn't you come up to get out of the rain?

962
01:06:37,202 --> 01:06:38,244
不太好
That's improper,

963
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:40,330
男女授受不亲
Men and women

964
01:06:41,164 --> 01:06:42,624
何况同处一室
should keep a distance.

965
01:06:44,918 --> 01:06:47,253
昨天晚上真不好意思啊
I'm sorry about last night.

966
01:06:47,587 --> 01:06:48,505
没关系
It's fine.

967
01:06:51,466 --> 01:06:53,176
地上怎么会有那么多纸鹤啊
Why are there so many paper cranes on the ground?

968
01:06:53,635 --> 01:06:56,638
这些纸鹤是我用来跟徒弟通消息用的
It's my method of communicating with my students.

969
01:06:56,971 --> 01:06:57,972
你知道吗
You know what?

970
01:06:58,223 --> 01:06:59,474
我的法术啊
But my powers

971
01:07:00,391 --> 01:07:02,352
一遇到雨水就会失灵的
are useless in the rain.

972
01:07:03,436 --> 01:07:03,978
对了
Oh, yes.

973
01:07:04,479 --> 01:07:06,439
我收到我徒弟的消息
Their last message said they were at the local lord's residence.

974
01:07:06,940 --> 01:07:08,775
知不知道主上之家在哪里
Do you know where the local lord lives?

975
01:07:10,235 --> 01:07:11,653
主上之家
The lord's residence?

976
01:07:12,195 --> 01:07:13,780
我去问问人家才知道
Let me ask around,

977
01:07:14,364 --> 01:07:15,990
你放心 我会帮你找的
I'll help you look.

978
01:07:16,074 --> 01:07:18,488
对了 外面的人到处都在找你
Oh yes, they're looking for you.

979
01:07:18,493 --> 01:07:20,787
你还是先到我家里面去避一下
You better stay at mine today.

980
01:07:20,828 --> 01:07:23,039
这是我大门的钥匙 你会不会用啊
Do you know how to use my keys?

981
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:24,832
会 我看你开过
Yes, I saw you use it.

982
01:07:25,166 --> 01:07:25,875
这一支
It's this one.

983
01:07:27,293 --> 01:07:28,545
那我先回医院去了
I have to get to the hospital.

984
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:36,427
你还在那边干嘛
Hey! Why are you still standing around?

985
01:07:36,469 --> 01:07:38,805
今天晚上我一定会陪你去找你徒弟的
I promise to help you look for your students tonight, okay?

986
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:39,847
OK
Okay!

987
01:07:43,184 --> 01:07:43,977
OK
Okay!

988
01:07:52,110 --> 01:07:53,820
你到底行不行啊
Your transfiguration skills suck!

989
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:56,322
放了一整天了 没有半只飞上天的
You've been at it all day, and nothing flies.

990
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:58,861
大清早的你鸡毛子喊叫的
Hey, it's still early!

991
01:07:58,866 --> 01:08:00,868
再怎么说我小龟也是你师兄啊
I'm still your sihing, show some respect!

992
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:03,246
师兄 师你妈个头啦
Sihing? What a load of crap!

993
01:08:04,122 --> 01:08:05,285
你要搞清楚啊
If it

994
01:08:05,290 --> 01:08:06,369
要不是下一场大雨
weren't for the rain

995
01:08:06,374 --> 01:08:08,626
我小龟怎么会在你面前丢人呢
every single one of them would fly!

996
01:08:10,628 --> 01:08:12,292
有句话说的很有道理啊
There's a saying that makes sense

997
01:08:12,297 --> 01:08:13,751
拉不出屎来怪茅房
A bad workman blames his tools!

998
01:08:13,756 --> 01:08:15,425
这句话最适合你了
That phrase was made for you!

999
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:16,884
我老实告诉你好了
Don't you know

1000
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:19,215
师傅的法术最忌讳碰到水
our powers don't work

1001
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:20,633
只要一碰到水就破法了
in the rain!?

1002
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:21,593
你搞清楚了没有
Get it?

1003
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:22,849
师兄 你说完啦
Sihing, are you done?

1004
01:08:23,016 --> 01:08:23,808
说完了
Yes.

1005
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:25,054
你说完了
Good,

1006
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:26,723
我已经饿的前胸贴后背了
because I'm hungrier than a dead dog.

1007
01:08:26,728 --> 01:08:28,396
拜托 你救救我好不好
I beg you, save me!

1008
01:08:29,147 --> 01:08:30,356
师兄
"Sihing"

1009
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:33,818
南无阿弥陀佛
Namo Amitabha?

1010
01:08:35,903 --> 01:08:36,654
有了
I've got a plan!

1011
01:08:48,750 --> 01:08:49,787
谢谢
At home,

1012
01:08:49,792 --> 01:08:51,085
在家靠父母
you rely on your brothers.

1013
01:08:51,586 --> 01:08:53,004
出外靠朋友
Out in the world, you rely on your friends!

1014
01:08:56,049 --> 01:08:59,677
今天我们路过贵宝地 欠缺盘缠
Today, we have journeyed into your fair town

1015
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:02,550
有钱的捧个钱场 没钱的捧个人场 谢谢
seeking nothing but two small meals.

1016
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:05,266
刚才我师弟表演那两下没有什么
We're just warming up!

1017
01:09:05,516 --> 01:09:07,435
好戏还在后头呢
We've saved the best for last.

1018
01:09:09,019 --> 01:09:10,937
他为什么躺着?
Why is he lying down?

1019
01:09:14,816 --> 01:09:16,526
他能举起那块厚板吗?
Can he even lift that slab?

1020
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:19,155
闪到一边去
Get off.

1021
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:24,702
你到底行不行啊
This strongman is more like it!

1022
01:09:26,995 --> 01:09:28,037
他全身都是红色的!
He's all red!

1023
01:09:29,082 --> 01:09:30,625
这种事可不是闹着玩的
Can he really handle it?

1024
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,460
出了人命怎么办哦
Don't kill anyone!

1025
01:09:32,877 --> 01:09:34,170
你可得小心点
He can't even lift the hammer!

1026
01:09:48,809 --> 01:09:50,060
拉屎！
Get shit!

1027
01:09:52,105 --> 01:09:53,189
你给我躺下
Lie down!

1028
01:09:57,735 --> 01:10:00,196
师弟啊 你留心点啊
Be careful, Sidai!

1029
01:10:00,279 --> 01:10:01,489
打不碎不要钱
No charge if I don't break it in one go!

1030
01:10:01,863 --> 01:10:02,822
让我们看看这个
Let's see this!

1031
01:10:03,574 --> 01:10:04,492
师弟
Sidai!

1032
01:10:07,495 --> 01:10:08,329

起来起来
Get up!

1039
01:10:36,274 --> 01:10:38,067
街头卖艺 赚点盘缠啊
Just busking for our next meal...

1040
01:10:38,776 --> 01:10:40,403
你敢消遣我 带走
Busking? Arrest him!

1041
01:10:40,445 --> 01:10:42,321

放开我
Let go of me!

1044
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:53,286
呼叫总部 召集人马 召集人马
Over, over! Backup, backup!

1045
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:55,334
马
Backup?

1046
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:02,884
放开我
Who are you people?

1047
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:05,511
你没事吧
Are you alright?

1048
01:11:06,137 --> 01:11:06,966
师弟啊
Let's go.

1049
01:11:06,971 --> 01:11:09,093
银票没有用 白银才值钱呐
Paper money is useless, only silver coins count! Money!

1050
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:09,807
没用
Move!

1051
01:11:18,566 --> 01:11:21,944
师傅
Sifu...

1052
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:25,239
不要叫了 叫的我心都烦啦
Stop... your whining Is driving me crazy.

1053
01:11:25,782 --> 01:11:29,118
-师傅 -好好好 我带你去找师傅嘛
-Sifu... -I'm taking you to sifu now.

1054
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:33,581
你们拍戏啊
Are you crazy?

1055
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:36,370
请问绿水精神病院怎么走
Excuse me, where is the Green Waters Insane Asylum?

1056
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,211
在那边 你们俩去最适合了

我的衣服昨天晚上淋湿了
My clothes were wet.

1071
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:39,040
这电视是你开的吗
You turned on the television?

01:13:39,206 --> 01:13:41,918
是啊 我看过你开那幻术箱我就会开啦

And you had the milk?

1074
01:13:48,132 --> 01:13:50,087

1075
01:13:50,092 --> 01:13:51,093
很好喝诶

1076
01:13:51,302 --> 01:13:53,179
你真是个聪明的古代人呐
You're a smart, ancient man.

1077
01:13:53,387 --> 01:13:55,723
这么快就学会了那么现代化的东西了
You picked everything up so quickly.

1078
01:13:58,017 --> 01:13:58,768
对了
Oh yes,

在公路上看到你徒弟了
I think I saw your two students on the highway.

1081
01:14:02,396 --> 01:14:03,022
真哒
Really?

1082
01:14:03,314 --> 01:14:04,565
你怎么知道是他们
How did you recognise them?

1083
01:14:04,857 --> 01:14:07,401
穿着啊身材啊 都跟你说的一模一样
By their clothing and behavior... just as you said.

1084
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:08,402
你真的见过他们
You really saw them?

1085
01:14:08,986 --> 01:14:09,612
别说了 走吧
Come, let's go find them.

1086
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:12,365
不行啊 我不能这样见他们
No. I can't let them see me like this.

1087
01:14:24,627 --> 01:14:25,711
没看见他们呐
I don't see them.

1088
01:14:25,878 --> 01:14:27,880
我刚刚明明是在这里看到他们的
I saw them around here.

1089

Let's go look over there.

1092
01:14:43,938 --> 01:14:44,939
你干什么
Hey, what are you doing?

1093

1255
01:25:16,445 --> 01:25:17,195
这边 这边
This way...

1256
01:25:17,362 --> 01:25:18,280
找到没有啊
Have you found it yet?

1257
01:25:18,572 --> 01:25:20,032
不对 又到那边去了
No, this way, this way.

1258
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:22,659
这边 这边
No, this way, this way.

1259
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:26,033
你颠来颠去干什么 不会用走的
Hey, shortcake! You're taking us in circles, let's just walk straight.

1260
01:25:26,038 --> 01:25:27,117
你懂个屁啊
What do you know?

1261
01:25:27,122 --> 01:25:28,415
你懂的话你来找
If you knew, you'd navigate!

1262
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:29,328
-叫 -真讨厌
-Follow me! -What a nuisance!

1263
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:30,792
好好 走走走
-Come. -This way, this way.

1264
01:25:32,294 --> 01:25:33,170
这边这边这边
No, that way, that way.

1265
01:25:33,712 --> 01:25:34,796
右边右边右边
Right Right Right

1266
01:25:36,214 --> 01:25:37,544
不对啊 又跑左边来啦
Not quite... This way...

1267
01:25:37,549 --> 01:25:39,968
-你晃来晃去的带我们逛公园啊 -不要吵
-Is this fun for you? -Shut up!

1268
01:25:41,928 --> 01:25:42,721
这里是最安全的
This is the safest spot, stay here.

1269
01:25:43,597 --> 01:25:44,556
找东西给她掩护
Hey, find somewhere to hide her.

1270
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:50,807
-再给你个小的 -躲在里面
-This is for you. -Hide here and don't move.

1271
01:25:50,812 --> 01:25:52,939
-千万不要出来 -躲低一点 低一点啊
-Stay hidden, okay? -Get down.

1272
01:25:53,273 --> 01:25:54,107
快走啊
Let's go.

1273
01:25:56,777 --> 01:25:59,446
师兄啊 师父到现在没来会不会出事啊
Sihing, Sifu is taking so long... What if he's in trouble?

1274
01:25:59,780 --> 01:26:02,324
呆子 师傅武力高强怎么会出事呢
You're crazy, Sifu is so powerful, what could happen to him?

1275
01:26:02,366 --> 01:26:03,445
武力高强有个屁用啊
Even though Sifu is so powerful,

1276
01:26:03,450 --> 01:26:05,494
我两广总督坐车还不是要付钱
we still had to pay for that cab.

1277
01:26:05,911 --> 01:26:08,700
对 如果恶魔来了 师傅还没赶到
That makes me think, what if the demon gets here before Sifu?

1278
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:10,749
我们手无寸铁是会吃亏的
We're unprepared. We'd be at a disadvantage!

1279
01:26:11,208 --> 01:26:13,210
我看啊 还是找个武器防身吧
Let's find something to protect ourselves.

1280
01:26:13,502 --> 01:26:14,252
走
Let's go.

1281
01:26:15,504 --> 01:26:17,167
-师傅 -师傅 我们好担心你
-Sifu! -Sifu, we were so worried!

1282
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:18,632
好了 不要多说马上准备
We have to get to work.

1283
01:26:24,054 --> 01:26:24,721
准备宝镜阵
-Prepare for the Moonlight Mirror ritual! -Yes!

1284
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:31,478
恶魔来了
Here comes the demon!

1285
01:26:37,818 --> 01:26:38,652
宝镜拿出来
Bring out the moonlight mirrors!

1286
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:47,160
小心
Be careful!

1287
01:27:28,785 --> 01:27:29,703
你看我干什么
What do you think I'm doing?

1288
01:27:38,712 --> 01:27:39,546
师兄
Sihing!

1289
01:27:41,840 --> 01:27:42,674
师兄
Sihing...

1290
01:27:43,425 --> 01:27:45,594
-师兄 你没事吧 -才怪
-Are you alright? -It's a miracle

1291
01:27:45,719 --> 01:27:46,715
你以为我是你啊
I'm fine, I'm not you!

1292
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:48,555
块头这么大 还有皇气保护着
You're big, strong, and have the Emperor's protection!

1293
01:28:09,576 --> 01:28:10,243
-摆阵 -是
-To your positions! -Yes!

1294
01:28:12,120 --> 01:28:13,872
-宝镜呢 宝镜呢 -惨了
-Where are the Moonlight Mirrors? -Shit...

1295
01:28:14,706 --> 01:28:15,707
在那边
Over there!

1296
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:49,324
惨了惨了 师傅不能沾水的
We're doomed! Sifu can't get wet!

1297
01:28:49,491 --> 01:28:50,575
怎么办
Now what?

1298
01:29:42,377 --> 01:29:44,421
这样下去 师傅会变形的
If we keep going, Sifu will transform!

1299
01:29:45,005 --> 01:29:46,882
快想想办法啊
Think of something!

1300
01:29:46,923 --> 01:29:48,675
你有皇气 不能打也撑得住啊
Go stall for time, the Emperor's protection should keep you safe.

1301
01:29:49,175 --> 01:29:49,676
行不行啊
Are you sure?

1302
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:50,672
我不知道
I don't know.

1303
01:29:50,677 --> 01:29:51,553
拼一下了
Worth a try!

1304
01:29:53,805 --> 01:29:54,681
好
Alright!

1305
01:30:00,061 --> 01:30:00,937
师傅
Sifu!

1306
01:30:03,481 --> 01:30:04,774
-走开 -我不走
Get out of here!

1307
01:30:05,150 --> 01:30:06,526
-走开 -我不走
-Leave! -No!

1308
01:30:07,319 --> 01:30:08,236
走开啊
-Leave! -No!

1309
01:30:10,155 --> 01:30:11,109
要死也要死在一块
If you die, we'll die together!

1310
01:30:11,114 --> 01:30:12,782
-你走啊 -我不走
-Leave! -No!

1311
01:30:13,283 --> 01:30:15,160
-我不走 -快走
Leave!

1312
01:30:31,927 --> 01:30:33,089
师弟
Sidai!

1313
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:34,429
走啊 走啊
Run, run!

1314
01:30:34,971 --> 01:30:35,805
师弟
Sidai!

1315
01:30:37,432 --> 01:30:38,224
师弟
Sidai!

1316
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:41,394
快走
Run!

1317
01:30:43,939 --> 01:30:45,357
我跟你拼啦
To the death!

1318
01:30:46,399 --> 01:30:47,025
小龟
Little Turtle!

1319
01:31:41,287 --> 01:31:43,373
想不到你真刺杀我
Beloved...

1320
01:31:47,544 --> 01:31:49,212
爱姬
I die by your sword...

1321
01:32:23,121 --> 01:32:24,205
居士
Taoist priest!

1322
01:33:03,495 --> 01:33:04,329
小姐
Miss--

1323
01:33:09,709 --> 01:33:10,668
你没事吧
Are you alright?

1324
01:33:11,878 --> 01:33:12,796
居士
Taoist priest?

1325
01:33:12,962 --> 01:33:13,797
队长
Sir,

1326
01:33:14,798 --> 01:33:16,424
在现场发现了一把东洋刀
we found a Japanese sword at the crime scene.

1327
01:33:16,508 --> 01:33:17,467
有没有伤者
Is anyone injured?

1328
01:33:17,801 --> 01:33:20,428
没有 不过现场像经过世界大战一样
Nope, but the scene is messier than Big Goof's home.

1329
01:33:21,262 --> 01:33:21,971
继续找
Keep looking,

1330
01:33:22,263 --> 01:33:23,014
是 长官
Yes, sir!

1331
01:33:24,432 --> 01:33:25,475
马上封锁现场
Ma Sheung-fung lock down the crime scene.

1332
01:33:25,642 --> 01:33:27,352
-送这位小姐去医院 -是
-Please take this lady to the hospital. -Yes, sir!

1333
01:33:27,519 --> 01:33:28,895
小姐 请跟我来
Miss, please come with me.

1334
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:39,656
漫漫长路

1335
01:33:41,491 --> 01:33:45,870
不堪回首

1336
01:33:48,164 --> 01:33:58,716
剩一个寂寞的人独对天地悠悠

1337
01:34:00,218 --> 01:34:04,389
多少痴缠

1338
01:34:06,349 --> 01:34:10,687
多少烦忧

1339
01:34:12,772 --> 01:34:18,403
叹一声短促如梦

1340
01:34:19,487 --> 01:34:23,283
遗憾却是不休

1341
01:34:25,285 --> 01:34:36,337
爱假如不属于我说什么天长地久

1342
01:34:38,006 --> 01:34:48,099
爱说爱梦说梦一雾已经足够

1343
01:34:50,018 --> 01:34:54,018
爱不是占有爱不能强求

1344
01:34:56,107 --> 01:35:00,403
可以付出可以不能收
