1
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,080
Rot in hell.

2
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,520
Bring me a higher love

3
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:35,700
Bring me a higher love, oh, Lord

4
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,940
Lord, direct my footsteps according to your word

5
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:41,200
and let no sin rule over me.

6
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,780
Thank you for protecting my family.

7
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:46,870
You've kept us free from tragedy and illness

8
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:49,600
and you have given us abundance of wealth.

9
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:50,710
Everything.

10
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:52,860
As long as I have breath in my body

11
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,360
and your spirit in my heart.

12
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,050
I am your servant and your faithful soldier.

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,450
Amen!

14
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:04,390
Now, let's just see. Oh, yeah.

15
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,950
- Oh! - Look in my eyes.

16
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,880
Let me see you.

17
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,560
Where's that higher love

18
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:14,900
Well, every superhero needs a cape, Mama.

19
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,980
Oh, Rose, you hush up. You hear your daughter?

20
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:21,240
Think about it there must be higher love

21
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:25,910
Down in the heart or hidden in the stars above

22
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,080
Push in, camera one. Take camera one.

23
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,900
All right.

24
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,640
Y'all are listening today.

25
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:35,830
Hold steady, camera one. Hold steady.

26
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:39,760
Can you hear me in Hong Kong? From Norway to LA?

27
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:43,750
Can you hear me in Australia? The San Francisco Bay.

28
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:46,840
The Lord is calling on you now. He's waiting on the line.

29
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,830
Are you ready?

30
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,680
Are you ready? Are you ready?

31
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:52,940
'Cause we're running out of time.

32
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:55,440
Everything we rehearsed will be on the teleprompter.

33
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:58,500
- Okay. - Eric, stick to the line.

34
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:01,190
Go get 'em, baby.

35
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,670
I'll see you out there.

36
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,790
- Eric, honey? - Come on, son.

37
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,860
Try to see falling behind

38
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:09,680
Look how far we've come.

39
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,350
25 years. All things are possible in Him.

40
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,450
- In you. - In us.

41
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:17,110
Oh, Lord.

42
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,620
Oh, it's nice of the Reverend to try and upstage me

43
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:22,860
on my own network on today of all days.

44
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,860
He'd be nothing without you.

45
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:29,630
Rose, I think we should get the wings.

46
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:31,200
Be that higher love,

47
00:02:31,370 --> 00:02:34,630
and stick around for an extra special 25th anniversary.

48
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,480
Yeah, that's right!

49
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:37,990
Go on. Show Margaret your love.

50
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,900
And may God bless you now.

51
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,730
And go.

52
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:47,240
Live from Sunshine Studios in beautiful New Orleans.

53
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:52,480
Ladies and gentlemen, Margaret Monreaux!

54
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:58,840
Wow! Hello!

55
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:01,920
On the wings

56
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:03,490
Can you believe that?

57
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,350
Unbelievable.

58
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,760
Hello!

59
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:11,410
Oh, stop that! No!

60
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,260
I did that! Look what they made me do!

61
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,840
Love you!

62
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:22,270
Thank you for those warm, welcoming words.

63
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,090
There is something that I need to say to all of you.

64
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,610
You and the Lord give me the strength to do what I do,

65
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,700
so thank you.

66
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:36,040
Now this mama bear has been starving herself for a month

67
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:39,120
to squeeze into those silly wings.

68
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:44,440
Ladies, I think it's time we all had some fried chicken.

69
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:46,610
Ah, there you go!

70
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,960
Cock on the walk!

71
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,100
That cock better not mess on my carpet.

72
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,020
Bite that apple, baby. Yeah, bite it good.

73
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,120
Sorry, Kansas City Beef. Your card was declined.

74
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:01,240
What? Can you--can you run it again?

75
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,630
- Ginger. - Yeah.

76
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,650
You better go check on your mom.

77
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:05,300
She's watching that TV show again.

78
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,910
Thank you to all my mama bears

79
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,810
for 25 years of support.

80
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,920
She has the perfect pageant wave.

81
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:17,990
When we come back,

82
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,130
I have an exciting announcement--

83
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,240
I was watching that. What are you doing?

84
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,760
- You have to stop. - No.

85
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:28,000
- You're obsessed. - No.

86
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,000
You have a problem.

87
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,510
You know, many in this country say

88
00:04:30,670 --> 00:04:31,990
that people with our morals

89
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,250
are out of touch or even stupid.

90
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,460
Many of our sponsors wish that they didn't need your business.

91
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,920
The time has come

92
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,830
to start shopping in God's light,

93
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,280
so four months from today,

94
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,360
you'll be able to purchase everything from books,

95
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,030
clothing, and groceries online from us.

96
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,770
And we can assure you that every employee,

97
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,180
associate, and vendor...

98
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:59,110
Will share your Christian values.

99
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,200
Did you know that some online retailers

100
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:03,870
offer pornography for their subscribers?

101
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,590
Yeah.

102
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:12,470
Yeah, so next to the bleach in your cart,

103
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:16,050
you got Drunk Teen Girls and Boys Gone Wild.

104
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,390
They even sell a product called Butt Butter.

105
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,710
For every item that you place in your Praise Cart,

106
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:24,990
20% of it will go back to our faith.

107
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:28,560
To charities and organizations on the front lines

108
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:31,070
of God's great commission.

109
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:35,400
My friends, I give you Sunny Club.

110
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,670
Sunny Club, Sunny Club.

111
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,580
Sunny Club, Sunny Club.

112
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,830
- What's the early word? - Valuation's off the charts.

113
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:01,430
You got a real winner with this, Eugene.

114
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,270
I swear that camera loves his face even more than I do.

115
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,100
I'm sorry, Mama.

116
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,680
I know that wasn't the planned speech.

117
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,920
- No. - But I--

118
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,770
Subtlety is the footbridge to integrity.

119
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:14,030
Amen.

120
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,350
True integrity means you're the same in public

121
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,610
as you are in private.

122
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,780
You attract bees with honey,

123
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,430
not Butt Butter.

124
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,120
Walk with me, Eric.

125
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:29,270
I rue the day that Eric married that man's sister.

126
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:31,440
They are family now. We have to treat him as such.

127
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,630
And I do.

128
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,870
Oh, there's my girl!

129
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,390
Why didn't you tell the audience

130
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,620
I designed your outfit?

131
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:39,880
Confidence is silent, honey.

132
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,540
Insecurities, well, they're loud.

133
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:44,190
Coming from the woman with sparks shooting out her ass?

134
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,720
Baby, that's not insecurity. That's show biz.

135
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,390
Mama will give you credit on air Monday morning.

136
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:54,300
- Thank you, Daddy. - Mm-hmm.

137
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,080
Don't encourage her.

138
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,970
She wants Sunny Club to carry that clothing line of hers.

139
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:00,810
I know, it's her dream, Margaret,

140
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,080
and I don't know why we can't just set her up.

141
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:04,980
It isn't wise to give children things

142
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,810
- just 'cause they ask for it. - Mm-hmm.

143
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:14,000
Oh, honey, I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to go.

144
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,340
I'm hopping the jet for D.C. tonight.

145
00:07:16,430 --> 00:07:17,670
- Now? - Yeah.

146
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,130
I was hoping that you and I

147
00:07:19,270 --> 00:07:21,100
would have some time together tonight.

148
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:23,010
Preacher's son but when his daddy...

149
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:25,110
Just as soon as I get back.

150
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:27,770
When they gathered 'round and started talking

151
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,170
That's when Billy...

152
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:32,930
Then he'd look into my eyes

153
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:35,600
Lord knows to my surprise

154
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:37,530
The only one who could ever reach me

155
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:40,030
Was the son of a preacher man

156
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:43,010
Well, plenty more where that came from,

157
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:47,280
because I am one rich son of a bitch.

158
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,800
- * Lord knows he was * - * Ooh yes he was

159
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,300
How well I remember

160
00:07:56,530 --> 00:07:58,810
Taking time to make time

161
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,460
Telling me that he's all mine

162
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,540
Lord have mercy on this sinner.

163
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:08,870
Was the son of a preacher man

164
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,940
Death takes the body,

165
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:27,230
God takes the soul,

166
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:31,170
and faith lets us know that we will meet again.

167
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,090
He was so loved.

168
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:38,590
Memorial services held today

169
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,570
for conservative icon Eugene Monreaux.

170
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:43,260
This comes after weeks of searches

171
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:46,340
in the Louisiana marsh failed to recover his body.

172
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,020
And right now the nation mourns the loss

173
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,020
of the man admired for both his faith

174
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:51,190
and his principles.

175
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,270
Meanwhile the face of the network,

176
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,270
Margaret Monreaux, hasn't been on air in a month.

177
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,590
Mrs. Monreaux!

178
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,370
Margaret, did you know any of the women

179
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:01,180
on the plane with your husband?

180
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,660
Why would somebody ask such a thing?

181
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,540
Ginger Sweet?

182
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,600
You've been served.

183
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,530
Head up nothing gonna take me down

184
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:21,870
I'm so hot!

185
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,040
Hey, Rach.

186
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:24,620
I have to leave for a few days.

187
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:26,540
You're in charge until I get back.

188
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:27,450
Okay!

189
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,230
Let go

190
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:35,070
Ain't no wrong get a little bit wild

191
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,640
The worst thing about being deceived

192
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:39,070
is knowing you weren't worth the truth.

193
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:43,240
How long were you gonna keep his will from me?

194
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:45,850
Margaret, I wanted you to get back on air first.

195
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,490
So I could continue living a lie?

196
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,580
Eugene was lying, not you.

197
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,490
No, we were lying to our audience.

198
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:55,070
We were one. His lie is my lie.

199
00:09:55,170 --> 00:09:57,330
When I think of all the crap that I put up with

200
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,320
to carry on with our mission, keeping this family together,

201
00:10:00,410 --> 00:10:03,150
keeping the lid screwed tight on my honey jar

202
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,750
while he cheated all along.

203
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,160
And you knew.

204
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:09,840
And you can't say you didn't.

205
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,980
Come on. Give me a break, Margaret.

206
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:15,850
I'm sorry I said that.

207
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:18,320
You deserved better from him.

208
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:20,760
And from me.

209
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,450
I knew there were one-night stands,

210
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,120
but I never dreamed there was a child.

211
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,460
Children.

212
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,470
Keep reading.

213
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,970
Son of a bitch!

214
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,060
There a Antonio Rivera here?

215
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,060
I been going up Mooda Chainz

216
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,330
Money got yards, got the range

217
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,640
Check, watch it go yard on the shakes

218
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:09,480
Who the hell's Eugene Monreaux?

219
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,670
Yeah, it's mostly CBD.

220
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,390
It's great for pain management

221
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,240
without all the wiggy-wag and anxiety.

222
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:19,820
Oh, I gotta call you back.

223
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:22,660
It's been so hard to find you

224
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:26,510
Now is the hour, sweet and sour

225
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,830
- Jason Conley? - Yeah, sure.

226
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,090
You've been served.

227
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,520
Thank you.

228
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,020
Hey, do you want a beer?

229
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,770
- Okay. - Okay, great.

230
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:38,930
Come on in.

231
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,510
Mama, what's the emergency?

232
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,940
Why are you smoking?

233
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:47,030
Why are you wearing that glove?

234
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,200
I'm not messing up my nails with nicotine stains.

235
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:53,650
I'm a lady who needs a smoke. I'm not a smoker.

236
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,860
Come downstairs, Margaret.

237
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:56,690
Fine!

238
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:08,300
Your father, he was a good man,

239
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:10,890
but not a faithful man.

240
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,040
He had three children outside this marriage

241
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:15,640
from three different women.

242
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:16,900
- What? - No.

243
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,570
While the majority of Eugene's shares

244
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,050
will go to your mother,

245
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:22,960
he made a provision that 5% be divided

246
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,960
equally between his children,

247
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:27,820
and, well, there are five of you now.

248
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:31,640
- That's not my dad. - Yeah, it kind of was.

249
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:35,060
Your daddy would have a few drinks occasionally

250
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,250
and become remorseful,

251
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,480
and he called me and insists the kids be included

252
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:42,310
and then later he would reinstate the original will

253
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,150
- with no extramarital children. - Oh, my God.

254
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,500
It seems the drinky-poo will was in place

255
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:47,740
at the time of the crash.

256
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:50,670
"Always together makes a family forever."

257
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,600
- What a load of crap. - What a hypocrite.

258
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:54,830
Why didn't you stop this?

259
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,590
I never knew about the kids!

260
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:01,670
He did fess up about that whore in Vegas.

261
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,430
I was so mad,

262
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:06,760
we slept in separate bedrooms for six months,

263
00:13:06,930 --> 00:13:08,620
and he only got handies for six more.

264
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,270
- Oh, Mama! - Okay, Mom.

265
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,120
This can't be legal, especially if he was drunk.

266
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:13,620
I've dealt with a lot of bastards

267
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:14,940
to get where I am.

268
00:13:15,110 --> 00:13:17,250
These three will be no different.

269
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,690
Eric, Reverend Thomas mustn't find out

270
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:21,960
about this, or Becky.

271
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:24,630
You want me to lie to my wife?

272
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,540
- I'm not Dad. - If they find out,

273
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:29,510
it's over.

274
00:13:30,790 --> 00:13:32,620
Well, who the hell are these people?

275
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,810
Somebody gotta

276
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,630
Gotta raise a little hell

277
00:13:48,050 --> 00:13:51,400
Somebody gotta, gotta raise a little hell

278
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:03,820
Which floor?

279
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,820
- Same. - That's good.

280
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,070
- Bro, do you mind? - Sure.

281
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,900
- Knock yourself out, man. - No, dude.

282
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:12,010
Don't smoke that in front of my kid.

283
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,180
Of course I'm not the only one.

284
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,920
I'm Ginger.

285
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:17,830
Apparently I'm your sister.

286
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:26,180
My name is Franklin Lee, in-house counsel,

287
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:28,440
and I'll need your letters and your IDs.

288
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:38,850
You must be Ginger, Antonio, and, uh, Jason.

289
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,710
Well, who's this little cherub?

290
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,040
This is my son, Jesus.

291
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:43,780
Oh, if only somebody

292
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,270
could bottle up the smell

293
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,770
of little babies.

294
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,380
If anybody could have, it would have been Eugene.

295
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:50,720
Well, all right, then.

296
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,370
These are my children, Rose and Eric.

297
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:54,720
Rose?

298
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:56,060
I'm the senior VP of operations,

299
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,470
at least until the dust settles,

300
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,060
and, uh, you know, from my perspective,

301
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,730
there's no way I'm giving a single piece

302
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,470
of my family company to a hooker...

303
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,620
- Hm? - A hoodlum,

304
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:07,050
and a drug dealer.

305
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:07,900
Yo, I'm gonna knock your teeth in, homie.

306
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:10,390
This is my humming bird cake.

307
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:13,810
I made it myself this morning especially for y'all.

308
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:16,630
Back up.

309
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:17,730
I'm not a hooker.

310
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,320
You're not, huh?

311
00:15:19,490 --> 00:15:20,750
Yeah, I pulled up Sin Wagon on my laptop.

312
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:23,310
Nuns, milk maids, farm girls,

313
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,980
doing the most despicable, disgusting things.

314
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,630
So you subscribe to our premium package?

315
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,670
- Jason, you want some tea? - You know what?

316
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,910
I'm okay.

317
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,820
Oh, she won't stop asking until you say yes.

318
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:38,320
- It's what she does. - I'd love some.

319
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,930
Rose.

320
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:43,840
It was, uh, quite a surprise that all of you

321
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,850
were in Eugene's will.

322
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,500
One which we are prepared to contest, by the way.

323
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:48,610
- There's a--- But in fairness

324
00:15:48,780 --> 00:15:49,780
and sensitivity,

325
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:54,170
we are prepared to make an offer.

326
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,690
Contingent on the results of DNA tests

327
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,680
and in signing a non-disclosure agreement,

328
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:00,290
each of you

329
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,270
will receive $1 million.

330
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:05,110
I hope you enjoy my cake,

331
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:08,110
after you provide your saliva, of course.

332
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:11,360
I grew up dirt poor knowing Eugene Monreaux was my father.

333
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,870
Y'all built this place

334
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,120
on the back of a secret I kept for you.

335
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,860
I'm not walking away for a million bucks.

336
00:16:19,030 --> 00:16:21,790
You're valued at 2.2 billion.

337
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:22,980
And you flew us coach?

338
00:16:23,140 --> 00:16:25,650
I'm gonna need to talk this over with my brothers

339
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:26,960
and we'll get back to you.

340
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,160
You take all the time you need,

341
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,370
but for the financial wellbeing

342
00:16:30,540 --> 00:16:33,040
of the company, your discretion is required.

343
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:34,900
We wouldn't want anyone finding this out

344
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:36,660
and nor should you.

345
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,810
Well, that's all for now.

346
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,640
Please spit.

347
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:44,910
In my line of work,

348
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,650
I've learned that a desperate person

349
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,580
will pay anything.

350
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:55,400
Thank you for the lovely cake, Mrs. Monreaux.

351
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:57,420
Oh, you're welcome.

352
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:03,830
Maybe we should have some sort

353
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,850
of relationship with them.

354
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:07,250
I mean, I don't know, if Dad thought

355
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,360
- putting them in the--- Can it, Rose.

356
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:12,420
How'd that go?

357
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,770
How'd what go?

358
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:16,530
You told Becky.

359
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,920
She's my wife, Mom.

360
00:17:19,090 --> 00:17:19,920
Yeah.

361
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:21,930
We have bigger fish to fry.

362
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,940
The network is falling apart.

363
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,020
The business of the network

364
00:17:25,190 --> 00:17:27,430
is none of your concern, Preacher.

365
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,930
You are the talent.

366
00:17:29,030 --> 00:17:30,710
Well, thank you, Franklin, for acknowledging that.

367
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,550
So here's the plan.

368
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:34,880
You need to get back on air.

369
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:37,960
you and me.

370
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:40,040
Without you, I suffer.

371
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,610
No one should be made to suffer.

372
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:46,380
So you make Eric the CEO.

373
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,880
I will serve in official advisory capacity

374
00:17:49,050 --> 00:17:50,810
just as Eugene wanted,

375
00:17:50,970 --> 00:17:52,900
and you go back to doing what you do best:

376
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:55,640
recipes and advice.

377
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:01,150
Eric, should we grab that lunch?

378
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:15,810
Margaret really hooked us up.

379
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:17,000
Yeah.

380
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,000
Place has been energized with fresh faces

381
00:18:19,170 --> 00:18:21,340
since the patriarch passed.

382
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,650
Excuse me?

383
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,410
Luke Taylor, Daily Edge.

384
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:26,430
Reporter?

385
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:27,580
Well, my mother prefers

386
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:28,920
investigative journalist.

387
00:18:29,010 --> 00:18:31,420
Rolls off the tongue nice, right?

388
00:18:31,590 --> 00:18:33,090
You mind if I ask what business you had today

389
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,350
at Monreaux Unlimited?

390
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,930
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

391
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,430
No press allowed.

392
00:18:41,770 --> 00:18:43,360
You should call me.

393
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:58,800
Dude, they're loaded. What are you talking about?

394
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:02,140
I could train full time and have child care for Jesus.

395
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:06,290
Man, Eugene knew about you and he let you struggle.

396
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:09,030
Look, all I know is one minute I'm broke,

397
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,810
sweating my ass off in Queens,

398
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,870
and the next minute some white lady

399
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,800
is offering me a very delicious piece of cake

400
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:16,130
and a million bucks.

401
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,230
I'm good with both those things.

402
00:19:18,390 --> 00:19:20,880
And I bet this is the first time in your life

403
00:19:21,050 --> 00:19:22,060
that you've got real power.

404
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,900
Not strength or muscle, but power.

405
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,400
- Don't you see that? - Listen.

406
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:27,570
I'm taking the money.

407
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,400
Antonio, I'm asking you to fight.

408
00:19:29,570 --> 00:19:31,240
When was the last time people like us came out on top?

409
00:19:31,330 --> 00:19:33,170
People like what?

410
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,240
Is that what you're gonna teach your son?

411
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,340
What about those DNA tests?

412
00:19:40,540 --> 00:19:43,660
Positive, except Jason's sample was contaminated.

413
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,140
He's retaking his.

414
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:52,190
I am so proud of you.

415
00:19:56,930 --> 00:19:59,080
Live from the Sunshine Studios

416
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:02,590
in beautiful New Orleans, ladies and gentlemen,

417
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,850
once again, Margaret Monreaux.

418
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,950
Thank you.

419
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:19,210
Thank you all so much for that warm welcome home.

420
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:21,880
One month ago,

421
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:25,550
I lost my beloved husband and best friend.

422
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,960
I miss him greatly, and truthfully,

423
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,630
I didn't know if I could go on.

424
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:36,560
Then I thought of one of Eugene's favorite verses.

425
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:38,640
"Be watchful.

426
00:20:38,810 --> 00:20:40,880
"Stand firm in your faith.

427
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:42,900
Act like men. Be strong."

428
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,960
Because of Eugene,

429
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:48,560
because of your faith in our mission,

430
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,530
I'm back here today...

431
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:55,080
Because we have work to do in our great country.

432
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,810
People like us, people of faith,

433
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,920
we are under constant attack,

434
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,480
and now more than ever,

435
00:21:01,650 --> 00:21:07,410
I realize we must all stay close to our families

436
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:10,010
and keep them safe.

437
00:21:11,250 --> 00:21:12,840
That's what Eugene would have wanted,

438
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:14,840
both at home

439
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:18,000
and right here with the family we have in this room.

440
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:20,940
Always together makes a family forever.

441
00:21:22,430 --> 00:21:24,940
And family is the most valuable thing in the world.

442
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,280
And that's why we're not walking away

443
00:21:29,450 --> 00:21:30,660
for a million bucks.

444
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:38,030
All of the other kids have refused our offer.

445
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,700
It's Ginger.

446
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:40,780
Can you blame them for wanting

447
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:43,020
a proper seat at the table?

448
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:44,610
You sound like you're on her side.

449
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,130
I'm on my side, Margaret.

450
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,040
I love you but I got a lot to lose

451
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,120
- if this company goes belly up. - I know that.

452
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,550
I got the place in Pebble Beach.

453
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,050
You got the loft in SoHo.

454
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,970
Now, you know I like my real estate, Margaret.

455
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,700
I said I know.

456
00:21:56,870 --> 00:21:58,550
Just saying,

457
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:02,630
taking a moment to look at it from her side, okay?

458
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:06,470
That will keep us from being helpless in the negotiation.

459
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:08,640
The only time a Monreaux girl is helpless

460
00:22:08,810 --> 00:22:10,470
is when her nails are drying.

461
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,490
If Ginger wants a proper seat at the table,

462
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:15,160
let's give her one.

463
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:17,310
I think a ladies luncheon would be of great benefit

464
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,660
to Miss Sweet.

465
00:22:18,830 --> 00:22:20,820
Oh, Madge, darling,

466
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:22,150
- you just look wonderful. - Oh.

467
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:26,820
They were Eugene's favorite.

468
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:28,730
Oh, dear. Who is that?

469
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,180
An acquaintance. Excuse me.

470
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:34,680
Of course.

471
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,430
Margaret, darling.

472
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:46,030
Thank you for the invitation.

473
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:47,420
You should feel stupid right now,

474
00:22:47,590 --> 00:22:48,680
'cause I certainly don't.

475
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,420
Why, you wore my color.

476
00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:00,930
Where did you get that outfit on such short notice?

477
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:04,540
- A friend sent it overnight. - I love it.

478
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:05,860
Well, I love what you're wearing.

479
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,790
- You make that, too? - Uh-huh.

480
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,050
I have a whole line planned,

481
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,440
but somehow I'm not gaining any traction on it.

482
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:12,970
Excuse me.

483
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:16,450
Good afternoon, ladies,

484
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,450
and welcome to our annual ladies luncheon.

485
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:21,950
This year our focus is

486
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,230
on the city's mentoring program for girls,

487
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,730
or as we prefer to call them,

488
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:28,380
businesswomen of the future.

489
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:31,050
It's been a sad time at the network,

490
00:23:31,220 --> 00:23:33,800
so although I previously agreed to speak today,

491
00:23:33,970 --> 00:23:35,560
I hope you'll understand and forgive me

492
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:38,150
if I do not, but in my place,

493
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,750
I'd like to introduce a woman with a successful company

494
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,420
that she built from the ground up.

495
00:23:44,590 --> 00:23:48,420
The lovely lady in that charming hoop skirt,

496
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:50,260
Miss Ginger Sweet.

497
00:23:52,590 --> 00:23:53,930
Come on up here, Ginger!

498
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,420
Let's welcome Ginger.

499
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:08,850
Why don't you start by telling these young ladies

500
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,520
what you do for a living, sweetie.

501
00:24:10,690 --> 00:24:12,110
Inspire them.

502
00:24:12,280 --> 00:24:14,570
I know how proud you are of what you do.

503
00:24:24,290 --> 00:24:28,440
Well, it seems that Miss Sweet has a bit of stage fright.

504
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:29,870
We've all been there.

505
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:31,950
Why don't we bring up our next speaker

506
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,630
and, uh, we'll get this all sorted out?

507
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,950
Come on over here, sweetie.

508
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,030
There's no place for you in civil society.

509
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,550
I'm offering you two million now,

510
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,810
which we feel is quite generous,

511
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,870
considering you represent no more than ten minutes

512
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:47,460
of my husband's pleasure.

513
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:51,470
You take the money and go home.

514
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,820
Nothing makes me happier than cooking for my boy.

515
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,310
- Thanks for coming over. - Aw. Wow.

516
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,480
No, no, no. None for me.

517
00:25:04,650 --> 00:25:05,560
Becky and I are off sugar.

518
00:25:05,730 --> 00:25:08,580
It's 100% pure unfiltered maple.

519
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:10,150
It's good for you.

520
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,510
It's full of magnesium and zinc and--

521
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:13,670
All right, all right.

522
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,090
Why am I here?

523
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:21,910
Well, I've thought about it and I've prayed on it,

524
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:24,180
and I don't think you're ready

525
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:26,310
to take your father's place in the company.

526
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,930
Now, the world is watching and we need

527
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,690
to take things very slowly for a beat.

528
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,340
Slow? No, why slow?

529
00:25:35,510 --> 00:25:36,510
The company needs to take action

530
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,860
to preserve its future now.

531
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:43,290
Son, this may not feel like a loving statement but...

532
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:48,080
You lack polish.

533
00:25:56,130 --> 00:25:58,200
Maple syrup is still sugar, Mama.

534
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,450
You can dress it up all you like.

535
00:26:01,610 --> 00:26:03,390
It's still gonna kill you.

536
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,790
Dad told the Reverend he wanted me to take over.

537
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,770
Why are you denying me?

538
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:12,960
What, doesn't Dad get a say in any of this,

539
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,460
or have you already forgotten him?

540
00:26:19,150 --> 00:26:21,320
Come on in, Franklin. Mom's serving up sugar.

541
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:30,160
Rumors starting to fly about our hotel guests.

542
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:32,540
Might be best to keep them out of public view.

543
00:26:34,330 --> 00:26:35,750
We'll bring them out to the camp.

544
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:38,510
Let everybody simmer down for a bit.

545
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:42,580
It's time to replace Eugene.

546
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,430
For the sake of the family.

547
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:54,350
Earl.

548
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:58,520
This is for you, baby.

549
00:26:58,690 --> 00:26:59,850
Eric!

550
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,610
NEWSCASTER: For more on this developing story,

551
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:03,020
we take you live to the company's headquarters

552
00:27:03,190 --> 00:27:04,450
- at downtown New Orleans... - You all right?

553
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:06,690
NEWSCASTER: Where a news conference is happening now.

554
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:09,350
I would like to assure our audience

555
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,440
and our shareholders that we are far

556
00:27:11,610 --> 00:27:13,110
from a rudderless ship.

557
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:15,700
Monreaux Unlimited will remain in the family

558
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:18,360
in trusted, responsible hands.

559
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:19,800
Effective immediately,

560
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:21,970
the new CEO for Monreaux Unlimited

561
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:26,700
will be Margaret Monreaux.

562
00:27:26,870 --> 00:27:28,310
MARGARET: Thank you.

563
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,550
Thank you all so much.

564
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,220
Your mom's a bitch.

565
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:35,560
MARGARET: I take this responsibility seriously.

566
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,650
- Two million? - Wow.

567
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:39,570
- Well done. - I'm not taking it.

568
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:43,550
Why?

569
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,990
I can see a loss when it's coming.

570
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:46,980
We're worth more.

571
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,740
All of us are worth more. They're trying to erase us.

572
00:27:49,940 --> 00:27:52,670
If I'm gonna be erased, it's gonna cost her.

573
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:53,910
Good morning.

574
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,330
Mrs. Monreaux has invited you all

575
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:56,580
to stay at her hunting camp.

576
00:27:56,750 --> 00:27:57,820
So she can shoot us?

577
00:27:57,990 --> 00:28:00,160
Yo, yo, look.

578
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:02,900
You can stay here if you want, but I'm going.

579
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,420
Me, too. I'm not worth more.

580
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:13,190
I can't believe my own mother

581
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:15,250
would take a job from right underneath me!

582
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:17,010
- I went to Wharton! - You about flunked out.

583
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,630
You think the Reverend's gonna be reassured

584
00:28:18,690 --> 00:28:19,600
with you at the helm?

585
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:20,750
You watch that tongue, young man.

586
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:21,860
I created the network,

587
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,510
I have the most-watched lifestyle show on TV,

588
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:25,610
and I am your mother.

589
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:28,020
I will not tolerate disrespect.

590
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:29,110
Hey, Eric.

591
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,760
Our sister and brothers are here.

592
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:33,610
They're staying with us.

593
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,600
You have lost your damn mind!

594
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:57,060
Welcome to the camp.

595
00:28:57,230 --> 00:28:59,060
Make yourselves at home. Take your shoes off.

596
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:00,970
Oh, these are my Tuesday socks,

597
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:02,570
and it's Friday. Are you sure?

598
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,960
You got a point.

599
00:29:04,130 --> 00:29:05,650
I'll take my hat off, then.

600
00:29:05,810 --> 00:29:07,970
Antonio, I got you a babysitter.

601
00:29:08,130 --> 00:29:09,650
Pick a room upstairs. Any room.

602
00:29:09,820 --> 00:29:10,800
Any room? Ah, thank you.

603
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:11,800
Hey, let me show you around.

604
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:13,080
- Okay. - Come on, okay.

605
00:29:13,250 --> 00:29:15,310
So, this is our, like, main...

606
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,980
About lunch. What I did was wrong.

607
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,740
We're both strong-willed women working through our emotions,

608
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:24,000
and I'd like it if we could start over.

609
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:26,000
You really think I'm stupid, don't you?

610
00:29:26,170 --> 00:29:29,000
No, definitely not, Ginger.

611
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,820
I've learned never to underestimate

612
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,660
Eugene's progeny.

613
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,340
Pick a room, Ginger.

614
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:36,750
I'm cooking you all

615
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,600
a traditional Cajun dinner tonight.

616
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:44,650
I know you probably have some hard feelings towards Dad...

617
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:50,190
But I think if you'd known him, you would have liked him.

618
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:52,620
- I don't know about that. - Hmm.

619
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,940
He was, like, the only person

620
00:29:55,110 --> 00:29:57,660
who believed in what I'm trying to do.

621
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,690
You mind if I smoke some weed?

622
00:30:02,780 --> 00:30:04,510
Just calms the nerves.

623
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,550
What do you have to be nervous about?

624
00:30:11,470 --> 00:30:12,810
I'm kidding.

625
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:16,530
This entire situation would turn anybody into a pot head.

626
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:19,720
Never change, yeah, just always the same

627
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:23,170
Whatever ya need

628
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:26,930
And all you gotta do is call

629
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,490
I can't believe I did that.

630
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:34,980
I'd like to clear the air and apologize to you three

631
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,980
for how I've conducted myself

632
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:39,830
After much prayer and reflection,

633
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:44,410
I've decided to give each of you 1%

634
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,820
of the company.

635
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:47,900
It is what Eugene wanted.

636
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:51,590
All I ask is that you sign NDAs

637
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,000
protecting the reputation

638
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,740
of the company and our interests in it.

639
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,590
1% comes out to 6 million.

640
00:30:58,850 --> 00:31:00,410
- Thank you. - No.

641
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:03,840
Uh, Ginger, you do realize that she's being really,

642
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:05,520
really nice to us right now?

643
00:31:05,750 --> 00:31:06,690
Thank you, Antonio.

644
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,600
Personally, I wanna say

645
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,750
I will take your offer and go home

646
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:13,610
and none of you have to see me ever,

647
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,020
ever again. I totally promise.

648
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:17,760
Given there are five of us

649
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,930
including Eric and Rose,

650
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,280
I think 5% is a better number.

651
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,780
$30 million?

652
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,100
And biblically speaking,

653
00:31:27,270 --> 00:31:29,860
the number five symbolizes God's grace,

654
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:33,030
goodness, and favor toward humans.

655
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,780
It's mentioned 318 times in scripture.

656
00:31:36,870 --> 00:31:41,300
The ten commandments contain two sets of five commandments.

657
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:44,710
The first five commandments are related to our treatment

658
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,970
and relationship with God,

659
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,050
and the last five commandments

660
00:31:49,220 --> 00:31:50,740
concern our relationship with others,

661
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,890
like me, Antonio, Jason, Eric, and Rose.

662
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,910
What do you think, Rose?

663
00:31:58,410 --> 00:32:01,080
Is $30 million enough to ghost this joint

664
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:03,210
and start your own fashion house?

665
00:32:04,810 --> 00:32:06,660
Yep.

666
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,820
You are a goddess.

667
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:16,010
Just a complete and total goddess.

668
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:19,100
I wish I was more like you.

669
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,100
You're more like me than you know.

670
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,850
I see you.

671
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:30,780
I see a girl who spent her whole life

672
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:33,000
making sure her mom was okay

673
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:37,070
before she even thought to have a thought for herself.

674
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,540
Tell me about your mom, Ginger.

675
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:48,420
Can you just keep telling me how awesome I am?

676
00:32:49,610 --> 00:32:50,630
No prob.

677
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,640
Despite what you may think,

678
00:32:59,810 --> 00:33:01,810
your father cared deeply about you.

679
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:04,030
You didn't know it, but he followed your business.

680
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,870
He didn't like it, but he couldn't help

681
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:09,020
but see a bit of himself in you.

682
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,320
He wrote this letter recently.

683
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:20,280
Said he wasn't getting any younger.

684
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:36,400
Dear Ginger,

685
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:40,900
I want you to know that I've thought of you every day.

686
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:43,830
I'm proud of who you are because you're not afraid

687
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,520
to be who you are.

688
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:49,170
I've always loved you.

689
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:52,190
I wish I'd been the father you deserved.

690
00:33:57,420 --> 00:33:59,440
Come on, church! Put your hands together!

691
00:33:59,610 --> 00:34:00,850
Hands together for the Lord!

692
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,020
Trying just to hold on

693
00:34:03,110 --> 00:34:05,780
While the ground keeps shaking

694
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:10,040
But I'm never gonna question who I place my faith in

695
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:12,190
No

696
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,770
No, no, no 'cause He rose

697
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:25,130
Yeah He rose

698
00:34:26,950 --> 00:34:28,560
Yeah He rose

699
00:34:28,730 --> 00:34:31,620
I love when he sings.

700
00:34:31,790 --> 00:34:32,640
Yeah.

701
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,440
Yeah

702
00:34:38,890 --> 00:34:41,910
'Cause he rose

703
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,890
Hands together for the Lord. He's alive forever.

704
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,910
For Tuesday's cooking segment,

705
00:34:46,140 --> 00:34:49,990
how about deep fried ham cheese basil sandwiches?

706
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:51,730
The spirit comes into a man's heart when he is in need,

707
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,980
and the Spirit says, "Lay it all unto me."

708
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,590
Brother Eric, unburden your heart.

709
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,070
Thank you, Reverend.

710
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,260
Um, yeah, my heart is, uh--my heart's heavy

711
00:35:02,490 --> 00:35:06,260
and full of grief for myself and my family,

712
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:09,100
uh, for I fear that we've lost our way.

713
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,990
Speak the truth, all right?

714
00:35:11,090 --> 00:35:14,110
- God's listening. - Unburden your heart, brother.

715
00:35:15,170 --> 00:35:17,500
So my father, Eugene,

716
00:35:17,670 --> 00:35:19,020
um, the man that--

717
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:23,930
that you all knew and loved...

718
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,680
Unbeknownst to us,

719
00:35:25,840 --> 00:35:26,860
he had three--

720
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:30,940
Matthew 26:15 asks,

721
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:32,850
"What are you willing to give me

722
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,940
if I deliver Him over to you?"

723
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,870
Now, there are a lot of businesses out there

724
00:35:38,040 --> 00:35:40,020
who take far more than they give

725
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:41,750
when it comes to deliveries.

726
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,800
They say vote with your dollar.

727
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,800
Well, I say pray with your dollar.

728
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,030
Reverend, can I have a word?

729
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,030
Hello, everybody.

730
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,310
Now, Sunny Club is an online fellowship...

731
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,650
I see what you're doing.

732
00:35:53,870 --> 00:35:55,130
You will lose. You hear me?

733
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:56,890
You put Eric in charge or the world hears the truth.

734
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,970
You were preaching inside a double-wide

735
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:01,040
when I found you. I created you.

736
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:03,820
- You don't scare me. - Well, maybe I should.

737
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:07,730
Can you hear me in Hong Kong? From Norway to LA?

738
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,890
Can you hear me in Australia?

739
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:12,060
The San Francisco Bay?

740
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,910
You'll be lucky if they can hear you

741
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,170
in Luling, Louisiana after this.

742
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:16,580
You're out of your depth, CEO.

743
00:36:16,750 --> 00:36:18,060
You get rid of me,

744
00:36:18,150 --> 00:36:19,670
you lose all your precious Sunny Club customers.

745
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:20,840
Who'll be left to buy your toilet paper

746
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:22,010
and your greeting cards?

747
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,990
You might even have to sell Butt Butter.

748
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:24,840
Simply sign up...

749
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:27,090
Excuse me. I have a show to do.

750
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,520
- Norah! - They're coming soon.

751
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,090
Today's sermon is Luke 8:17.

752
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,690
"For nothing is hidden that will not become evident

753
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,770
when come to light." Eric?

754
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:56,620
We all have secrets.

755
00:36:56,710 --> 00:36:57,880
Don't we?

756
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,610
- Hi. - Hey, baby doll.

757
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,960
Rachel and I were just thinking about how much we missed you.

758
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,800
- Hi. - How's it going down there?

759
00:37:08,890 --> 00:37:11,130
Well, you're not going to believe it,

760
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,890
but I am staying at their house in the country.

761
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:16,470
Of course you are.

762
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:18,880
- I bet it's huge. - Hey, I wanna talk to her.

763
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:20,730
Honey, when are you gonna come back, huh?

764
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,070
Tina, give it. Let me talk to her.

765
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:25,130
All right, Rachel wants to say something to you.

766
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:26,980
Hey, did you not get my text?

767
00:37:27,070 --> 00:37:29,070
Yeah, I just--I haven't had time to--

768
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,630
Big Sally poached Sheila and Kitty.

769
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,910
I have been at the mall recruiting

770
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:33,970
for, like, four straight days.

771
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,990
Hmm? Yeah, I'm listening.

772
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,640
Okay, let's just talk about it later.

773
00:37:37,810 --> 00:37:38,730
Obviously, you're busy there.

774
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:40,640
I'm sorry, Rach.

775
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,660
Yeah. You're fine.

776
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:45,330
It's just that -- don't tell Mom--

777
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:48,080
but...

778
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,000
I'm starting to like these people.

779
00:37:50,170 --> 00:37:55,580
Eugene wrote me a letter.

780
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,930
I have a question about my father.

781
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,620
Hello, honey. I didn't see you there.

782
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:18,200
I'm a lefty.

783
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:19,770
My mom told me that I got that from Eugene.

784
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,870
Is that true?

785
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,610
Is everything all right, sweetie?

786
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:26,360
A right-handed person wrote this.

787
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,260
Eugene didn't feel this way about me, did he?

788
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,430
Did you fake this?

789
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:38,310
What kind of person does that?

790
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,190
I...

791
00:38:43,730 --> 00:38:45,820
Uh, I don't know what to say.

792
00:38:46,030 --> 00:38:48,280
I don't want your money.

793
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,310
Or your disgusting family.

794
00:38:51,470 --> 00:38:53,140
You know, maybe someday

795
00:38:53,310 --> 00:38:54,980
you'll be as good as you think you are,

796
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,440
and just so you know,

797
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:02,170
Eugene spent more than ten minutes with my mother.

798
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:06,400
They were together for a year.

799
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,510
Jason and I are taking the deal.

800
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:29,010
Fine. Take their money.

801
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:32,440
Make sure you get it while they still have it.

802
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:34,440
Don't mess this up for me.

803
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:46,120
I am struggling, Lord.

804
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:51,370
I am struggling to understand your will for me.

805
00:39:51,530 --> 00:39:53,790
Show me the way.

806
00:39:53,890 --> 00:39:55,700
I will follow.

807
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:07,310
I'm so sorry. He--he got away from me.

808
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:14,300
Um, Miss Monreaux, I, uh--I just wanted to say thanks.

809
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:16,060
For everything.

810
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:18,480
You're gonna change my little boy's life.

811
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:23,310
Have you thought about education?

812
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:26,250
You--you have to get on that right now.

813
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:29,240
There are some amazing schools in New Orleans.

814
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,570
You should discuss it with his mother.

815
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:34,300
She's not really in the picture.

816
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,260
Miss Monreaux,

817
00:40:39,430 --> 00:40:41,420
I wanted you to know that Ginger's been talking

818
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,340
to the press.

819
00:40:51,170 --> 00:40:52,090
Did you get my message?

820
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:53,170
Are they ready for me?

821
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:55,100
Yes, full house, but we got a problem.

822
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,450
What's the issue? I gave you the exclusive.

823
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,690
We had a deal.

824
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:02,350
Yeah, but my boss just made a different one.

825
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,600
Ginger, don't go!

826
00:41:03,770 --> 00:41:05,200
Ladies and gentlemen,

827
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:08,690
I thank you for coming together on such short notice.

828
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:10,800
In the past few days,

829
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:12,610
it has become abundantly clear

830
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,450
that I cannot do this job alone.

831
00:41:15,540 --> 00:41:17,530
Congratulations, CEO.

832
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:21,920
Now with the passing of Eugene,

833
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:26,220
we lost our CEO, I lost my husband,

834
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:30,650
and Rose and Eric lost their father.

835
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,490
But we have gained as well.

836
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:35,210
Unbeknownst to us,

837
00:41:35,380 --> 00:41:38,730
Eugene had fathered three other children.

838
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,830
And they're here with us today.

839
00:41:42,050 --> 00:41:45,480
God, he sees all,

840
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:47,170
and he forgives all.

841
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:49,560
Eugene.

842
00:41:49,730 --> 00:41:51,580
We all know that he had his demons.

843
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,860
We all do, and so I forgive him.

844
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:58,580
And Reverend Thomas, he forgives him.

845
00:41:58,800 --> 00:42:00,850
Oh, now that's true Christianity.

846
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:03,240
Judge not lest ye be judged.

847
00:42:03,410 --> 00:42:04,680
That's what the Reverend told me,

848
00:42:04,850 --> 00:42:06,410
and he got us through this.

849
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,240
Thank you, Paul.

850
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:11,190
God decides who comes into your life,

851
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:14,690
but your heart must decide who stays,

852
00:42:14,860 --> 00:42:16,840
so with the Lord's guidance,

853
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:20,760
I welcome Antonio Rivera, Jason Conley,

854
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:22,850
and Ginger Sweet to ours.

855
00:42:25,760 --> 00:42:28,520
Hey, Jason, where--where you going?

856
00:42:28,690 --> 00:42:30,430
He's a camera-shy cutie.

857
00:42:30,600 --> 00:42:32,770
Ginger, get on up here.

858
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:34,420
I know you're not shy.

859
00:42:40,630 --> 00:42:42,050
Did you really think you'd have

860
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,610
the upper hand with the press in my town?

861
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,380
What in Heaven's name is that?

862
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:54,470
That's my mother.

863
00:43:21,580 --> 00:43:23,580
Is this Hell?

864
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:26,250
No, Louisiana.

865
00:43:37,780 --> 00:43:39,500
Gold coin

866
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:41,760
Stacks on stacks

867
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:42,840
Make 'em write that check

868
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:45,450
I want hard cash

869
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:46,950
Greenback

870
00:43:49,110 --> 00:43:50,680
Oh, that's a fact

871
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:52,700
I got the right class

872
00:43:52,870 --> 00:43:55,030
Yo, what's her weight

873
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:56,960
Rubies, rubies, yin and yang

874
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:58,870
Pounds on pounds in Swiss banks

875
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:00,970
That's the language that I speak

876
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:02,780
Now I lay me down to sleep

877
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:04,220
Amen
