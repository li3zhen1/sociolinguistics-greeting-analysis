1
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:03,650
Dear Lord, I know I prayed to go to camp as a little girl,

2
00:00:03,710 --> 00:00:05,720
but I did not mean Camp Monreaux.

3
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,890
Townes, Don, and Governor Virgil Love himself

4
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:09,340
want to buy Margaret out of SunnyClub.

5
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:11,320
You best prepare for a hostile takeover.

6
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,250
BECKY: After all, this is a man's business,

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:15,080
and all the hummingbird cake in the world can't make up

8
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:17,420
for the fact that she's a woman.

9
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:18,850
It's too bad they're only interested in grooming

10
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,410
my Eric for office.

11
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:21,850
My lieutenant governor just got indicted.

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,520
I'll be looking for another one.

13
00:00:23,690 --> 00:00:25,500
BECKY: Veronica Dockerty seems to have taken

14
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,350
a real interest in Jason.

15
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:29,360
Goodness, she's old enough to be his mother.

16
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:31,170
There's something off about that guy.

17
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,840
Dude, that's Mark.

18
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:35,010
BECKY: Call me crazy, but the whole thing

19
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,530
seemed to really annoy Rose.

20
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:38,700
Rose and Ginger have been acting funny anyway,

21
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:41,110
and so has Ginger's boozy mother Tina.

22
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:43,190
Ginger, we have to go.

23
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,760
She's got secrets. I know it.

24
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:46,600
BECKY: Same goes for Antonio's mother.

25
00:00:46,660 --> 00:00:47,950
Yopi Candalaria?

26
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,120
Long time no see, Don.

27
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:50,950
Do it!

28
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:53,550
BECKY: It turns out Tina and Ginger have been hiding

29
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,610
in Rose's closet the whole time.

30
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,940
Margaret wants to make some sort of, like, united front.

31
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:00,450
If these men won't give us a seat at their table,

32
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:01,720
then we'll create our own.

33
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:03,630
A ladies' table.

34
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,450
BECKY: But she doesn't have a humble bone in her body.

35
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,290
It hasn't been long since his death,

36
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:08,880
but Eugene's spirit fills this house.

37
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,640
It's palpable.

38
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:12,810
I keep expecting your daddy to walk out of that cane

39
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,570
with a stringer full of ducks.

40
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:16,390
BECKY: It feels like he could show up at any moment,

41
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,570
and things would be back to the way they were.

42
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:21,280
In Jesus's name. Amen.

43
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:25,150
TINA: It was Eugene.

44
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:29,420
I knew before I saw him.

45
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:31,980
I believe you saw what you saw, Tina.

46
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,660
But had you been drinking?

47
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,980
When I told Ginger, all she said was,

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,410
"This is why we're getting you help, Mom."

49
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,910
That house is full of ghosts.

50
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,650
And the souls of the people that worked that land

51
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:44,320
and walked those halls are still there.

52
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:47,660
I'm not surprised that Eugene has joined them.

53
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,830
But the Eugene you knew is gone.

54
00:01:50,890 --> 00:01:54,610
FRANKLIN: Margaret and I are here for you.

55
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,170
Okay, they're going to help you, Mom.

56
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:00,340
And if they don't, I'll burn the place down

57
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,760
and kill their firstborn.

58
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,340
Just do what they ask, okay?

59
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,440
I'll call you every day, and I'll keep you posted.

60
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,600
They took my phone.

61
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,960
Right.

62
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:14,190
I never gone a day without talking to you.

63
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,300
Be strong for me, and I'll be strong for you.

64
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:19,190
I love you.

65
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:27,530
Okay, okay.

66
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,480
Now go kick some ass.

67
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:34,220
Ready?

68
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,730
I guess Margaret will expect a thank you

69
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,880
for footing the bill.

70
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:45,720
She had a mother, too, you know.

71
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,570
Your mama's lucky to have you,

72
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,220
though it must be a burden from time to time

73
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:53,320
to have to be her caretaker.

74
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,740
"Caretaker"?

75
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:02,080
I'm her damn avenger, and hell hath no fury.

76
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,090
MARGARET: Sa Fe Lontah!

77
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:14,940
Mardi Gras is here.

78
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,690
Now when we come back,

79
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:22,340
I'm gonna show you how to make a roux

80
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,700
with my mama's skillet and her old wooden spoon,

81
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:27,430
so don't go anywhere.

82
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:29,690
And we're out. 60 seconds.

83
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:31,540
If I never eat another beignet,

84
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:33,110
it will be too soon.

85
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:34,930
Traditions are important, sweetie.

86
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,620
What if this year for Mardi Gras,

87
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,550
I went down to Bourbon Street for a pub crawl,

88
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,100
stripped off all my clothes,

89
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,120
and ran drunk, naked, like everyone else?

90
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,790
No daughter of mine would be caught dead doing that.

91
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,450
- Margaret? - What are you doing here?

92
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:49,130
Just checking in before I head out.

93
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:51,450
We're fine.

94
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:52,540
Will you give her my love?

95
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,150
Will do.

96
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:59,140
Franklin's day?

97
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,720
Every Mardi Gras.

98
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,480
The one day of the year he's not to be disturbed.

99
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:06,150
PRODUCER: I'm ready for you, Margaret.

100
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,560
MARGARET: I need levels.

101
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,970
VIRGIL: I believe in our flag...

102
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,230
- Oh, Mama. - I believe

103
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,320
in our state,

104
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:12,910
and I believe in our Lord.

105
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:17,400
A vote for Love will keep Louisiana in God's good grace.

106
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:20,500
A vote for Love will keep Louisiana great.

107
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:21,920
Eric.

108
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,680
VIRGIL: Like my mama always said...

109
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,420
Oh, he's getting pulled into their web.

110
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,670
ALL: Love always wins.

111
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,080
MARGARET: Governor Love is a pig.

112
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,740
I want that faithless hack away from my son

113
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:29,930
and off of my network.

114
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,910
Good luck. The sponsors are already

115
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:33,920
all in on getting him reelected.

116
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,680
Well, we'll make sure he's not.

117
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:37,160
- Hi, Margaret! - Hey!

118
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:40,610
Mama, hadn't Ginger told you about the tape?

119
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:42,680
What tape?

120
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:44,340
Oh, never mind.

121
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:47,170
I just thought with the whole ladies' table...

122
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,360
- And we're back in ten. - Rose.

123
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:49,770
Ginger has a cam tape

124
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,450
of the governor doing sacrilegious things

125
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,530
with Mardi Gras beads.

126
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,680
Sacrilegious, how?

127
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:55,350
Puts them in his...

128
00:04:55,450 --> 00:04:58,700
NORAH: Two, and we're live.

129
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,440
Welcome back!

130
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,280
You know, I was just sharing with our ladies here

131
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,210
that the best thing about Mardi Gras--

132
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,620
it's all those surprises.

133
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:11,840
Dear Lord, Mardi Gras is for pagans and whores,

134
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:14,720
and I'm walking this lonely road alone.

135
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:17,130
EUGENE: Keep walking.

136
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:19,220
Your path will find you.

137
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:21,480
You just keep walking, Eugene.

138
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:25,300
BECKY: Please, forgive me, Lord, but I'm kind of bored.

139
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,150
I hate to sound ungrateful,

140
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:30,400
but if someone were to invite me to a rave in Gomorrah,

141
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:35,480
these days, I'm not so sure I'd say no.

142
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,310
AUGIE: Hey, yo, Rocky Raccoon,

143
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:39,920
you wouldn't know the way to Nawlins, would you?

144
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:42,740
Yes.

145
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,080
BECKY: I'm fighting my dark side,

146
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:47,080
so please, make a miracle, Lord.

147
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,660
Make a miracle.

148
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,510
In Jesus's name, we pray.

149
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,800
Amen.

150
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,850
Boys, I've got an itch that the Lord

151
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,850
put me in this car for a reason.

152
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:01,080
Okay, this has gone weirdo.

153
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:04,580
You spell out your business, I can help you.

154
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:05,930
You know this family--

155
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:08,950
- Don't, TK, don't. - The Monreauxs?

156
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,440
I do.

157
00:06:12,530 --> 00:06:15,590
Well, they got a snake in the garden,

158
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:17,040
and his name is Mark.

159
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,050
Maybe I ask Don Bouchard to give Jesus

160
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,200
the damn fight, right?

161
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,130
I ride you because I want the world for you.

162
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,920
You know that, right?

163
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:44,310
Antonio, what are you doing here?

164
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,900
He lives here, with me.

165
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:48,790
Margaret, I'm so sorry, but you shouldn't have come.

166
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,720
I'm sorry. I don't remember

167
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,220
being formally introduced.

168
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:54,630
Yolanda Rivera Candalaria.

169
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:55,970
A lot of people call me Yopi,

170
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:58,290
but you can call me Mrs. Candalaria.

171
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:00,320
Pleasure.

172
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:02,730
Antonio, if you and Jesus are here,

173
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,080
what are you doing with your allowance?

174
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,660
That's none of your damn business.

175
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,310
Ma, Ma, Ma.

176
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,500
Please, don't fight.

177
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,330
I have no interest in fighting.

178
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,070
My business is with Ginger.

179
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,600
Ginge, armor up.

180
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:24,510
MARGARET: Ginger.

181
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:25,940
I'm not giving you that tape.

182
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,110
- Tape? - Rose told me she told you.

183
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,680
And I thought we were all working together

184
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,590
- to take these men down. - We are.

185
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:33,760
We'll take every last one of them down,

186
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,520
but not by hurting more women.

187
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,620
- Your mama-- she is safe.

188
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:40,270
Not Mom. My girls.

189
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,010
If that tape goes public,

190
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,610
there won't be a swinging John from here to Guam

191
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,290
that'll trust us.

192
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,520
It'll be the end of SaintWagon, which is exactly what you want.

193
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:50,960
What I really want is to make sure

194
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,860
that my son is out of harm's way.

195
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,540
What's Eric got to do with it?

196
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,450
Eric has joined Virgil's political campaign.

197
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,810
Unlike us, he doesn't know

198
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,550
what kind of a man Virgil really is.

199
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:04,130
Well, a tape's not gonna change his mind.

200
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:08,060
No, that tape's "break glass in case of emergency" only.

201
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:11,710
Virgil Love is one of the most faithless men

202
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:13,490
to ever have a seat in power,

203
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,970
and my Eric-- he is a good man.

204
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:19,380
He is.

205
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:22,330
Your friend here seems to get it.

206
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,310
Did you ever stop to think that there is a woman

207
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:27,000
on that tape as well as a man,

208
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:30,730
who might not want her identity splashed all over TV?

209
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:33,320
Now, you and I are gonna burn the house down.

210
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,420
However, I just put my mother in rehab

211
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:38,160
because men took advantage of her.

212
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:42,500
I'm not doing the same thing to someone else.

213
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:45,180
So we're watching this Wings of a Dove thing, right,

214
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,740
'cause this hot cam chick

215
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,170
that TK calls his "nighttime wife" was on,

216
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,930
and this Margaret lady

217
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,430
starts talking about how her dead billionaire husband

218
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:55,680
left all this money to these illegitimate kids

219
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:56,940
he had all over the country--

220
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,850
Dude was dropping seed like rain.

221
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,370
Who do you think we see standing

222
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,700
next to the Margaret lady?

223
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,190
It's our buddy Mark, man.

224
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,520
Mark's pretending to be our other buddy,

225
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,760
his brother Jason.

226
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:07,210
- Why? - It's a sad story.

227
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,540
Real Jason's in a coma back in Colorado.

228
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,100
It sucks on so many levels.

229
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,290
I mean, Mark's got this Margaret lady

230
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,720
thinking he's Jason.

231
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:17,870
Now Mark, he's, like, set to inherit billions

232
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,050
that the dead guy left for the real Jason,

233
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,450
who's a vegetable now.

234
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:23,060
That's sad. It's real sad.

235
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:25,710
And on top of that, Mark took our jobs with him.

236
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,540
I mean, what about us, bro? We don't have nothing.

237
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,730
So me and TK-- we're gonna blackmail Mark

238
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,050
for, like, lots of money, and if he doesn't pay us,

239
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:36,050
we'll spill the beans to screw him.

240
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:39,150
"For many deceivers have gone out into the world,

241
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:40,910
"those who do not confess

242
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:43,560
"the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh.

243
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:48,160
Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist."

244
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,400
Antichrist? Nah, he's just Mark, man.

245
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:54,050
Your plan is righteous.

246
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,510
I want to see his face.

247
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:08,920
Who knew sex wrapped up in a lie could be so hot?

248
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,510
Literally everyone.

249
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,360
Just answer it. Just answer it.

250
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,930
What?

251
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,360
Yo, we know what you're doing, man.

252
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,950
- Augie? - It's wrong, man,

253
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,290
pretending to be your brother, getting high on the hog

254
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,200
with those rich people while Jason is, like, wasting away.

255
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:34,790
500 Gs, man, or everybody knows you're a faker.

256
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:35,940
500 grand? Do you think

257
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,130
I have that kind of money?

258
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,280
Dude, that's extortion.

259
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:40,520
- Hi. - Who is this?

260
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,880
Listen, lady, here's the deal.

261
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,200
This guy you think is Jason owes us big.

262
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:46,030
And either he pays up,

263
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:47,290
or the whole world knows who he really is.

264
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,960
Okay, this is what's gonna happen.

265
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:50,980
You're gonna text us a drop-off location,

266
00:10:51,170 --> 00:10:52,650
we pay, and you go away.

267
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,150
I'm cool with that.

268
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,770
- Yeah, we'll text -  You text it now.

269
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,060
Talk about rude.

270
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,540
So God's really cool with all this?

271
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:02,880
Yes.

272
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,900
In an Old Testament kind of way.

273
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:08,480
Why did you agree to that?

274
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:11,810
Because I don't want to lose you.

275
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,390
Now come on. Put your shirt back on.

276
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,000
Really?

277
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,080
For me?

278
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:20,230
You've proven yourself, Eric.

279
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:21,730
You belong now.

280
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,840
This is a lot of bling for charity work.

281
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,920
The Lord rewards with abundance.

282
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,680
You know, I-I can't accept this.

283
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:30,000
Oh, no, you don't reject the Lord's bounty, Eric,

284
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,520
especially when it sparkles.

285
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:33,520
And there's a lot more coming, son.

286
00:11:33,670 --> 00:11:35,600
Believe me.

287
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:38,020
I'm overwhelmed and honored, but this is--

288
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,360
- No buts. It's gorgeous. - Mm-hmm.

289
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,250
Hey, Mama,

290
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:46,350
the, uh, governor gave me this for my work at the missions.

291
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,700
Well, isn't that

292
00:11:47,850 --> 00:11:49,690
an expensive bauble for missionary work?

293
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,280
Yeah.

294
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:53,110
Yeah. Ho, ho, ho!

295
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:56,950
- Look at this. - Wow.

296
00:11:57,050 --> 00:11:58,380
Holy-Look at that.

297
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:59,700
Thank you, Margaret.

298
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,620
Your scene shop helped us out with this.

299
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:03,880
There's enough room for the Love family,

300
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,780
the entire campaign team, and, Eric,

301
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,950
I think you should take the front bow.

302
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:09,870
- Yeah? - Yeah.

303
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:11,630
Look, we better get to the French Quarter.

304
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:13,890
Maggie, it's a pleasure as usual.

305
00:12:14,090 --> 00:12:16,620
Funny you should use the word "pleasure," Governor.

306
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:17,810
Excuse me?

307
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,810
I've heard said that Mardi Gras--

308
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,730
it can bring out the true nature in us,

309
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:26,720
one's latent desires, which could be used against us.

310
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,630
I believe the good people of Louisiana--

311
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:32,990
they deserve to be protected from any, uh, taped evidence

312
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:36,250
of a leader's sacrilegious depravity.

313
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:39,330
You can't talk that way to me.

314
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,980
Wait, what tape? Who...

315
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,500
who would tape Uncle Virgil?

316
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,910
It's your sister, sweetie. Ginger.

317
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:48,820
I think she's getting ready to use it.

318
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:52,340
SaintWagon taped its customers?

319
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,100
Virgil...

320
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:57,330
now, I don't want you or your family

321
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:00,270
to experience the media circus that Eugene put us through.

322
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,610
So for the good of everyone, I highly recommend

323
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:06,760
that you drop out of the governor's race,

324
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:10,200
and resign any involvement with the Sunshine Network.

325
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,080
Do I make myself clear?

326
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,030
You have fun, y'all.

327
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,350
- Mama. - And happy Mardi Gras.

328
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,950
You can control her?

329
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,120
Who's running this holy war?

330
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:33,370
If I go down, everybody goes down.

331
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,360
- Everybody goes down! - Hey, hey, let me talk to her,

332
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:37,190
all right? I'll talk some sense into her.

333
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:40,360
Yeah, talk some sense to her.

334
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,790
Mama, why would you do that to Uncle Virgil?

335
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:46,390
I know these men.

336
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:48,350
They do bad things. They hurt people.

337
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:51,470
You're a good Christian boy.

338
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,020
Stay that way.

339
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,290
Eric.

340
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:05,630
That tape is a boomerang.

341
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:06,980
If I take out the governor,

342
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,240
I'll take myself out at the same time.

343
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,580
It's not news. Not to me, at least.

344
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,820
What people do in the bedroom is their business.

345
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:14,400
What do I do? I don't want

346
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,820
Love to get away with what he did to my mother.

347
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,080
What did he do to Tina?

348
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,590
No, that's not my story to tell.

349
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,250
Your mother has a lot of information.

350
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,160
You should let me talk to her.

351
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,320
I don't think that's a good thing for her.

352
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,150
She's trying to get better,

353
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:29,580
and I don't want to make her relive all of that trauma,

354
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,670
not right now.

355
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,930
But maybe Margaret has a point.

356
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,270
Sex scandal does nothing to these guys.

357
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:38,920
Love will just go on an apology tour,

358
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,180
come back stronger than ever, but...

359
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:45,690
fraud, money laundering, and...

360
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,760
maybe even murder.

361
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:48,110
Murder?

362
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,170
What I show you stays here.

363
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:53,680
What the hell is this?

364
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,070
Why is my father up there?

365
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:03,540
Eugene was in the middle of all of this.

366
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,190
The reverend's friends, the 18:20--

367
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:09,620
They're into a whole host of nasty.

368
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,910
Land, tax fraud.

369
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:13,790
And I think it got Eugene killed.

370
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:14,870
Killed? It was

371
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,140
an accidental plane crash.

372
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:18,350
Maybe. Maybe not.

373
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:23,390
They collectively own 48% of Monreaux Unlimited.

374
00:15:23,530 --> 00:15:25,820
That's three points away from total control.

375
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:27,320
They want it all.

376
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,230
You think Margaret's in danger?

377
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,570
Hold onto the tape as your insurance policy.

378
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,810
You want to take these men down,

379
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:36,980
work with me to find the real story.

380
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,070
It ain't getting any easier not having you here,

381
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:51,590
not having your guidance.

382
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:57,590
Dragonflies flying low.

383
00:15:57,690 --> 00:16:01,170
The scent of the magnolias floating towards me.

384
00:16:01,190 --> 00:16:02,930
You calling Margaret and me inside

385
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,190
when the light was gone.

386
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:11,090
I just wish Margaret loved me back.

387
00:16:13,950 --> 00:16:16,740
I just wish I felt like any of them

388
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:18,600
knew how to love me back.

389
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,710
Miss you, Mama.

390
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,730
I can't believe you're gonna pay those idiots.

391
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:41,270
They're spineless and stupid.

392
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,470
Look, if we don't pay spineless and stupid,

393
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,050
they're gonna leak your identity,

394
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,710
and you got to jail, so, I mean, yeah,

395
00:16:46,820 --> 00:16:49,050
we pay them and just-- the world keeps spinning.

396
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,630
500K?

397
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,900
Oh, please. They're only getting 50.

398
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,830
You're so comfortable with this.

399
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:55,070
It's weird.

400
00:16:55,270 --> 00:16:57,300
Do you have any idea how many times

401
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,240
Eric and I were almost kidnapped as kids?

402
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:04,810
Hi, Franklin. So sorry to disturb you.

403
00:17:04,870 --> 00:17:06,230
This will only take a second.

404
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,000
We're not even here. I'll be right back.

405
00:17:26,130 --> 00:17:27,260
You're not here. Remember?

406
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,320
Okay.

407
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:36,200
Who even are you to these people, Franklin?

408
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,030
I could ask you the same thing.

409
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,770
No, I didn't mean it like that.

410
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:46,530
I just--I've never been around this much money before,

411
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:49,190
and...

412
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:52,610
I've never met people like any of you.

413
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:56,210
Not you. You seem cool and normal.

414
00:17:56,300 --> 00:18:00,210
But the Monreauxs, it's...

415
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,880
if they don't want to deal with people,

416
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:04,720
they just throw money at them to make them go away.

417
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:08,020
Oh, they try.

418
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:12,040
I'm so sorry, Franklin. We were never here.

419
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,990
Have patience, Eric. Your mother will come around.

420
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:24,050
A day with the Lord is like 1,000 years,

421
00:18:24,070 --> 00:18:25,980
and 1,000--

422
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,220
How did you get in here?

423
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,390
I headlined this venue, remember?

424
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,010
- Where's Margaret? - Okay, you have some nerve

425
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,570
showing your face in here.

426
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:39,750
Listen, I don't like you, but like your mother,

427
00:18:39,850 --> 00:18:41,180
I am worried about you,

428
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,330
the creepy company that you keep.

429
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:45,830
Oh, you're lecturing me, you hypocrite?

430
00:18:45,890 --> 00:18:48,910
Hypocrite?

431
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:50,100
What are you talking about?

432
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,520
Well, I thought you had a code of honor.

433
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,600
Or are you planning to blackmail

434
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,840
all your customers?

435
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,110
- How dare you? - Who let you in?

436
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:02,350
Norah, it's okay. Let her say her piece.

437
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:04,760
I told you I didn't want anyone to know.

438
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,350
- And you-Ginger, Ginger,

439
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:08,020
just calm down.

440
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,580
Why don't we discuss this in a civil manner?

441
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,300
Please?

442
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:17,120
You told Virgil Love I had a tape of him.

443
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,880
Well, you do have a tape of him.

444
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,460
That's not the point.

445
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:24,060
I know that you're concerned about that girl on the tape.

446
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,300
She will not be exposed.

447
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,950
We are handling that privately.

448
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,790
You blew it.

449
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:32,050
If you'd have listened,

450
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,050
we could've taken down the whole 18:20.

451
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,400
How?

452
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,960
You honestly think I would tell you now?

453
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,310
One way or another, that tape--

454
00:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,130
it's coming out.

455
00:19:41,190 --> 00:19:43,740
God has a way of bringing the truth to light.

456
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,320
Oh, my...

457
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,110
You have no idea what danger you've put us in.

458
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:50,840
We can protect you...

459
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,180
if I have that tape.

460
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:59,540
Well, it's hidden someplace you'd have to be crazy to look.

461
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:03,940
I had a feeling you were bluffing.

462
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:07,710
This room here is by invitation, Paul.

463
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:08,880
Hmm.

464
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:12,300
There is a tape.

465
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:13,380
Isn't there, Ginger?

466
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,050
I have a parade to get to.

467
00:20:19,150 --> 00:20:22,150
No tape. No witnesses.

468
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,630
You think you're the queen of New Orleans,

469
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:26,300
but, Margaret, it's Mardi Gras.

470
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,820
You don't even have a float.

471
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,980
Lord...

472
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:45,490
your words...

473
00:20:45,590 --> 00:20:48,990
did I follow them incorrectly?

474
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:53,250
Oh, my son--he wants so badly to be important in this world.

475
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:56,910
Like his daddy.

476
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:58,760
But he never knew him.

477
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,410
I blame myself. I failed him.

478
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:06,010
I promoted our family myth.

479
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:08,840
I led him to those faithless men.

480
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:14,090
Help me, Lord.

481
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:16,090
Help me save my boy.

482
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:19,760
I'm--I'm sorry. I can come back later.

483
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,760
No.

484
00:21:21,830 --> 00:21:23,930
Just give me a minute.

485
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:27,450
What--what is it, sweetie?

486
00:21:27,550 --> 00:21:30,290
I wanted to explain about the money.

487
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,050
My mom--she's not like you.

488
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,700
She's...

489
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:37,460
she's reckless.

490
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,810
And she owes, like, 80 grand in gambling debt.

491
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:45,710
And it's not just that. She makes the worst choices

492
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:48,780
without thinking.

493
00:21:48,930 --> 00:21:50,530
I'm listening.

494
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,460
She'd kill me for telling you,

495
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,650
but that tape--

496
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:58,390
No, no, you listen. I know Don.

497
00:21:58,610 --> 00:22:01,950
He knows me from way back. You get him on the phone.

498
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,280
You're gonna give him the message?

499
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:04,510
That's what you said the last time,

500
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:05,860
and the last time before that

501
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,180
and the last time before that, you...

502
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,110
Hi. If you've come to move in on my son some more,

503
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,780
he's not here.

504
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,130
Mrs. Candalaria, actually, I've come here to see you.

505
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:21,120
Well, make an appointment. I'm very busy.

506
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:24,590
It is you on that tape with Virgil, isn't it?

507
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,960
Antonio told me.

508
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,720
That makes you an eyewitness, and that, well...

509
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,050
that can give you choices.

510
00:22:33,190 --> 00:22:35,810
Why don't you just get the tape from Ginger?

511
00:22:36,010 --> 00:22:38,650
Well, to be honest, she won't give it to me.

512
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,490
'Cause she's cool like that.

513
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:41,650
You may not like the guy,

514
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,300
but he didn't do anything wrong.

515
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,900
I'm just here to protect my son.

516
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:49,890
One mother to another-- you did this.

517
00:22:49,950 --> 00:22:51,720
You made him soft, your boy.

518
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:52,910
You gotta let him clean up his own mess.

519
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,730
Well, this affects Antonio, too.

520
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,500
His birthright, his stake in the company,

521
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,320
and, uh, both your financial futures.

522
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,920
You don't know zilch about my finances.

523
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:08,430
How about $80,000, right here, right now?

524
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:14,690
I gotta go check up on the kid.

525
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,500
100.

526
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:20,690
$100,000?

527
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,440
If Antonio takes Jesus away from here today.

528
00:23:27,410 --> 00:23:29,370
You got a deal, fancy.

529
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,380
Oh, get these people out of my sight.

530
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,730
How's it dangling, Gotlove44? Whoo!

531
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,550
Oh, God, why have you forsaken me?

532
00:24:02,610 --> 00:24:04,130
YOPI: Hey, Don.

533
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:06,550
Looks like we won't be needing Ginger's tape.

534
00:24:06,610 --> 00:24:09,480
Mrs. Candalaria is ready and most willing

535
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:12,060
to tell her story to the nightly news.

536
00:24:16,030 --> 00:24:18,070
Okay, Margaret, First thing tomorrow,

537
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:22,750
Virgil will take an unexpected vacation from politics

538
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,980
due to an illness in the family

539
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,170
that requires his utmost attention--

540
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:28,580
that is, if you and Mrs. Candalaria

541
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:31,720
can keep this dreadful business to yourselves.

542
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:39,010
Anything else?

543
00:24:39,150 --> 00:24:41,770
Just one tiny thing.

544
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,920
Hey, Margaret, over here!

545
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,330
I love you!

546
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:14,620
You scream, I'll shoot, and nobody will hear either.

547
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,050
Weird.

548
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:33,380
Okay, uh, my dad used to take me here

549
00:26:33,540 --> 00:26:34,550
when I was a kid.

550
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,130
Like, literally, every Saturday,

551
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,960
he would give me an envelope full of cash,

552
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,210
and he would wait outside right there

553
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,450
until I had spent every penny.

554
00:26:41,550 --> 00:26:43,140
There was no fuss.

555
00:26:43,230 --> 00:26:48,050
There was no Mama judging my every decision.

556
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:51,720
It was just all that fabric

557
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,310
and him and me.

558
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:56,390
Why would they want to meet here?

559
00:26:56,450 --> 00:26:58,970
Same reason we're giving them money they don't deserve.

560
00:26:59,030 --> 00:26:59,910
It's insanity.

561
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,800
"Jason"! 'Sup, man?

562
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,580
Oh, don't "'sup" me, okay?

563
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:05,970
You're lucky I'm anti-gun.

564
00:27:05,990 --> 00:27:08,310
Oh, come on. Nothing personal.

565
00:27:08,370 --> 00:27:09,920
This is strictly financial.

566
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:12,160
Okay, you're gonna take this money,

567
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:15,480
and you are never gonna bother anyone in my family again.

568
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:17,500
Do you understand? 'Cause I know people.

569
00:27:17,660 --> 00:27:21,170
I do. I, like, actually know people.

570
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,770
No, I feel you. Yeah.

571
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,840
Do you know who he really is?

572
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:27,440
Yes, I know exactly who he is.

573
00:27:27,630 --> 00:27:29,110
And you know what? I know who you are, too,

574
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,180
because people like you have been bothering

575
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:33,850
my family for my entire life.

576
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,430
The story always ends the same way,

577
00:27:35,490 --> 00:27:38,020
so, I don't know, when you blow all of that money

578
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:41,680
or when you lose it or when someone steals it,

579
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:43,700
I want you to remember

580
00:27:43,790 --> 00:27:48,460
it is because of what you did to Mark,

581
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:50,520
because it was not nice,

582
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:53,540
and it was not fair, and I curse you.

583
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:57,950
It is Mardi Gras, and I am placing a voodoo curse.

584
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:02,380
A voodoo curse?

585
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,880
Who are you right now?

586
00:28:05,980 --> 00:28:07,720
I want to get lost.

587
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:10,480
I want to just hide in plain sight.

588
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,480
Come on, Rocky Raccoon. Let's go celebrate.

589
00:28:32,290 --> 00:28:36,900
Here's the situation, Ms. Sweet.

590
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,920
You're not gonna give me trouble or back-talk.

591
00:28:39,010 --> 00:28:41,090
And while you're not doing that,

592
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,290
you're gonna tell me where you're hiding

593
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:46,180
the Governor's little-tape-that-could.

594
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:52,310
Where's the tape?

595
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,360
Where's the tape?

596
00:29:04,890 --> 00:29:08,110
It's at the motel.

597
00:29:08,270 --> 00:29:10,770
"The wages of the righteous is life,

598
00:29:10,830 --> 00:29:16,210
but the earnings of the wicked is sin and death."

599
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,710
Words to live...

600
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:21,550
or die by.

601
00:29:21,750 --> 00:29:22,720
Here we go.

602
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:34,880
Hey, you want some bling bling, you gotta work for it.

603
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,460
Show us your boobs.

604
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:41,480
Dude, we should throw them some money.

605
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:43,480
We got enough.

606
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:45,480
Income equality. I love it.

607
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:49,910
Whoa. Where did it go?

608
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,990
Dude

609
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,480
That rich witch cursed us.

610
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:02,430
Which was rude.

611
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,160
Antonio.

612
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,680
She sold you out, Margaret.

613
00:30:14,770 --> 00:30:15,510
Who did?

614
00:30:15,650 --> 00:30:17,970
My mom. She...

615
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,680
she was playing you the whole time.

616
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,610
She made a deal with Don Bouchard to get me a big fight.

617
00:30:22,760 --> 00:30:23,780
Thank you.

618
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:25,670
I know this wasn't easy for you.

619
00:30:25,730 --> 00:30:30,120
I'm so sorry. She can't seem to help herself.

620
00:30:35,350 --> 00:30:36,780
YOPI: You nenes gonna give my boy the fight, or what?

621
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,000
I want that money in my account by tomorrow afternoon.

622
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,800
Mama, look at me, huh?

623
00:30:46,950 --> 00:30:48,810
Guess I learned to fight above my weight class.

624
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,380
Didn't I, Don?

625
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,300
Chin up, tiny.

626
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:09,160
Don't worry. It's under control.

627
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,670
I tried to live honest,

628
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:19,890
but sadly, it never took.

629
00:31:19,910 --> 00:31:22,320
So I thought,

630
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:26,580
"What if I could be bad for the good?"

631
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:31,350
And that's why I am here right now.

632
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:33,000
Helping the good,

633
00:31:33,060 --> 00:31:35,730
which is bad for you.

634
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:40,510
You should never have children, by the way.

635
00:31:40,530 --> 00:31:43,010
I'm not saying the bad can't have them,

636
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,270
but you should steer clear

637
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:48,700
on account of your profession.

638
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,530
That sort of thing gets handed down.

639
00:31:50,690 --> 00:31:51,850
I should know.

640
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,430
My mother was a real whore, too.

641
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:01,380
Now...

642
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:05,530
If you're lying to me and there's another copy

643
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:07,440
of that tape out there somewhere,

644
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:11,390
I promise I will find you,

645
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:15,390
and that will be a bad day for us both.

646
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:26,950
You have a lovely evening.

647
00:32:39,790 --> 00:32:40,920
Jesus.

648
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:49,340
When Jesus walked.

649
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:52,840
RACHEL: Oh, my God.

650
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:55,490
Can't believe I had that many hurricanes.

651
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,850
I wasn't even counting.

652
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,670
Oh, shoot. I forgot my phone again.

653
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,820
I will meet you at the bar.

654
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:07,180
WOMAN: All right, we'll see you there.

655
00:33:07,320 --> 00:33:08,430
WOMAN: And don't take too long.

656
00:33:10,930 --> 00:33:12,620
Lord, you scared me.

657
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:16,770
Did you film me? Like the governor?

658
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:19,940
Did you film us?

659
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,710
I deleted them.

660
00:33:24,250 --> 00:33:26,780
Soon as your mom got involved,

661
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:30,130
I deleted every single minute.

662
00:33:30,330 --> 00:33:31,450
You have to believe me.

663
00:33:31,550 --> 00:33:33,210
- Every minute? - Everything--

664
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,450
- Every word we said? - Everything.

665
00:33:34,510 --> 00:33:36,790
- - Delete-Everything, everything.

666
00:33:36,850 --> 00:33:39,370
I'm so sorry.

667
00:33:39,390 --> 00:33:42,540
How am I supposed to believe you?

668
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:45,730
Because you're the guy.

669
00:33:47,470 --> 00:33:49,970
You'll be totally fine.

670
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,480
Ginger?

671
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,710
GINGER: Go away.

672
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:12,830
Let me in, sweetie.

673
00:34:12,890 --> 00:34:13,990
Just go away.

674
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:16,680
I can't do that.

675
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:19,500
I need that tape. I have...

676
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:21,090
I have tried every way I know how,

677
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:24,100
but I can't protect you or this family without it.

678
00:34:24,250 --> 00:34:25,910
You only protect yourself.

679
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:27,950
GINGER: We kids are just collateral damage.

680
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,820
No. That is not true, Ginger.

681
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:34,090
Just leave me alone.

682
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:38,350
Are you okay?

683
00:34:38,450 --> 00:34:41,580
Something wrong?

684
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,860
I can hear it in your voice. Please.

685
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,340
Talk to me.

686
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:51,960
I wish you would.

687
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,790
I will pray for you.

688
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:19,330
Heels stay on.

689
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:30,420
Franklin, I need you to come home.

690
00:35:38,250 --> 00:35:39,910
Come on.

691
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:41,840
Come on.

692
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:53,590
Go away, Margaret!

693
00:35:53,650 --> 00:35:55,110
BECKY: Wrong Monreaux, wench.

694
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:58,260
I know he's in here. Where is he?

695
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,510
Who?

696
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:00,840
Eric.

697
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,620
Here's here with one of your concubines,

698
00:36:02,790 --> 00:36:06,120
and I want him returned to me with his earthly soul intact

699
00:36:06,320 --> 00:36:08,000
and ripe for the Lord's bounty.

700
00:36:28,650 --> 00:36:30,940
You sure you don't want to talk about it?

701
00:36:32,820 --> 00:36:37,380
'Cause you know I've been down the warpath with Margaret.

702
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,880
Heck, she's the reason

703
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,720
girls like us even know what power looks like.

704
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,550
I knew what power looked like way before I met Margaret,

705
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,890
thank you very much.

706
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:49,310
Yeah, but no one wields it like her.

707
00:36:49,330 --> 00:36:54,150
Plus, she does it with this infuriating steadfast faith.

708
00:36:54,210 --> 00:36:58,070
Why is it that everyone in this town seems to think

709
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:01,250
that Margaret holds the monopoly on God's love?

710
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,510
Please. That woman doesn't hold

711
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,350
a monopoly on a thing.

712
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:07,020
She's just blessed in Christ.

713
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:12,250
How do you know that?

714
00:37:12,350 --> 00:37:14,080
Because she's rich.

715
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:16,980
And I'm some sinner who missed my blessing?

716
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,530
I should really be going.

717
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:37,200
Great idea, fundie.

718
00:37:37,290 --> 00:37:39,720
Feel better, trollop.

719
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:51,640
Today was awesome, wasn't it?

720
00:37:51,730 --> 00:37:54,550
I mean, we went to three parades,

721
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:57,550
two bars, and a caper.

722
00:37:57,610 --> 00:38:00,630
As long as we had our masks on.

723
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:01,810
I don't belong here.

724
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,630
What do you mean you don't belong?

725
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,650
Impersonating my brother,

726
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:07,970
going on Christian talk TV,

727
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:12,320
and then being blackmailed by my two idiot friends.

728
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,920
This whole thing is a farce.

729
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:17,660
Are we living a farce?

730
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:21,420
My life is not a farce, Jason.

731
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:25,670
It is what it is, and it's mine.

732
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,920
And for the life of me, I'm trying to keep you in it.

733
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,940
Game on, creep.

734
00:38:53,370 --> 00:38:54,680
You knit.

735
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:56,110
They won't give me any whiskey here,

736
00:38:56,130 --> 00:38:58,690
so yes, Franklin, I'm knitting.

737
00:38:58,750 --> 00:39:00,300
What are you doing here?

738
00:39:00,450 --> 00:39:03,020
Just came to check on you. Can't a person do that?

739
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,780
Not a person who works for the Monreauxs.

740
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:07,290
Well, I've worked for the Monreauxs

741
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,710
my whole entire life.

742
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:11,720
My mother before me. I'm good at it.

743
00:39:11,870 --> 00:39:13,380
But sometimes I can't help but feel

744
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,890
like I'm living for the dead.

745
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,870
Funny how that happens in the South.

746
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:19,870
- I mean, the same tired story. - Mm.

747
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:22,800
Our lives are not stories, Franklin.

748
00:39:22,860 --> 00:39:25,710
They're happening. Right now.

749
00:39:27,110 --> 00:39:29,330
One day sober, and you're this smart.

750
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:30,810
I read it in a pamphlet.

751
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,560
You know, today is the anniversary

752
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:37,220
of my mother's death.

753
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:39,000
Five years gone.

754
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,120
I'm sorry.

755
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,410
Don't be.

756
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:44,430
I couldn't do much for my mother.

757
00:39:44,430 --> 00:39:46,420
But I can certainly help Ginger avenge you.

758
00:39:46,570 --> 00:39:47,740
How?

759
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:49,250
By releasing that tape she gave you.

760
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:51,010
Ginger's playing with fire.

761
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:53,500
She's in way over her head.

762
00:39:53,560 --> 00:39:55,260
Ginger said she hid it someplace

763
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:58,930
you'd have to be crazy to look.

764
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,250
I'm the craziest.

765
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,680
Honestly, I sat with my mother all day today.

766
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:10,020
There was nobody I trusted more.

767
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,940
I figured Ginger felt the same way about you.

768
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:17,420
You and I both want to keep her safe.

769
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:29,720
The past is too big a burden.

770
00:40:29,870 --> 00:40:32,610
If I'm ever gonna be well,

771
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:35,280
I can't drag it along with me.

772
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:41,620
Don't I know it.

773
00:40:46,350 --> 00:40:47,960
Oh, poor Virgil.

774
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:50,720
The family values politician finds himself

775
00:40:50,780 --> 00:40:52,740
in an adulterous sex scandal.

776
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:56,320
Ruined by a drunk with a thumb drive.

777
00:40:58,170 --> 00:41:01,420
Now, you know the governor's not gonna take this lying down.

778
00:41:01,590 --> 00:41:03,420
As long as Eric is safe.

779
00:41:03,610 --> 00:41:05,900
Margaret.

780
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:09,980
Oh, Ginger.

781
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,820
You've ruined me.

782
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:15,260
Without trusting subscribers, SaintWagon is finished.

783
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,010
Your mother--she chose to give us that tape, and--

784
00:41:18,100 --> 00:41:20,140
You people are so low.

785
00:41:21,810 --> 00:41:24,010
Why not look at this as an opportunity for change?

786
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:26,020
You crossed a line.

787
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,610
You came for my business.

788
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,500
Now I'm coming for yours.

789
00:41:30,560 --> 00:41:32,860
Ginger, wait.

790
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:35,530
To think that I actually trusted you.

791
00:41:35,620 --> 00:41:37,100
My mom was right.

792
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:40,110
My dad is watching all of us.

793
00:41:40,120 --> 00:41:44,670
And he knows exactly what you just did to his daughter.

794
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,010
MARGARET: Franklin?
