1
00:00:02,020 --> 00:00:03,240
Dear Lord, is it just me

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:05,410
or are the hidden things being made manifest?

3
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:07,730
To hang onto her last shred  of maternal dignity,

4
00:00:07,750 --> 00:00:10,060
Margaret proposed a loyalty test.

5
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:11,900
- 6 million each.  - Eric refused.

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,420
As a reward,  Madge finally made him CEO.

7
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:16,010
Too little too late, I say.

8
00:00:16,130 --> 00:00:17,680
Eric's whores.

9
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,350
Rose and the ungrateful slut  took the money

10
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,160
to launch Rose's  fashion line,

11
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:22,910
and to cheer me up, asked me to model.

12
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:24,240
Blush.

13
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:26,350
But I had my eyes on the true showstopper:

14
00:00:26,470 --> 00:00:28,520
Eric's bimbo.  And Jason?

15
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,430
He walked in saying something about a dead brother.

16
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,860
We don't have to lie anymore.

17
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,510
We need the money!

18
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:35,090
So Jason ran off with the thirsty cougar.

19
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:36,760
She's his mother.

20
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,370
Yopi and the fighter for God took the money.

21
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:39,930
Apparently, she has big league plans.

22
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:41,430
You lose the first fight,

23
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,020
and everybody gets rich off of the action.

24
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:44,690
Back at the fashion show,

25
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,770
Rose finished strong,  thanks to me.

26
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,360
She's carrying the Beast.

27
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,690
Meanwhile, the reporter is still sniffling around.

28
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,880
The pilot of Eugene Monreaux's

29
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,110
private plane is on there.

30
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:54,960
The Lord took his cancer away.

31
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,110
Heaven only knows what  scandal he'll dig up next.

32
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:59,550
- I want to testify. - You're supposed to be dead.

33
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,890
Because it seems like everyone has a secret.

34
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,800
Question is,  whose is the biggest?

35
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,950
You took your brother's life?

36
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,900
We do this, it changes everything.

37
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:09,450
Whoever said you're only as sick

38
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:11,140
as your secrets had it all wrong.

39
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:14,530
In Jesus' name, amen.

40
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:20,240
Tonight is gonna be  very, very special.

41
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,820
I'll meet you at our spot.

42
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:24,750
I'll be there. Wait for me.

43
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:29,830
I know this is not

44
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:31,830
what you'd normally  expect from us,

45
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,920
but we are expanding our horizons.

46
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:39,170
Tonight, the Sunshine Network launches

47
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:41,670
its new subscription package:

48
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:43,510
Praise-per-view.

49
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:45,490
Can you believe it?

50
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,680
450,000 of you

51
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:52,010
have already signed up for tonight's premiere event,

52
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,280
featuring our very own Warrior for Christ,

53
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,950
Antonio Rivera.

54
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:01,860
Yes!

55
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,860
As I'm sure you might've guessed,

56
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:05,530
cage matches?

57
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:07,790
Not exactly Margaret's cup of tea.

58
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,670
Why don't you tell me

59
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,460
Exactly what is going on

60
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,630
But this, this is Antonio's dream.

61
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:19,690
So tune in tonight at 9:00 p.m.

62
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:23,140
to watch our very own Antonio Rivera

63
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,700
face off with the... Chechen Bear.

64
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:30,390
You join us then, won't you?

65
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,810
Today alone,  another 50,000 viewers

66
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:36,540
have subscribed to SunnyClub to get the fight.

67
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,210
That's unbelievable.

68
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:40,320
Well, what the hell do I know?

69
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,990
I just hope he doesn't get hurt.

70
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:45,160
Oh, Antonio has been training his whole life to get here.

71
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,740
You've got to trust that he'll be fine,

72
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,550
and that goes for everybody.

73
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,410
Rose has her fashion line.

74
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:52,890
- Eric is CEO. - And we are?

75
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,560
We are exactly what we've always been.

76
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:00,070
Only more so.

77
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:01,180
Good.

78
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,840
So will you be my date for the fight?

79
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,180
Oh, Lord.

80
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,760
I've allowed this,

81
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,760
but that doesn't mean I have the stomach to watch.

82
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,760
Big step.

83
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,510
What do you think?

84
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,010
It's got good water pressure.

85
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:20,010
And it's in an excellent and open-minded school district.

86
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,360
- This house isn't for us. - I'm not a lesbian.

87
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,920
I just assumed--

88
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,590
I'm buying this house for me and my mom.

89
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:27,520
She's coming home this week.

90
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,190
Besides...she's married.

91
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,040
It's perfect. She'll take it.

92
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,500
I'll start the paperwork.

93
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,770
That wasn't funny.

94
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,250
It's not completely crazy, though,

95
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,770
to think this could be ours.

96
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,220
If you weren't 11 months pregnant

97
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:47,050
and married to my brother.

98
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,060
Eric and I had to get married.

99
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:55,120
I don't think he ever really loved me anyway.

100
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,140
You have the main players in Louisiana,

101
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,420
but the 18:20 has chapters in every state in the country--

102
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,050
Thank you.

103
00:04:04,070 --> 00:04:05,410
And in most countries in the world,

104
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,220
but what's Margaret doing up there?

105
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,580
A majority of homicides can be traced back to the spouse.

106
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,490
Homicides?

107
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,990
The plane crash was an accident,

108
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:15,900
an act of God to set me on a different path.

109
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,230
God's not my working theory.

110
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,900
How did Reverend Paul become your spiritual advisor?

111
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,170
Paul and Becky were in our Praise Choir.

112
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:28,260
Paul was talented, and he loved attention.

113
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:32,680
But he is really in the confession racket.

114
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,940
He would get secrets out of powerful men

115
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:40,420
then he'd own them.

116
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,360
Maybe powerful men should have fewer secrets.

117
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:53,450
I know you don't feel good about this,

118
00:04:53,570 --> 00:04:54,790
but remember,

119
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,030
first fight you lose,

120
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,130
second fight you win, all right?

121
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:00,460
Third fight, you fight fair.

122
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,520
Hey, it's a trilogy.

123
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,540
Like the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost or...

124
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:06,020
the real Star Wars.

125
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,490
- Rivera? - You Don Jr.?

126
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:10,210
Brett, VP of Bouchard Enterprises.

127
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,640
You must be Yopi.

128
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,290
My father's told me all about you.

129
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,810
Good things, I hope.

130
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,650
And it's Mrs. Candalaria to you.

131
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,390
Warrior, I'd like to introduce you to your worthy opponent,

132
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,650
the Chechen Bear.

133
00:05:23,770 --> 00:05:25,390
Let's give the people a show.

134
00:05:25,510 --> 00:05:28,820
Maybe you bleed a little, I bleed a little.

135
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:31,490
Early in second, I catch you in arm bar,

136
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,250
you tap, everybody happy.

137
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,310
How they say, make it rain?

138
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:40,670
Hey, let's be friends tonight, yeah?

139
00:05:40,830 --> 00:05:42,750
If this is real, I kill you.

140
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,170
Brett, you tell your dad not to worry.

141
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:48,070
My boy's gonna come through for everybody.

142
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:49,570
He won't disappoint you.

143
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,680
Arm bar in second. Got it.

144
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,250
So it's finally finished,

145
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,590
and I really hope you like it.

146
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:57,260
Rose Monreaux, as I live and breathe.

147
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,910
Brett?

148
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:00,190
Are you working for your dad now?

149
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:02,000
Yeah. Yeah, I am, yeah.

150
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:04,020
And what happened to your Supreme Court dreams?

151
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:05,750
The family business is much more lucrative

152
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:07,190
than career public servant.

153
00:06:07,350 --> 00:06:08,440
You two know each other?

154
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,940
We were supposed to get married.

155
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,260
Worst mistake of my life letting this one get away.

156
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:17,700
You slept with my bridesmaids, all of them, and I dumped you.

157
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,690
You were always so direct.

158
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,290
Mmm, I miss that. Let's go.

159
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,950
Thank you for this.

160
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,300
Nice lingerie.

161
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,790
That reporter is asking about the missions.

162
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,130
18:20 don't talk to the press. You know that.

163
00:06:34,210 --> 00:06:35,560
We need to get ahead of the story.

164
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,870
We need to open up our books,

165
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,060
take responsibility for past corruption.

166
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:42,120
Corruption is a very ugly word, Eric.

167
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,970
Well, as CEO, Paul, I have made a decision.

168
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:47,880
Going forward, instead of 20%,

169
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,050
we will be dedicating 50% of SunnyClub profits

170
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:52,910
to restoring our missions.

171
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,820
50% will bankrupt the company.

172
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,990
We'll be back in the black within the decade.

173
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,950
I'll be dead by then, boy.

174
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,400
Eric's gonna cost us everything.

175
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,420
- We got to get rid of him. - He's married to my sister.

176
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:09,150
Well, if he's not out, I'm pulling my money.

177
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:11,070
Don't pull your money out, Don.

178
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:14,760
18:20 is about to get a shot of fresh blood.

179
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:19,660
You're avoiding me.

180
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,010
You noticed.

181
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,270
I'm sorry for what happened.

182
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,260
I was a different man back then.

183
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,590
People don't change, Brett.

184
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:30,430
You should tell that to Aunt Veronica

185
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:32,700
'cause it looks like she hooked a real live one.

186
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,790
Excuse me, I'm not feeling well.

187
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:45,790
So are we not talking anymore?

188
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,300
You seem to have no problem chatting up rich women.

189
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,840
Rose...

190
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,430
Veronica is my mother.

191
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:02,120
Wait, Daddy and Aunt Veronica?

192
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:07,560
No, but you're not her son. You're Mark.

193
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:09,300
Mark's gone, okay?

194
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,060
Veronica just wants to spoil a son she's never known,

195
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:14,380
and at least somebody can be happy.

196
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,990
You're lying to her.

197
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,900
It's the same lie.

198
00:08:17,990 --> 00:08:20,720
And you were fine with it when it was about us.

199
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,550
Excuse me, I have some work to do.

200
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,980
Besides, I don't wanna break her heart.

201
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Why stop breaking hearts now?

202
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:31,490
Members of the press,

203
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,660
please gather for the official weigh-in.

204
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,420
- Gather for the weigh-in. - Mrs. Monreaux.

205
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,490
Oh, Brett. Aren't you looking well.

206
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,160
Last time I saw you, you were picking out centerpieces

207
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,740
for me and Rose's wedding reception.

208
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:45,690
I'm surprised you remember that after having so many beers.

209
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,020
Please join

210
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,250
- the Sunshine Network... - Good to see you, dear.

211
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,510
In welcoming  our master of ceremony...

212
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:53,010
- That's my cue.  - Brett Beauregard Bouchard.

213
00:08:54,530 --> 00:08:59,590
Ladies and gentlemen...

214
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,520
Bouchard Enterprises,

215
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,260
in association with the Sunshine Network,

216
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:06,100
sponsored by the Open Carry Open Range,

217
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,520
because the Second Amendment includes your right

218
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,930
to a cold beer.

219
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,620
- Hey, sweetie. - Hey.

220
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:16,780
Well, it's funny running into Brett after all this time.

221
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:18,370
I guess.

222
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:23,870
Is it hot in here or is it just me?

223
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:26,620
Rose...

224
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:29,470
I'm so proud of you, but I want you to go your own way.

225
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,900
And I want you to know I support

226
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:33,050
your new business 100%.

227
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:36,490
Sweetie, you okay?

228
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,720
Yeah, yeah. I've just--

229
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,890
I've been taking orders nonstop since the fashion show,

230
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,320
and I've been making all the clothes for the fight,

231
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,990
and I think I'm just exhausted.

232
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:53,590
Ishtar Deela!

233
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,090
155.

234
00:09:57,250 --> 00:09:59,090
Deela makes weight.

235
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,250
Kay, girls, Yopi said offshore sites only,

236
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:06,660
no wagers over 20K or they'll be flagged.

237
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,750
As soon as she gives us the signal to go,

238
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:12,000
place all 6 million as fast as you can.

239
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,110
Now coming to the scales,

240
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:17,520
from Queens, New York, with eight victories, four knockouts

241
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:19,110
against a single blemish,

242
00:10:19,190 --> 00:10:23,120
the Warrior for Christ, Antonio Rivera.

243
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,960
The Warrior's wardrobe is courtesy of Armoire du Rose,

244
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:33,130
coming soon, exclusively through SunnyClub.

245
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,520
156.5. Rivera doesn't make weight.

246
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:39,470
What do you mean Rivera doesn't make weight?

247
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,640
Can--can we get a towel, please?

248
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,260
A towel?

249
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,640
Strip.

250
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:00,990
No.

251
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,160
He has one hour to cut the weight.

252
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:07,160
Rivera has one hour to cut weight

253
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:08,830
or match goes to Deela.

254
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,740
I'm sorry, I'm--I'm selling on SunnyClub?

255
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,170
Isn't that what you always dreamed of?

256
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:17,320
Once, before I knew better.

257
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,160
Mama, Ginger has setup a week of meetings

258
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,840
with buyers for me in New York.

259
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:23,570
When were you gonna tell me?

260
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,070
I just did.

261
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:28,920
You're nauseous, you're overly tired...

262
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,060
Rose, are you pregnant?

263
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,200
Thank you.

264
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:46,090
And I'm just doing this to satisfy you.

265
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,660
I'm positive it will be negative.

266
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:53,430
Ginger, have a seat.

267
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:56,540
I hear congratulations are in order.

268
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,050
Rose, oh, she is so excited about everything

269
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,620
that the two of you have in the works.

270
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,200
Is this really what you wanna talk about right now?

271
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,200
Did you know that it was always Rose's dream

272
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:12,390
to sell her designs on SunnyClub exclusively?

273
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,040
Well, SunnyClub isn't her dream anymore.

274
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,800
She's evolved.

275
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,900
Like you, you know, hosting this whole fight thing.

276
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:21,880
I know my daughter.

277
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,390
If she abandons her faith,

278
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,240
she will never forgive herself.

279
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:44,590
Hey. It's okay.

280
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,250
That was really stupid what you did.

281
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:54,430
I didn't do anything, Ma.

282
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:55,840
No, I know you better than you know yourself.

283
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,100
You gained that weight so you wouldn't have to fight.

284
00:12:58,220 --> 00:12:59,680
So what if I did?

285
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:01,420
It's a sauna in here.

286
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,780
Well, that's the point, genius.

287
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:04,610
It's supposed to melt away the two extra pounds.

288
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:06,260
Well, he better 'cause half a million people didn't pay

289
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,450
to watch him forfeit.

290
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:09,100
We're building the drama here.

291
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,830
Tell Don we'll be right out.

292
00:13:19,020 --> 00:13:21,690
Laxatives?

293
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:26,300
Sweetie, we can't look at this as anything but His blessing.

294
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,450
We've got a lot to plan for

295
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:29,790
with Brett and the wedding, and now--

296
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,200
No!

297
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:32,620
I am not Eric.

298
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,810
You cannot force me into a shotgun wedding.

299
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:38,720
How do you propose to solve this problem?

300
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,460
Could you please just give me a few minutes to think?

301
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:51,900
You know where you can find me if, uh...if you wanna talk.

302
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,390
Why did you let her think Brett is the father?

303
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,820
What was I supposed to tell her?

304
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:04,820
That it's Jason? My...brother?

305
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:07,820
Oh, God.

306
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,490
How could I have let this happen?

307
00:14:09,550 --> 00:14:12,390
I'm so stupid.

308
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,000
Here.

309
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:20,020
I don't wanna tell you what to do.

310
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,500
Okay? But just hear me out.

311
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,170
There are things in New York

312
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:28,270
that you can't get in Louisiana,

313
00:14:28,390 --> 00:14:29,900
at least not easily.

314
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,990
I know that you are just trying to help.

315
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:39,710
I need a few minutes alone, please.

316
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:41,690
Mm. Yeah.

317
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:44,270
I took Rose  for granted, you know?

318
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:46,710
But I had the whole family on my ass

319
00:14:46,830 --> 00:14:48,200
that I had to settle down.

320
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:51,110
You can't rise in the world without a ball and chain.

321
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,630
It sucks for single men in the world today.

322
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,280
If you're not married by our age,

323
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:57,220
everyone thinks you're gay.

324
00:14:57,340 --> 00:15:00,730
Not that there's too much wrong with that.

325
00:15:00,890 --> 00:15:02,300
You're her brother.

326
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,640
Put in a good word for me?

327
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:05,570
There he is!

328
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:08,460
I'm looking at the future of the 18:20 right here,

329
00:15:08,460 --> 00:15:09,900
right now.

330
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:12,720
Mr. Conley, may I have a word, please, in private?

331
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,480
That would be great.

332
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,580
I have just come from a very troubling meeting.

333
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,060
Okay.

334
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,910
Evidently, there's this reporter.

335
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:22,730
He'd been sniffing around past Sunshine Network's shenanigans.

336
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:25,490
And your brother? He's overreacting.

337
00:15:25,590 --> 00:15:27,400
Now with your shares and Don's,

338
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:29,810
we can take back ownership stake of this company.

339
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,760
We can make sure that your brother doesn't go rogue.

340
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,830
The family business isn't really my jam.

341
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:36,410
I just took the shares to make Veronica happy.

342
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,770
Exactly, so you should be able to enjoy your money

343
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:39,990
without all this headache.

344
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,340
Here's what I propose:

345
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,940
you sign over power of attorney.

346
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,830
You let me represent Veronica's interests.

347
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:47,420
I don't know if she'd like that.

348
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:48,680
Well, I don't know if she'd like hearing

349
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,670
about how you killed your brother in Colorado.

350
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:55,510
I didn't kill my brother. I brought him back to God.

351
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:58,680
And I told you that in secret...

352
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,250
when I was at my lowest.

353
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,530
What you're doing is wrong.

354
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:08,690
Well, you can get it all right with God

355
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:12,050
by helping save a Christian network.

356
00:16:13,530 --> 00:16:16,050
Power of attorney.

357
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,460
Everyone submits eventually.

358
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:34,490
155.

359
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,640
155. He makes weight.

360
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,470
The fight is on.

361
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:40,490
Thanks, man.

362
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:41,890
Come to bless the fight?

363
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:45,390
Brett, I never pried into why you and Rose

364
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:47,060
broke off your engagement.

365
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:48,170
I actually appreciate that, ma'am.

366
00:16:48,330 --> 00:16:49,990
But this...

367
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,910
this is a moral responsibility

368
00:16:52,030 --> 00:16:55,400
that lasts a lifetime,

369
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,420
and I expect you to do right by my daughter.

370
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:00,240
Look, there must be some mistake.

371
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,680
Today's the first time I've seen Rose in...a year.

372
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,980
But if I find the guy, I'll kick his ass for you.

373
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:16,750
I know that's what my father promised you,

374
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,350
but I'm not my father, all right?

375
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:20,700
- No, I'm sorry.  - Now wait just a minute!

376
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,190
Everyone's at the fight. What are you doing back here?

377
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:26,040
Making enemies.

378
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,360
Look at you.

379
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:28,950
You're a sight for sore eyes.

380
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:31,380
I want a divorce.

381
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,870
What? You--you serious?

382
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,370
Yeah.

383
00:17:38,430 --> 00:17:40,390
I think that's just the hormones talking.

384
00:17:40,550 --> 00:17:41,890
Why don't you sit down? I'll call the doctor.

385
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,710
No, no, I don't need the doctor,

386
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,230
but you might if you mention my hormones again.

387
00:17:47,790 --> 00:17:48,940
Okay.

388
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:52,790
I, uh, I don't understand.

389
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,310
I--you know, I thought things

390
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:55,810
were going so much better.

391
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:57,800
This isn't what I want from my life.

392
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,630
Okay, well, welcome to the club, Becky, right?

393
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:00,980
This is how it goes. This is what we do.

394
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,820
We have to make sacrifices for our baby.

395
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,730
You of all people know that it is wrong

396
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,730
to raise a baby in a house of lies.

397
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,060
It's not fair for a baby, it's not fair for us.

398
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,320
I'm sorry.

399
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,990
Eric, I've been looking for you.

400
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:13,240
Hey, Becky.

401
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,610
Eric and I are getting divorced.

402
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:17,420
- No. -I'm sorry.

403
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,500
I know that Eric is finally CEO,

404
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,000
and that SunnyClub is about to launch--

405
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:22,500
No.

406
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,750
How selfish are you? What about me?

407
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,880
What about everything that I've worked for?

408
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:30,180
Hey, hey, it's my fault. I had an affair.

409
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:33,180
If there are problems in this marriage, they're on me.

410
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,920
I'm taking full responsibility.

411
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:37,150
- Okay, I'll move out tonight. - No.

412
00:18:38,950 --> 00:18:41,190
I had an affair too.

413
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,830
Wait, what? You did?

414
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:46,030
Yeah.

415
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:52,960
No, no.

416
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:55,960
You're right. You're right.

417
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,860
A partnership only works

418
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,740
if everyone wants the same thing.

419
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,120
We all deserve to be happy.

420
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:06,960
Let's just--let's keep this between us

421
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,720
till after the launch next week.

422
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:11,290
Eric, you focus on the missions.

423
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,220
Becky, go home, get some rest.

424
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:16,890
Everything's gonna be fine.

425
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,540
God has a plan for everything,

426
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,320
and we will find our way through this.

427
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,570
Is he on drugs?

428
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:31,890
When we wanted to get rid of someone

429
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,580
we always sent a man named Hagamond Sheen.

430
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:38,410
He became one of Paul's disciples.

431
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,490
Oh, I'm familiar with Hagamond Sheen

432
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,580
and his handlers.

433
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,990
But what's the motive?

434
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,250
Control.

435
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,920
I've seen how he uses Eric

436
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,090
since I've been out of the way.

437
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,670
When Eric gets wise, he'll just use someone else.

438
00:19:53,690 --> 00:19:54,850
Control of what, though?

439
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:56,190
I mean, he has millions of followers.

440
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,860
The missions.

441
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,430
The missions are key to everything.

442
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:03,700
We use them as a bank.

443
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:06,110
Tax deductions.

444
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,850
Stolen donations funneled through a maze of LLCs.

445
00:20:10,930 --> 00:20:14,690
People are always very generous in times of crisis.

446
00:20:14,770 --> 00:20:18,440
So we keep the world in perpetual crisis.

447
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:20,620
Do you have receipts?

448
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,050
Do you have a computer

449
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,430
Speak of the devil.

450
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:32,730
Come in.

451
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:38,230
Franklin, I'm scared.

452
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,480
I'm listening.

453
00:20:41,590 --> 00:20:44,030
I don't know how to do this.

454
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:50,890
I don't know how to fix this.

455
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:54,320
I just blew it with Rose.

456
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:56,990
For a second there, I thought you were talking about us.

457
00:20:57,110 --> 00:20:59,590
I might as well be, I suppose.

458
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,260
All this change, it's just happening too fast.

459
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,260
Way too fast.

460
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:11,660
Change is a good thing.

461
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:15,250
You know that I've never been with anyone besides Eugene.

462
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:16,990
You've been adored

463
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,850
but you've never been with a man who loves you.

464
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,500
I need to take it slow.

465
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,190
Half a lifetime isn't slow enough?

466
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:33,290
I'll come and find you at the fight.

467
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:36,120
- You'll wait for me? -I've waited this long.

468
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,790
But Margaret...

469
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:43,960
Don't be scared to be loved.

470
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:51,470
Well, Paul thinks we should wait to announce the split

471
00:21:51,590 --> 00:21:53,200
until after the launch.

472
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,700
Sure, that, uh, makes sense.

473
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,460
Is that Yopi? Should we place the bets?

474
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,890
It's not Yopi. Not yet.

475
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:00,540
Hey, come watch the fight with me.

476
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:02,890
I can't. I'm watching Jesus.

477
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:05,860
Then I'll come to you. Wait for me.

478
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,550
I know about you and Rose.

479
00:22:09,550 --> 00:22:12,830
- She told you? - It's a big secret to keep.

480
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:18,660
I know it's been really hard on you both

481
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:21,000
but she needs you now.

482
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,390
What? What's going on?

483
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:25,750
Hey, dude

484
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:27,750
why didn't you tell me your sister was knocked up?

485
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:30,490
I don't do sloppy seconds.

486
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:45,080
Excuse me. I need to get this to Antonio.

487
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,690
I want the baby.

488
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:51,110
- Who told you? - Margaret.

489
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:54,110
Well, she told Brett and then Brett told me.

490
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:57,330
That guy sucks.

491
00:22:58,730 --> 00:22:59,950
I just want to do the right thing.

492
00:23:00,070 --> 00:23:03,880
It is one thing to double down on fraud

493
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:06,790
and maybe go to jail

494
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:08,960
but it is another thing entirely

495
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:11,460
to put that on an innocent child.

496
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:14,040
Okay, yeah. No, you're right.

497
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,720
If you don't want to have the baby with me

498
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,450
just give it up for adoption.

499
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:22,300
You know, like I was adopted. I turned out okay, basically.

500
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:24,560
Everybody seems to have an opinion on what I should do

501
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:28,130
but nobody else has to live with the consequences.

502
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:30,050
You made your choice

503
00:23:30,130 --> 00:23:33,530
and you will let me make mine.

504
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,140
Oh, we have to stop meeting like this.

505
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:45,900
I have something to tell you.

506
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:49,260
Actually, I have something to tell you.

507
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:54,490
I liked playing house with you today.

508
00:23:54,490 --> 00:24:00,160
And I know that this thing between us is new.

509
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,680
And that neither one of us

510
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:06,920
knows what it is or whether it's right

511
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,690
but I'd like to see what it can be.

512
00:24:11,820 --> 00:24:16,190
No guarantees, just possibility.

513
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,620
- I left Eric. - Because of me?

514
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:21,450
Oh, don't flatter yourself. No.

515
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,290
Eric and I were wrong.

516
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:25,370
We've always been wrong.

517
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:30,460
Being with you just showed me how much.

518
00:24:33,130 --> 00:24:35,280
How's Eric taking it?

519
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,180
He offered to move out, but honestly that feels wrong too.

520
00:24:46,690 --> 00:24:48,560
Are you asking me to move in?

521
00:24:48,650 --> 00:24:50,980
Don't flatter yourself.

522
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:53,390
You can crash there as long as you need.

523
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:55,560
I'll bunk with Rachel until my house is ready.

524
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,560
Yeah, unless Eric is bunking with her.

525
00:25:12,460 --> 00:25:13,840
To possibility.

526
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:17,430
Okay.

527
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:27,350
You and Ginger seem friendly.

528
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:30,010
If I were you, I'd steer clear of the Monreaux family.

529
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,930
Isn't your sister married to Eric Monreaux?

530
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:34,770
Well, not for long.

531
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:36,510
Eric is cheating on his pregnant wife.

532
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:39,010
He bragged about it in front of her today.

533
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,680
That boy's becoming his father.

534
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:49,100
That is evidence of corruption in the Monreaux family

535
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,600
for over a decade.

536
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:53,920
And that's just a taste. I have access to more.

537
00:25:55,050 --> 00:25:56,700
Why are you sharing this with me?

538
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:00,220
My conscious won't allow me to be part of this anymore.

539
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:03,960
Margaret, she named her son CEO to cover all this up.

540
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:07,730
There is a cancer growing on our company.

541
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:12,650
Eugene's pilot.

542
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:17,140
God has a plan for all of us.

543
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:18,980
At least he died doing what he loved

544
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:21,800
in the bosom of Jesus.

545
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:22,980
Oh, dear Lord

546
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:26,290
Margaret Monreaux is hosting a cage fight.

547
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:31,160
Who I'm sleeping with is none of your business.

548
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:33,230
Rose, I was only trying to help.

549
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:34,550
You betrayed my trust.

550
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,330
Don't be an unwed mother like my mother was.

551
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:40,500
That is such a crock.

552
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:44,430
This is all about you and your stupid image.

553
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:47,080
Rose, I don't want you

554
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,680
to do something that you will regret forever.

555
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:52,010
I stopped thinking like you a long time ago.

556
00:26:52,130 --> 00:26:53,760
I was just afraid to tell you.

557
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:56,420
Afraid? Afraid of telling me?

558
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,760
I was afraid if I disagreed with you

559
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:00,320
that you would reject me.

560
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:03,930
I'm going to New York

561
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,840
and I'm gonna take care of this.

562
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:09,460
You think carefully because if you go to New York City

563
00:27:09,620 --> 00:27:12,580
the Lord and I may not forgive you.

564
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:17,610
You can't even say the word, can you, Mama?

565
00:27:17,630 --> 00:27:20,020
It's called an abortion.

566
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:21,800
This early, it is not a child.

567
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,540
I don't know, maybe one day it would be

568
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:25,720
maybe it wouldn't.

569
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:29,220
But I am your child.

570
00:27:29,330 --> 00:27:33,290
And if going to New York means that you can't love me anymore

571
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,690
then was it ever love?

572
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:49,890
Becky?

573
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:52,670
What, you're not staying for the big fight?

574
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:54,980
All that violence I think would send me into labor.

575
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,390
You?

576
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:58,080
I have a big story to write.

577
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,990
Is that why you were in with my brother?

578
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:03,750
You know, you don't need to play dumb.

579
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:05,570
You're a survivor

580
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:08,350
parachuting out in the nick of time.

581
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,910
I don't know what you're talking about.

582
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:13,260
Divorcing Eric Monreaux before everything goes to hell.

583
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:16,840
My guess is that you'll survive them all.

584
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,420
Can I give you a lift home?

585
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,190
No, thank you. I'm going to Ginger's.

586
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,920
This is the final hour

587
00:28:25,930 --> 00:28:29,520
and as you have heard, the Antichrist is coming

588
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:34,870
even now many antichrists have come.

589
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:39,960
This is how we know it's the final hour.

590
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:49,130
She and I are actually a lot alike in some ways.

591
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:50,390
You and Margaret?

592
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:53,890
And I wanna be...

593
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:59,290
as fierce of a mother as she is.

594
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,820
When the time is right.

595
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,400
And this isn't it.

596
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,620
We'll go to New York tomorrow.

597
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,000
Tonight.

598
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,490
Before I change my mind.

599
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:28,340
I just came to wish you luck.

600
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:30,150
Thank you.

601
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,170
I know this is a lot for you.

602
00:29:32,290 --> 00:29:34,840
You've trained your whole life for this moment, Antonio

603
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,750
and I trust God will protect you.

604
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:40,180
I wish I had the faith that you have.

605
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,610
It's like I have, um

606
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,300
a battle raging inside my head

607
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,950
filled up with voices that aren't mine.

608
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:52,950
You have to allow God's voice to come to you.

609
00:29:53,070 --> 00:29:55,860
The rest   that's just noise.

610
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,870
You be our Warrior for Christ.

611
00:30:05,990 --> 00:30:07,870
Margaret, you're not supposed to be here.

612
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:09,120
Now...

613
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,380
He's gotta keep his head straight.

614
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:11,860
From Queens, New York...

615
00:30:11,890 --> 00:30:13,050
I'm leaving.

616
00:30:13,160 --> 00:30:15,460
All on a single blemish

617
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,220
the Warrior for Christ

618
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:21,720
Antonio Rivera!

619
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,710
What was she saying to you?

620
00:30:23,710 --> 00:30:25,150
Nothing.

621
00:30:25,270 --> 00:30:27,390
It may not seem like it right now, but you're my number one.

622
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:28,700
You know that right?

623
00:30:30,830 --> 00:30:32,400
The Warrior for Christ is gonna need

624
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:33,900
a wing and a prayer to win it.

625
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:36,400
Plus, it's time to...

626
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:37,890
Rachel, it's time.

627
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:39,310
Put up or...

628
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,000
Place all 6 million.

629
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,920
Shut up!

630
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:51,340
Ladies and gentlemen!

631
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:53,420
The wait is over!

632
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:55,760
Tonight's the night!

633
00:30:55,830 --> 00:30:59,240
Everything is on the line!

634
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:03,020
This moment will define these two fighters.

635
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,430
Warriors

636
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:08,360
is your kingdom ready

637
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,920
for battle?

638
00:31:10,950 --> 00:31:12,870
Rivera really is like

639
00:31:13,030 --> 00:31:14,870
Daniel in the lions' den.

640
00:31:21,730 --> 00:31:23,280
Lord forgive us.

641
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:30,620
You guys ready? Let's fight.

642
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:40,130
Back and forth battle, Chucky.

643
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,060
Yep, Rivera seems  to have the edge on his feet.

644
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:44,710
That's my boy.

645
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:47,050
Yopi raised him to be a champion.

646
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:50,400
Reverend Thomas paid your pilot to take a dive.

647
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,550
Paul made a miracle ten years ago,

648
00:31:52,570 --> 00:31:54,060
but he couldn't do it again.

649
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,720
Your "pilot error" was really a suicide mission.

650
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:58,150
He was going to die anyway.

651
00:31:58,270 --> 00:31:59,560
Seesaw battle.

652
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,150
The fans are getting  their money's worth.

653
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:03,990
There's something for you in the printer.

654
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,660
It's electric  here in the cage...

655
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,590
Nobody changed the password.

656
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,160
I called up bank statements

657
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,920
from all my shell companies.

658
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:15,490
Transactions right up to the day I died.

659
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:18,430
I treated my life like a balance sheet.

660
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:22,430
Sins on one side, good works on the other.

661
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:25,250
Never could make 'em add up, though.

662
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,090
I lied to Tina.

663
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:31,090
I knew they had sent Hagamond Sheen after her.

664
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:35,950
I knew that they sent him to break Yopi's hands.

665
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,510
I told myself I was a victim too.

666
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:43,290
I could've gone to the police.

667
00:32:43,410 --> 00:32:46,750
Problem was, I liked being rich.

668
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:56,130
You know, this is probably the last chance

669
00:32:56,290 --> 00:32:58,200
that you'll have to talk to Ginger

670
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,850
before the story breaks and everything changes.

671
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:05,630
Do you want me to call her and have her come here?

672
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,560
It seems Rivera  is edging power to The Bear.

673
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,310
Smart money must be feeling  pretty safe...

674
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,970
What's that for?

675
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:22,550
There's a flower shop a few blocks away.

676
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,830
You can't meet your daughter empty-handed.

677
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,650
The man lost  two pounds in 45 minutes.

678
00:33:29,670 --> 00:33:31,170
He's gonna be weakened  by that.

679
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,180
Hey, angel.

680
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,060
- I'm on my way. - It's Becky.

681
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,910
Hey.

682
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,760
I knew Paul was taking this too well.

683
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,690
If we're not married, you're expendable.

684
00:33:50,810 --> 00:33:52,430
What are you talking about?

685
00:33:52,510 --> 00:33:54,270
Paul was talking to that reporter about Eugene.

686
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,400
Eric, I think he's setting you and Margaret up.

687
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,280
- Eric? - Thank you.

688
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,790
You're a good person, Eric.

689
00:34:05,370 --> 00:34:08,250
I'm sorry for everything.

690
00:34:13,590 --> 00:34:15,880
It's like playing  chess with chainsaws, Jack.

691
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:20,610
Oh! And it's a swing  and a miss by Rivera.

692
00:34:20,610 --> 00:34:22,640
We can feel the breeze from here.

693
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:25,800
Mind if I sit here?

694
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,230
I was saving it for Margaret.

695
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:28,940
I'll keep it warm for her.

696
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,130
Ever since I've known that man,

697
00:34:35,150 --> 00:34:37,070
he's been waiting for Margaret.

698
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,390
You know, I think it's cruel to let someone live

699
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,820
a fantasy like that.

700
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,990
- You want a drink? - Sure, baby.

701
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,590
He's got him  against the cage.

702
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,830
And takedown!

703
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:56,420
He's doing good.

704
00:34:56,540 --> 00:34:58,830
Takedown right  into the ground and pound.

705
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:01,820
Chechen Bear draws  first blood.

706
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,650
Rivera, defend yourself or I'm gonna stop the fight!

707
00:35:04,660 --> 00:35:07,250
This could be the end.

708
00:35:07,270 --> 00:35:08,680
I thought about your offer.

709
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,680
Blackmail is not really my jam.

710
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:13,440
Well, that leaves me no choice but to tell your sugar mama

711
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,090
all about Mark.

712
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,190
Mark can speak for himself.

713
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:25,360
I'd like to report an assault in progress

714
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:27,600
at the Sunshine Studios.

715
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:29,810
Yes, I do.

716
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:31,960
His name is Mark Conley.

717
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:36,590
Oh, hey, Brett.

718
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:40,950
Forget Cain and Abel.

719
00:35:40,970 --> 00:35:42,470
We've got Rivera and Deela  right here

720
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:43,470
- in New Orleans... - Security!

721
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:45,030
For a hell of a--

722
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,790
- I shouldn't say hell, Jack. - Hey, hey, get off man!

723
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:49,200
And that's the bell

724
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,870
ending round one.

725
00:35:50,870 --> 00:35:53,720
And Rivera survives round one, "bearly,"

726
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:56,390
Chechen Bear-ly.

727
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,650
Oh,  I don't know if I can take

728
00:35:57,770 --> 00:36:00,560
any more of your punishment.

729
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:02,800
Round two!

730
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,140
It's Ginger,  leave a message.

731
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,230
Hey, it's me.

732
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:06,490
You need to come over after the fight.

733
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:08,720
I have some really big news about your dad,

734
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:11,160
and what happened to him.

735
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:13,040
See you soon.

736
00:36:14,330 --> 00:36:16,540
You're not gonna believe this one.

737
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,730
I'm gonna submit you now.

738
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:44,770
Tap. Tap, bitch.

739
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:47,420
He's got him in an armlock.

740
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,530
If Rivera doesn't tap out, he's gonna lose that arm.

741
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,700
It's gonna snap right off.

742
00:36:53,370 --> 00:36:57,120
Lord, how can I protect my children from themselves

743
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,710
and still set them free?

744
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:02,790
Freedom is a dark wood.

745
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,630
We take the wrong path,  we get lost.

746
00:37:05,720 --> 00:37:08,240
We stumble and fall, Lord,

747
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:10,800
and disappoint the ones  we love.

748
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:14,780
Give me peace.

749
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:18,970
Give us strength to love  our family.

750
00:37:19,090 --> 00:37:22,380
Not for whom  we wish them to be,

751
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,110
but for who they are.

752
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,220
Give us strength to do  the impossible.

753
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,650
Oh, whoa, whoa,  whoa, what's going on?

754
00:37:33,750 --> 00:37:35,320
I've never seen  a reverse like that.

755
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,820
I'll snap your arm.

756
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:38,920
Snap it, homie.

757
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,670
What's he doing?

758
00:37:49,820 --> 00:37:52,660
- We're going for real? - For real, homie!

759
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:54,490
The longshot ain't dead yet.

760
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:57,690
It won't be easy work for Deela after all.

761
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:04,090
Suddenly smart money  don't look so smart.

762
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:05,840
It's moments like this

763
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,820
when a man's true nature  is revealed.

764
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:17,120
Wait for me.

765
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,370
To be continued.

766
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,960
Hands too burnt

767
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,540
Sitting on the side  of the road

768
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:28,970
Ain't got an honest feeling  in my bones

769
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:32,550
Felt like a fever

770
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,880
- * Came on like a stone * - I'm sorry, Ma.

771
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,980
You apologize for nothing! Do you hear me?

772
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:43,130
Get up, up, up,  up, up, up, up

773
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:45,890
If you want my,  want my, want my, love

774
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:48,150
Get up, up, up,  up, up, up, up

775
00:38:48,310 --> 00:38:51,160
If you want my,  want my love

776
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:53,400
Fire

777
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:59,150
Fire

778
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,360
I'm calling the police.

779
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:06,150
Bless my soul,  that's the way it is

780
00:39:06,170 --> 00:39:08,250
We have to bring about the birth pangs

781
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:09,990
of a new world.

782
00:39:13,370 --> 00:39:14,750
Deela is down!

783
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:17,000
Improbable turn of events here in New Orleans.

784
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,830
Did you say improbable,  Chucky?

785
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,590
He's out! Rivera wins!

786
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:22,670
Some would call  it a miracle, Jack.

787
00:39:22,690 --> 00:39:25,080
Swift as a river

788
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:28,340
With a head  as hard as stone

789
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:31,740
What's hot as hell the same, won't leave you cold

790
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,180
I'm sorry, Mama.

791
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,350
You think I don't know you?

792
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:39,200
After I saw you talking to that white lady?

793
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,190
I bet everything on you.

794
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,540
We quadrupled our money.

795
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:45,450
- You understand? - Yeah.

796
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,790
- We quadrupled our money. - What about Don Bouchard?

797
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,460
We got him right where we want him.

798
00:39:49,570 --> 00:39:51,380
Now we can afford to have a fair fight.

799
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,390
We can afford to have a fair fight.

800
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,970
Mommy's got to take care of some business.

801
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,470
I gotta make another move. One more move.

802
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,880
- Get your belt, baby. - On your feet, champ.

803
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,140
Bless my soul,  that's the way it is

804
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:11,290
Let's get that belt.

805
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:13,860
Bless my soul,  I can't resist

806
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,740
Ladies, it'll be  a short 2 1/2 hour flight

807
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,990
to New York City.

808
00:40:20,080 --> 00:40:21,230
Get comfortable  and we'll get you

809
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:22,320
safely to your destination.

810
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,990
Oh, I forgot all about him.

811
00:40:24,110 --> 00:40:25,320
Hey, it's me.

812
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,830
You need to come over  after the fight.

813
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:28,660
I have some really big news  about your dad,

814
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,760
and what happened.

815
00:40:30,870 --> 00:40:33,740
Okay, see you soon.

816
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,890
Do you need to call him back?

817
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:38,600
It can wait.

818
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,270
Wait.

819
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:43,310
- Wait! - Mama?

820
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,020
What are you doing here?

821
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:49,260
Sweetie, I don't agree with your decision.

822
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:52,110
But, sweetie, I am here.

823
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:53,500
You are my daughter

824
00:40:53,510 --> 00:40:55,860
and there is nothing more important than you.

825
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,860
Thank you.

826
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:25,550
Your daddy won.

827
00:41:25,670 --> 00:41:28,480
When you wake up, he'll be here.

828
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,830
I started to think you weren't coming.

829
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:47,410
Yeah, I--I, uh, only came to say good-bye.

830
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:48,500
What?

831
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:50,690
You didn't do anything, Rachel.

832
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,580
It's--it's not...

833
00:41:52,700 --> 00:41:54,990
It's all my fault.

834
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:57,510
I'm trapped.

835
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:02,000
I'm trapped, and now I'll never be free.

836
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:06,520
Oh, Eric.

837
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,190
Fire

838
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,270
Fire

839
00:42:17,700 --> 00:42:20,010
Keep walking, pal. Keep walking.

840
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:24,780
Bless my soul,  I can't resist

841
00:42:24,850 --> 00:42:26,930
Help...

842
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,610
Did you hear that?

843
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,930
I'm gonna check on Jesus.

844
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,940
With a head as hard  as stone

845
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:38,760
What's hot as hell the same, won't leave you cold

846
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:42,280
I'm a believer

847
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,390
Help...

848
00:42:44,510 --> 00:42:46,390
- Help! - Becky?

849
00:42:46,550 --> 00:42:50,560
Walkin' a fine line, might not need to go

850
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,290
Fire

851
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,900
The baby's coming.

852
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,480
Call 911!

853
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:04,060
Bless my soul,  that's the way it is

854
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:10,750
Bless my soul,  I can't resist
