1
00:00:55,083 --> 00:00:58,292
She is my only child,

2
00:00:58,292 --> 00:00:59,958
Her mother passed away early.

3
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:03,208
She has suffered a lot with me.

4
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:09,042
That's enough money for you to raise her.

5
00:01:09,792 --> 00:01:15,083
For the sake of 20 years of friendship, please.

6
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:30,000
Don't worry,
I'll treat her like my birth daughter.

7
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,292
Xiao Ju.

8
00:04:57,667 --> 00:05:05,958
"The Lonely Spirit In An Old Building"

9
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:39,958
Cut.

10
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,833
Director, is it good?

11
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:49,167
Good, cameraman, how do you think?

12
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:51,708
OK, good.

13
00:05:51,708 --> 00:05:55,042
Every unit takes a look at this.

14
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,167
Has our lighting crew's work ever been poor?

15
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:59,458
- Makeup has no problem.
- Alright.

16
00:06:00,542 --> 00:06:01,625
Alright.

17
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,833
Good, it's done.

18
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:13,417
Director, the sound isn't good enough.

19
00:06:13,417 --> 00:06:14,750
What's wrong?

20
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:18,625
- Come on, girl, take a rest.
- Yu Hong.

21
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:20,583
The stair sound is wrong,

22
00:06:20,792 --> 00:06:23,458
could you ask set decorator to enhance it?

23
00:06:24,292 --> 00:06:26,083
More specific.

24
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:31,625
I suggest adding a layer of pallets

25
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,333
I suggest to improve the thickness of the floor.

26
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:38,292
- It's not easy.
- The budget is only 700 thousands.

27
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,375
Where do you get that much money?

28
00:06:42,708 --> 00:06:44,083
Then you tell me.

29
00:06:51,417 --> 00:06:55,500
Forget it. We won't record the scene
at the same time.

30
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,292
You guys find a place to do some motion effects.

31
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,375
- Alright.
- Yu Hong!

32
00:07:00,375 --> 00:07:02,667
_ Yu Hong!
<i>'</i> Yes?

33
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:07,458
- Treats on you after shooting.
- Okay, no problem.

34
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,833
- The ratio is one to three...
- Only a bottle of soda.

35
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,167
Just change the script as I said.

36
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:12,542
Don't forget to fill the film.

37
00:07:12,542 --> 00:07:15,750
It's not working now. Listen to me.

38
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,958
Don't always show off yourself, okay?

39
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,333
As if you really have some kind of
supernatural power.

40
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:23,250
Go and make up some sound after the scene today.

41
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:25,625
The ones we recorded just now don't work at all.

42
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:30,000
Huo Feng, finish the recording before
you do anything else, take it easy.

43
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:33,542
Director, you try too hard, don't you?

44
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:07,000
Take care. We'll go to your house
for a wedding reception tomorrow.

45
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:16,833
Bye bye, assholes.

46
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,208
Director Li.

47
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:22,708
The building is almost empty,

48
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:26,250
I'll help you whenever you need.

49
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:27,458
What director?

50
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:33,292
I have no one or no car to help me,
How can I move?

51
00:08:33,292 --> 00:08:35,708
Talk to the head of your unit.

52
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:40,583
Before I retired,
I got a raise in salary and a guarantee.

53
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:43,667
But now? Damn it!

54
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:46,917
What about your son?

55
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:50,542
Forget it, he is ungrateful.

56
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:53,542
He's been abroad for over a year,
and he doesn't even send me a letter.

57
00:08:55,292 --> 00:08:57,917
Look at you, you are angrier than I am.

58
00:08:57,917 --> 00:09:01,542
I'll talk to the leader tomorrow.

59
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:06,000
No one wants to live in this crappy building.

60
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,083
You Fei.

61
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:11,958
Listen, hurry up!

62
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,083
You Fei.

63
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,958
You Fei.

64
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,208
Wait.

65
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,458
Oh, it's you, Master Fang.

66
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,500
Why haven't you moved yet?

67
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,333
I've urged you for hundreds of times.

68
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:30,792
Yes, you have a good memory. What will I get?

69
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,958
Didn't we agree? Two-bedroom apartment.

70
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:39,167
We have made a deal too.
Not moving without a three-bedroom apartment.

71
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:46,792
You live alone, this is already enough for you.

72
00:09:46,792 --> 00:09:50,333
Cut the crap, I won't move.

73
00:09:50,417 --> 00:09:52,208
I won't chicken out.

74
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:59,083
By tomorrow the building will be empty,
it'll be all mine.

75
00:10:00,042 --> 00:10:01,167
How about that?

76
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,708
What kind of people live in this building?

77
00:10:27,167 --> 00:10:28,458
Thank you.

78
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,125
Huo Feng, I'm telling you.

79
00:10:37,417 --> 00:10:40,292
You're one of the three families
who stuck in this building.

80
00:10:43,375 --> 00:10:48,708
What's wrong with you today?
I'm disappointed about your attitude.

81
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:50,833
Disappointed?

82
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:53,750
You won't feel that if you were mine.

83
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:55,667
Speak! When will you move?

84
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,083
After two weeks.

85
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:01,083
I'm busy making a movie now, don't have time.

86
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,208
When the time comes, I'll help Lin move.

87
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:07,375
You film makers only know how to educate others.

88
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,583
When it's your turn, it's not the same thing.

89
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:14,917
Old Li, it's not appropriate
to talk like this, right?

90
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:17,625
If you don't move in two weeks,

91
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:20,125
it's not just inappropriate talking.

92
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:23,708
People like you deserve some tough measures.

93
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,833
What an asshole, let's go.

94
00:11:56,042 --> 00:12:00,167
What's wrong? Start again.

95
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:03,333
Footsteps, take two.

96
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:09,208
Ready,acHon.

97
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:20,042
Why do you keep wandering off?

98
00:12:20,042 --> 00:12:23,292
I feel like someone's staring at me.

99
00:12:25,208 --> 00:12:27,917
Yes, I'm staring at you.

100
00:12:27,917 --> 00:12:31,292
No, it's a big pair of eyes.

101
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,458
Silly you.

102
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:36,417
Come on, don't be paranoid.

103
00:12:36,792 --> 00:12:39,833
If we don't finish this,
you're gonna have to stay here.

104
00:12:40,542 --> 00:12:42,917
It's nice, though.

105
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:44,667
In your dream.

106
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:47,750
Forget about the dream, let's record again.

107
00:12:49,792 --> 00:12:51,875
Footsteps, take three.

108
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:56,708
<i>Ready, set</i>

109
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:59,625
Yes, I saw it.

110
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,667
A little girl staring at me.

111
00:13:01,667 --> 00:13:03,292
She is in the basement.

112
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,958
I think you are crazy today.

113
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:20,667
Forget it. The first two recordings are enough.

114
00:13:23,667 --> 00:13:26,500
Look, I forget to turn off
the machine when you scream.

115
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,792
Listen.

116
00:13:32,833 --> 00:13:36,125
Damn it, what's wrong?

117
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,667
Don't go there.

118
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,833
It's okay, stay there.

119
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:47,083
Yu Hong, Yu Hong, Yu Hong.

120
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,208
Damn you, who are you scaring?

121
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:04,250
Damn you, who are you scaring?

122
00:19:10,792 --> 00:19:13,500
- Did you go down to the basement.
- What?

123
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:17,500
You've got a lot of guts.
It's been locked up for over 10 years.

124
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,875
Who opened it?

125
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:23,167
I don't know. I was recording,

126
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:27,208
then I heard something
so I went down to check it out.

127
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:34,375
Huo Feng, you haven't been here
long enough to know,

128
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:37,042
several people have
committed suicide in this basement.

129
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:39,250
No one dares to go down after that.

130
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:56,333
What's going on? Start again.

131
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,042
Footsteps, take two.

132
00:20:59,292 --> 00:21:02,208
<i>Ready, set</i>

133
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,250
Why do you keep wandering off?

134
00:21:40,292 --> 00:21:43,375
I feel like someone's staring at me.

135
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:46,458
Yeah, I'm staring at you.

136
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:49,042
No, it's a big pair of eyes.

137
00:21:49,042 --> 00:21:50,042
Silly You.

138
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:52,458
Come on, don't be paranoid.

139
00:21:52,458 --> 00:21:55,333
If we don't finish this,
you're gonna have to live here.

140
00:21:56,667 --> 00:21:59,458
It's nice, though.

141
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,625
In your dream.

142
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:03,083
Forget about the dream. Let's record again.

143
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,042

144
00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:07,250
Yes, I saw it.

145
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:10,958
A little girl staring at me.
She's in the basement.

146
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,542
Hello?

147
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:39,000
Hello? Why is your phone always busy?

148
00:23:39,792 --> 00:23:41,250
I haven't used the phone.

149
00:23:41,250 --> 00:23:43,042
Nonsense.

150
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,125
Why do you always lie?

151
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:47,917
You won't believe me anyway.

152
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,833
Why didn't I see you when I came out?

153
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:56,292
After you went in,
I called you a few times but you didn't answer.

154
00:23:56,292 --> 00:23:59,833
I... I felt a little...

155
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:03,458
What? What do you feel?

156
00:24:03,792 --> 00:24:05,667
Did you find anything inside?

157
00:24:06,833 --> 00:24:12,250
No, but I recorded a very strange sound.

158
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:18,667
When you went in,
I felt a man take a little girl...

159
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:20,458
Could you come over right away?

160
00:24:20,458 --> 00:24:23,500
Yes, I'll be right there.

161
00:24:24,042 --> 00:24:25,208
Who is it?

162
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,417
Wait a minute.

163
00:24:37,833 --> 00:24:40,250
What is it, director?

164
00:24:40,667 --> 00:24:42,167
What's wrong with you?

165
00:24:42,625 --> 00:24:44,250
Nothing.

166
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:49,042
I just found a strange thing.

167
00:24:49,042 --> 00:24:50,292
Yes?

168
00:24:51,625 --> 00:24:53,833
Maybe I do have special powers.

169
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:56,833
You're probably too tired these days.

170
00:24:57,167 --> 00:25:01,000
Let's go dance and relax.

171
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:04,000
Okay, I'll go change.

172
00:25:05,625 --> 00:25:07,792
I'll wait for you.

173
00:25:13,042 --> 00:25:19,250
The director wants to see me.
I will meet you later. Bye.

174
00:26:02,542 --> 00:26:06,250
I saw a little girl in the basement.

175
00:26:06,583 --> 00:26:11,625
But the door was sealed. It was weird.

176
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,958
Do you think I'm hallucinating
or seeing a ghost,

177
00:26:14,958 --> 00:26:16,750
or is it supernatural?

178
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:20,292
You can choose to believe in
supernatural powers or not.

179
00:26:20,917 --> 00:26:24,625
Huo Feng is so brave.
He went into the basement by himself.

180
00:26:25,042 --> 00:26:27,083
The basement?

181
00:26:28,208 --> 00:26:30,125
I'm here.

182
00:26:30,625 --> 00:26:31,792
Wait for me.

183
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:38,167
This way.

184
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:51,083
Have you decided?

185
00:26:52,042 --> 00:26:53,292
Sure.

186
00:26:56,542 --> 00:26:57,833
Name a price.

187
00:26:58,042 --> 00:27:00,833
Two thousand. Name a place.

188
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:02,292
Tuan Cheng.

189
00:27:02,292 --> 00:27:05,250
All right, tomorrow at <i>5</i> p.m.

190
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,583
<i>Tomorrow at '5 pm.</i>

191
00:27:07,583 --> 00:27:09,833
- That's right.
- I'll see you there.

192
00:27:09,833 --> 00:27:10,833
Alright.

193
00:29:15,625 --> 00:29:17,750
What are you doing here, young man?

194
00:29:18,292 --> 00:29:21,500
You're really strong, you scared me.

195
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:26,833
You movie maker are crazy.
Looking for inspiration here.

196
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:29,792
I want to record some sound effects
when no one's around.

197
00:29:29,792 --> 00:29:31,542
I don't know your business.

198
00:29:31,542 --> 00:29:34,833
But why are you recording when there is no sound?

199
00:29:34,833 --> 00:29:36,542
That's true,

200
00:29:37,208 --> 00:29:41,500
but I always thought there was
something wrong with this building.

201
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,750
That's right. I couldn't open the bathroom door

202
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:47,958
this afternoon.

203
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:49,833
The TV was also out of order.

204
00:29:49,833 --> 00:29:52,500
Come on, let's take a look.

205
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:53,958
Sure.

206
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:19,167
Nothing's wrong with it.

207
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:21,250
This is really strange.

208
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:24,833
How come when I turn it on,
the picture doesn't come out?

209
00:30:25,458 --> 00:30:26,333
Have one.

210
00:30:30,583 --> 00:30:33,542
Come on, take a look at the lock.

211
00:30:40,125 --> 00:30:41,417
See?

212
00:30:47,583 --> 00:30:50,833
Maybe the rotor is broken. You are moving anyway.

213
00:30:50,833 --> 00:30:52,917
I'll help you move later.

214
00:30:52,917 --> 00:30:56,000
Let's use the toilet across the hall
for the next two days.

215
00:30:56,500 --> 00:30:59,458
Don't mention moving.
Even if you can help me move,

216
00:30:59,458 --> 00:31:03,167
I have no energy to do the cleaning in the future.

217
00:31:03,167 --> 00:31:06,958
Besides, the new building is low and suffocating.

218
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,042
It's fine now, isn't it?

219
00:31:14,333 --> 00:31:16,583
You're very attached to this building.

220
00:31:17,042 --> 00:31:19,833
Of course, I've lived here for decades.

221
00:31:20,125 --> 00:31:21,625
You've been living in this room?

222
00:31:21,625 --> 00:31:23,750
I used to live in the basement.

223
00:31:25,042 --> 00:31:30,833
The basement? I heard that a few people
committed suicide there.

224
00:31:32,833 --> 00:31:36,167
It was a little girl named Xiao Ju.

225
00:31:36,667 --> 00:31:39,958
She was only 14 years old
when she committed suicide.

226
00:31:42,833 --> 00:31:46,250
Why would such a young girl
wants to commit suicide?

227
00:31:47,625 --> 00:31:50,208
We'll have to ask the king of hell.

228
00:32:05,167 --> 00:32:06,833
What about her parents?

229
00:32:06,958 --> 00:32:09,125
Her mother committed suicide by
jumping off a building.

230
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:10,833
For what?

231
00:32:10,833 --> 00:32:15,208
How would I know?
You don't have much options in those days.

232
00:32:16,208 --> 00:32:19,750
You were in charge at that time?
You must have known the truth.

233
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:21,500
Charge for what?

234
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,958
Those were the days of class struggle.

235
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,458
It was difficult when I was just promoted

236
00:32:25,458 --> 00:32:27,750
to the deputy director of the Revolution Office.

237
00:32:45,708 --> 00:32:49,500
About this room, it was...

238
00:33:07,833 --> 00:33:12,583
As soon as I came back,
both father and daughter were dead.

239
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:16,333
Please come in.

240
00:33:17,583 --> 00:33:19,208
Who are you talking to?

241
00:33:20,583 --> 00:33:22,250
Someone knocked on the door.

242
00:33:23,083 --> 00:33:24,583
Why didn't I hear it?

243
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:35,042
Oh, I misheard.

244
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,708
We all make mistakes sometimes.

245
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,292
Listen.

246
00:34:06,833 --> 00:34:10,125
I thought it was you!

247
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:11,917
- Since you are here.
- Let me introduce you to each other.

248
00:34:11,958 --> 00:34:13,792
This is actress Yu Hong.

249
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:15,333
- This is Old Lin.
- How are you?

250
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:18,500
You are commonly seen in movies.

251
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:20,375
Let's sit inside.

252
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,833
Go inside.

253
00:34:22,458 --> 00:34:25,000
I've been watching your movies a lot.

254
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,375
It's as simple as that.

255
00:34:42,458 --> 00:34:46,000
Sounds simple. We're talking about the old days.

256
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:49,417
It's okay, you guys keep talking.

257
00:34:50,083 --> 00:34:52,417
After Old Li was in jail

258
00:34:52,417 --> 00:34:55,125
it's been a hard time for her wife and daughter.

259
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:57,625
A lot of people came after them.

260
00:34:58,667 --> 00:35:00,792
Her mother came to beg me.

261
00:35:01,542 --> 00:35:05,000
She asked me to save Old Li and them

262
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:08,333
that for the sake of colleagues for decades.

263
00:35:09,042 --> 00:35:12,708
But I was also in a hard time...

264
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,667
She was fine when her mother passed away.

265
00:35:35,083 --> 00:35:38,417
I never thought she would not be able to survive.

266
00:35:40,542 --> 00:35:43,250
The country was crazy, not to mention people.

267
00:35:51,792 --> 00:35:54,708
Yu Hong, Yu Hong.

268
00:36:34,917 --> 00:36:41,083
Huo Feng! Huo Feng, help!

269
00:37:54,167 --> 00:37:58,375
Why is there a problem again?

270
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:08,417
Who?

271
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,125
Who?

272
00:39:26,125 --> 00:39:31,125
Huo Feng, Huo Feng, help me!

273
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:34,833
Huo Feng, Huo Feng...

274
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:49,125
Help!

275
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:08,583
Huo Feng, help!

276
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:15,917
Old Lin, Old Lin.

277
00:40:28,792 --> 00:40:30,167
Old Lin.

278
00:40:55,542 --> 00:40:56,667
Old Lin.

279
00:41:25,958 --> 00:41:27,250
Old Lin.

280
00:41:36,458 --> 00:41:37,958
Old Lin.

281
00:41:39,333 --> 00:41:40,833
Where are you?

282
00:41:44,125 --> 00:41:47,250
What the hell are you doing?

283
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:50,042
Did you hear Lao Lin cry for help?
He seems to have been beaten up.

284
00:41:50,042 --> 00:41:52,042
I think you deserve a beating.

285
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:53,875
Go!

286
00:42:13,042 --> 00:42:16,750
The dark doorway always attracts my attention.

287
00:42:17,292 --> 00:42:20,833
- I saw it.
- What?

288
00:42:21,125 --> 00:42:24,833
A man hanged a little girl.

289
00:42:25,167 --> 00:42:29,375
I saw him raping her in Old Lin's home.

290
00:42:29,375 --> 00:42:31,875
Wait, did you see it clearly?

291
00:42:31,875 --> 00:42:36,333
Yes, I was really scared.

292
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,583
Do you think it's possible?

293
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:45,375
Firstly you confused me,
and then you left without saying goodbye.

294
00:42:45,875 --> 00:42:49,375
But the strangest thing to me
was the process of Lin's death.

295
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:52,250
I recorded it a few hours before he died.

296
00:42:53,833 --> 00:42:55,500
That's it...

297
00:42:56,333 --> 00:42:58,167
a bad omen.

298
00:42:59,375 --> 00:43:01,000
What else did you feel?

299
00:43:01,917 --> 00:43:03,375
Revenge.

300
00:43:04,042 --> 00:43:05,917
- Revenge?
- Yes.

301
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,625
Who?

302
00:43:08,458 --> 00:43:14,250
A wronged spirit, the one born from the murder.

303
00:43:16,458 --> 00:43:20,667
Was it Xiao Ju?
Are you saying that Old Lin killed her?

304
00:43:20,667 --> 00:43:26,042
Huo Feng, I really don't want to
mention this now, I am scared.

305
00:43:26,750 --> 00:43:29,000
It's fine, I got you.

306
00:43:29,042 --> 00:43:31,667
You should move out of the building quickly.

307
00:43:31,667 --> 00:43:33,750
I want to get to the bottom of this weird thing.

308
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:36,583
Even if it's true, it's been more than ten years.

309
00:43:36,583 --> 00:43:39,583
Besides, Old Lin is already dead.

310
00:43:39,583 --> 00:43:41,167
I always think something else is going to happen.

311
00:43:41,167 --> 00:43:45,000
There seems to be a force that attracts me to
find out what's going on.

312
00:43:53,875 --> 00:43:58,833
You're right on time, well done.

313
00:43:59,625 --> 00:44:02,292
I'm serious. Take a look.

314
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,208
Here you go.

315
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:16,792
This is real.

316
00:44:21,750 --> 00:44:23,042
How is it?

317
00:44:23,792 --> 00:44:25,792
Rolled gold of Ming Dynasty.

318
00:44:26,417 --> 00:44:28,667
Two thousands, take a count.

319
00:44:30,417 --> 00:44:32,917
You count, I'll watch it.

320
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:10,125
Two thousands in total.

321
00:45:16,875 --> 00:45:20,167
I'll bring you the lotus bowl
from the Song Dynasty tomorrow.

322
00:45:20,167 --> 00:45:22,792
- I'll take all the real ones.
- Okay.

323
00:45:23,958 --> 00:45:25,708
I don't want the broken ones.

324
00:45:25,708 --> 00:45:28,375
Don't worry, it'll be fine.

325
00:45:30,917 --> 00:45:32,250
Action!

326
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:35,667
Go, keep going, keep going. Right, go.

327
00:45:35,667 --> 00:45:39,042
Looking for something, yes. Go, go, go.

328
00:45:39,417 --> 00:45:40,500
Cut.

329
00:45:43,792 --> 00:45:45,125
How is it?

330
00:45:46,542 --> 00:45:47,750
Look.

331
00:45:48,292 --> 00:45:49,292
What did you say?

332
00:45:49,292 --> 00:45:52,250
The act is too bad. You go and talk to her.

333
00:45:52,250 --> 00:45:54,125
Come... put it on.

334
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,083
Do you know what you are looking for?

335
00:45:58,208 --> 00:46:01,792
This is a precious key your father
left behind for you,

336
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:04,417
This is a relic.

337
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:07,250
Not to pick up purses.

338
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:11,292
Fix her makeup, I said fix her makeup.

339
00:46:14,250 --> 00:46:17,917
I said let's do the next shot, right?

340
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,125
Producer?

341
00:46:20,708 --> 00:46:21,792
Where is Huo Feng?

342
00:46:22,458 --> 00:46:23,833
He is not here.

343
00:46:24,542 --> 00:46:25,958
Go find him.

344
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:27,917
I want to ask about something.

345
00:46:28,417 --> 00:46:31,167
How did the girl named Xiao Ju

346
00:46:31,167 --> 00:46:34,083
in the basement of Building 13 die?

347
00:46:34,083 --> 00:46:37,250
Why are you asking about her after all this time?

348
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:41,125
I want to write a movie script
about the Cultural Revolution.

349
00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:43,833
I was there at that time.

350
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:46,208
How can I put it?

351
00:46:47,708 --> 00:46:50,750
From the scene,
it doesn't appear to be a case of murder.

352
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:55,833
But the key around the victim's neck was
hanging out of the rope.

353
00:46:57,292 --> 00:47:00,667
There were suicides every day in those days.

354
00:47:00,667 --> 00:47:02,583
Why didn't you investigate at that time?

355
00:47:03,333 --> 00:47:05,750
The Police the procuratorate
and the law department

356
00:47:05,750 --> 00:47:08,417
were smashed at that time. Who cares?

357
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:11,000
We just want to close the case.

358
00:47:13,167 --> 00:47:15,667
Be careful and quickly load the car.

359
00:47:15,667 --> 00:47:17,542
Finish this scene and go back for dinner.

360
00:47:17,542 --> 00:47:20,625
Director, Huo Feng is not here,
people say he went out for business.

361
00:47:21,417 --> 00:47:27,375
Damn, if this scene can't use actual recording.
Let's go back.

362
00:47:27,375 --> 00:47:29,792
- Let's go.
- Be careful..

363
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:39,000
Please go.

364
00:47:40,125 --> 00:47:42,458
Is that golden Buddha wanted by the upper class?

365
00:47:42,458 --> 00:47:46,042
Right. They asked for this.

366
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:50,333
You really don't know how the girl died?

367
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:53,833
If I really knew the truth,

368
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:57,333
how could I not to tell you?

369
00:47:59,833 --> 00:48:01,000
This way.

370
00:48:01,833 --> 00:48:03,833
- Dad.
- Cut.

371
00:48:04,042 --> 00:48:05,750
This is not good.

372
00:48:07,833 --> 00:48:10,417
As the adopted daughter of this family,

373
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:13,500
you don't want to accept your foster

374
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:15,750
father's money and the opportunity to go abroad.

375
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:20,167
In order for your foster father's
biological daughter to go abroad,

376
00:48:20,542 --> 00:48:25,292
Tonight you are going to leave the house quietly

377
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:29,000
and not to let your foster father know.

378
00:48:31,083 --> 00:48:36,625
You should not act from your look nor the body.

379
00:48:36,667 --> 00:48:38,458
It's all about...

380
00:48:38,458 --> 00:48:40,542
<i>---Your eyes.</i>

381
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:43,125
You need to express the complex emotion

382
00:48:43,125 --> 00:48:46,917
in your eyes to your foster father.

383
00:48:46,958 --> 00:48:50,083
Director, I'm afraid I can't do it.

384
00:48:54,042 --> 00:48:56,417
- Roll back.
- Alright.

385
00:48:57,917 --> 00:49:02,458
Yu Hong, you're going to be a super star in China.

386
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,500
I have one more thing to tell you.

387
00:49:07,250 --> 00:49:10,833
This film will be shown on
the international film festival.

388
00:49:11,625 --> 00:49:14,083
You may become an international star.

389
00:49:15,542 --> 00:49:19,333
You know I never asked for anything from you.

390
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:22,292
- How do you feel right now?
- I...

391
00:49:23,917 --> 00:49:27,958
Don't use words, just look into my eyes.

392
00:49:28,292 --> 00:49:33,833
Look at me. Action!

393
00:50:19,625 --> 00:50:22,000
Yu Hong. Yu Hong.

394
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,833
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with her?

395
00:50:23,833 --> 00:50:24,917
My head is dizzy.

396
00:50:24,917 --> 00:50:27,083
You did a good job just now.

397
00:50:27,375 --> 00:50:29,292
Quick, take a rest over here.

398
00:50:29,292 --> 00:50:32,417
Sir, please take a rest, too.

399
00:50:32,417 --> 00:50:33,458
Please rest for a while.

400
00:50:33,458 --> 00:50:37,250
Please sit here. Right, take a break.

401
00:50:38,958 --> 00:50:41,167
- Makeup! Costume!
- Director! Director!

402
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:43,083
- I have something to tell you.
- What?

403
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:46,000
The actor who played Ah'Si is sick,
what should we do?

404
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:47,167
Find another actor.

405
00:50:47,542 --> 00:50:49,542
- We won't make it in time by tomorrow.
- Yu Hong.

406
00:50:49,542 --> 00:50:51,208
- I don't care what happens to you.
- What's wrong?

407
00:50:51,208 --> 00:50:54,375
- That feeling comes back.
- What feeling?

408
00:50:54,375 --> 00:50:55,958
Go over there.

409
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:16,125
Are you okay without Huo Feng?

410
00:51:16,375 --> 00:51:18,625
No problem, you can sit here

411
00:51:24,458 --> 00:51:28,125
- Buddy, the price of TV has gone up again.
- I know.

412
00:51:28,125 --> 00:51:32,500
Listen to me, hurry up and
ask someone for an entitlement.

413
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:47,958
Who? You?

414
00:51:47,958 --> 00:51:50,417
Just that vendor...

415
00:51:51,542 --> 00:51:55,792
That feeling came back
when I looked into his eyes.

416
00:51:56,375 --> 00:52:00,958
He was the one who hanged a little girl.

417
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:06,792
That person, how I feel a bit like the director.

418
00:52:06,792 --> 00:52:12,458
- You mean Zheng Lei?
- A bit similar.

419
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,708
Director, listen to me, this is too difficult.

420
00:52:32,708 --> 00:52:35,167
I don't care if it's difficult or not.

421
00:52:36,458 --> 00:52:40,042
As long as we don't use location recording,
you won't show up.

422
00:52:40,542 --> 00:52:42,458
A man died in our building.

423
00:52:42,833 --> 00:52:44,792
What does this have to do with you?

424
00:52:45,208 --> 00:52:49,250
- I found him.
- You didn't kill him, did you?

425
00:52:49,542 --> 00:52:50,833
How is that possible?

426
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:53,875
I know you're not that smart.

427
00:52:55,208 --> 00:52:57,500
So I can't be a director.

428
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:03,125
I think so. You'll probably never be a director.

429
00:53:03,292 --> 00:53:06,833
Director, please give me one more day.

430
00:53:06,833 --> 00:53:09,375
It's hard to find an actor like Ah'Si.

431
00:53:09,375 --> 00:53:10,625
You need to overcome the difficulty.

432
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:13,458
- Director...
- let me introduce one guy to you.

433
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:15,417
How about the one lives in our building?

434
00:53:16,292 --> 00:53:19,833
- Suitable?
- Perfectly suitable.

435
00:53:19,833 --> 00:53:21,292
How's the acting?

436
00:53:21,958 --> 00:53:28,750
Well, everyone is acting in life.

437
00:53:30,500 --> 00:53:33,292
I think you can be a real director.

438
00:53:35,083 --> 00:53:39,208
- Let me see his picture first.
- Okay.

439
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:50,833
What did you feel after staring at
the director for so long?

440
00:53:50,833 --> 00:53:52,625
Nothing.

441
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:57,708
I think the director is not that kind of person.

442
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,833
- Not a chance.
- Not a chance?

443
00:54:05,542 --> 00:54:10,083
Go back to that place and feel it again.
I'll record it again.

444
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,083
How about it?

445
00:54:43,250 --> 00:54:46,750
No, I can't feel it.

446
00:54:50,708 --> 00:54:54,208
Go inside and listen to see if we get anything.

447
00:54:57,458 --> 00:55:02,417
You just said you felt a person.

448
00:55:04,333 --> 00:55:05,542
Yu Hong.

449
00:55:05,708 --> 00:55:08,833
What did you say?

450
00:55:09,375 --> 00:55:16,583
It seems that there is
a person holding a shiny object.

451
00:55:17,083 --> 00:55:19,083
A shiny object?

452
00:55:23,750 --> 00:55:25,250
- Is this Huo Feng?
- Hello?

453
00:55:25,292 --> 00:55:27,500
- It's Directer.
- Let me.

454
00:55:28,333 --> 00:55:31,417
Hello, it's me.

455
00:55:32,167 --> 00:55:33,833
It takes so long to fetch a picture.

456
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:35,958
And the lead actress left with you.

457
00:55:36,083 --> 00:55:39,458
Director Zheng, I'll meet You Fei if he's back.

458
00:55:39,792 --> 00:55:41,667
I've sent a car to pick you up.

459
00:55:41,875 --> 00:55:45,500
I've just watched the demo.
Yu Hong has some shots to retake.

460
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:47,792
You guys come back to the studio right away.

461
00:55:48,292 --> 00:55:50,000
Is the director...

462
00:55:54,667 --> 00:55:56,250
asking us to go back immediately.

463
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:58,750
You have to retake some scene,
the car will arrive immediately

464
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:02,250
I think it should retake too.

465
00:56:07,625 --> 00:56:13,042
Huo Feng, Huo Feng!

466
00:56:14,042 --> 00:56:16,583
Someone's calling you downstairs.

467
00:56:16,583 --> 00:56:19,292
- What?
- Huo Feng.

468
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:22,458
Damn, I misheard.

469
00:56:28,083 --> 00:56:30,583
Hey! The director asked me to pick you up.

470
00:56:30,708 --> 00:56:34,000
Don't forget to bring the photo with you.
Come down quickly.

471
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,417
Okay, we'll be right there.

472
00:56:42,333 --> 00:56:44,917
Right, I'll go check on You Fei,
you go down first.

473
00:56:44,917 --> 00:56:48,250
Okay, hurry up!

474
00:57:31,208 --> 00:57:35,500
Photo? I don't have photo.

475
00:57:37,708 --> 00:57:40,708
I have one on my ID card, I'll find it for you.

476
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:42,000
Hurry UP!

477
00:58:12,333 --> 00:58:14,375
Where is it?

478
00:58:16,792 --> 00:58:18,708
My poor memory.

479
00:58:20,292 --> 00:58:23,750
- You mean this one?
- Which one?

480
00:58:25,375 --> 00:58:26,750
This one.

481
00:58:27,542 --> 00:58:31,208
I don't remember I have this photo.

482
00:58:32,667 --> 00:58:34,958
That's a nice Buddha statue.
Where did you get it?

483
00:58:36,083 --> 00:58:39,833
Someone asked me to sell this.

484
00:58:39,833 --> 00:58:43,458
But he died a few days later.

485
00:58:44,792 --> 00:58:47,875
It's not that simple. There's a story.

486
00:58:47,875 --> 00:58:52,417
Don't be ridiculous.
Ever since I got this, I've been rich.

487
00:58:52,708 --> 00:58:56,042
Maybe you take it from the one in basement.

488
00:58:56,042 --> 00:59:00,875
No. Believe it or not. Dead men tell no tales.

489
00:59:01,375 --> 00:59:04,833
Huo Feng, hurry UP!

490
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:08,917
Director, the photo.

491
00:59:11,417 --> 00:59:15,125
Is that him? Where does he live?

492
00:59:16,417 --> 00:59:18,042
He's our neighbor.

493
00:59:19,875 --> 00:59:25,083
That son of a bitch, bring him to me.

494
00:59:25,667 --> 00:59:27,000
What's wrong?

495
00:59:28,917 --> 00:59:32,333
It's him. Go.

496
00:59:33,417 --> 00:59:36,833
Great Buddha, thanks to you, I got rich.

497
00:59:36,833 --> 00:59:39,792
And now, please make me famous.

498
00:59:39,792 --> 00:59:43,333
- You Fei.
- Coming!

499
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:55,333
You Fei. You're going to act.

500
00:59:56,958 --> 00:59:58,500
I'm coming!

501
00:59:59,833 --> 01:00:00,958
I'm coming!

502
01:00:06,542 --> 01:00:07,750
Huo Feng.

503
01:00:09,208 --> 01:00:10,542
You Fei.

504
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:46,958
Weird.

505
01:00:48,208 --> 01:00:51,292
You Fei, hurry up!

506
01:01:05,417 --> 01:01:08,083
Huo Feng, where are you?

507
01:01:08,458 --> 01:01:10,167
I'm here.

508
01:01:19,958 --> 01:01:23,917
Huo Feng, where are you?

509
01:01:33,375 --> 01:01:38,917
- Huo Feng! Huo Feng!
- You Fei, hurry up.

510
01:01:42,542 --> 01:01:46,833
Liu, Take me home.

511
01:01:56,333 --> 01:02:02,000
Huo Feng! Huo Feng!

512
01:02:21,375 --> 01:02:24,125
Help!

513
01:02:24,583 --> 01:02:28,500
Help!

514
01:02:34,583 --> 01:02:37,458
Bastard!

515
01:02:39,208 --> 01:02:42,625
Director, I'm all set here.

516
01:02:43,208 --> 01:02:46,292
Ready... Start!

517
01:02:49,250 --> 01:02:53,417
Lower... lower...

518
01:02:54,750 --> 01:02:55,958
Steady.

519
01:02:56,750 --> 01:03:00,125
Lower... slowly...

520
01:03:00,833 --> 01:03:04,042
Good”.

521
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:35,500
We've been already out of the picture,
why not stop?

522
01:03:36,042 --> 01:03:37,292
Cut.

523
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:43,500
This is too dull,
maybe there can be some new ideas.

524
01:03:48,083 --> 01:03:51,000
You Fei, You Fei.

525
01:04:03,208 --> 01:04:04,417
What's wrong?

526
01:04:04,417 --> 01:04:05,958
Sorry, Director.

527
01:04:05,958 --> 01:04:09,083
Guys, take a break. Where's Huo Feng?

528
01:04:09,083 --> 01:04:11,833
Didn't you just tell him to find the actor?

529
01:04:12,167 --> 01:04:13,792
Send me a car quickly!

530
01:04:44,042 --> 01:04:48,708
Huo Feng! Huo Feng!

531
01:04:49,125 --> 01:04:50,792
Why are you standing there?

532
01:04:51,625 --> 01:04:56,250
Director, come on, come here!

533
01:05:04,167 --> 01:05:09,292
Xiao Ju, you can't revenge like this!

534
01:05:19,583 --> 01:05:23,667
Director? It's his turn.

535
01:05:39,250 --> 01:05:41,625
- Hello?
- Is this Huo Feng?

536
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,958
- Yu Hong, I've got it again.
- What did you say?

537
01:05:46,375 --> 01:05:49,458
I see. What you feel is the past.

538
01:05:49,458 --> 01:05:51,125
What I record is the future.

539
01:05:51,833 --> 01:05:54,250
What's going to happen again?

540
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:56,750
I'm telling you, it's the director.

541
01:05:56,750 --> 01:05:59,500
What should we do?
He's already on the way to your place.

542
01:05:59,500 --> 01:06:02,500
No, I can't let him die like this.

543
01:06:03,458 --> 01:06:06,083
I want to get the proof that he killed Xiao Ju.

544
01:06:06,625 --> 01:06:11,500
Yes, you have to stop him. We can't let him die.

545
01:06:12,417 --> 01:06:16,208
This film is not done yet.
It's very important to me.

546
01:06:16,208 --> 01:06:20,250
Come on, listen to my recording
and feel the past again.

547
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:21,375
<i>Okay-</i>

548
01:08:02,250 --> 01:08:08,042
Xiao Ju, I know you suffered
injustice and horrible death.

549
01:08:09,625 --> 01:08:12,167
You hated the people who killed your parents.

550
01:08:12,875 --> 01:08:16,125
And you hate the person who killed you.

551
01:08:16,792 --> 01:08:19,750
Now you can finally take revenge in your own way.

552
01:08:22,500 --> 01:08:26,667
Maybe you think we living people are hideous.

553
01:08:27,083 --> 01:08:29,542
But we humans have our own rules.

554
01:08:30,625 --> 01:08:33,958
The guilty will be punished.

555
01:08:34,208 --> 01:08:35,833
But definitely not your way.

556
01:08:35,833 --> 01:08:38,333
Don't you go on like this.

557
01:08:41,792 --> 01:08:46,333
I know, Zheng Lei is the criminal.

558
01:08:46,625 --> 01:08:48,542
But I don't have evidence,

559
01:08:48,542 --> 01:08:50,667
You have to help me find evidence,

560
01:08:50,667 --> 01:08:53,417
and let the law sanction him.

561
01:08:56,917 --> 01:09:00,750
If you have anything to say,
say it to the recorder.

562
01:09:10,125 --> 01:09:11,500
Go ahead.

563
01:09:41,583 --> 01:09:42,750
You Fei.

564
01:09:43,083 --> 01:09:45,208
Who are you?

565
01:09:45,208 --> 01:09:49,667
I already gave it back to you, Xiao Ju.

566
01:09:49,667 --> 01:09:53,625
- You Fei.
- I gave it back to you.

567
01:09:54,667 --> 01:10:00,583
I already gave it back to you, Xiao Ju.

568
01:10:01,542 --> 01:10:02,917
Huo Feng.

569
01:10:05,500 --> 01:10:09,792
You Fei, you son of a bitch!

570
01:10:09,792 --> 01:10:12,833
Where's the stuff?

571
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:18,667
I gave it back to you.
Xiao Ju, I gave it back to you.

572
01:10:21,042 --> 01:10:25,250
Xiao Ju, I gave it back to you.

573
01:10:26,083 --> 01:10:29,333
You Fei, where's the golden Buddha?

574
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:31,667
Director Zheng.

575
01:10:34,375 --> 01:10:35,833
He's gone crazy.

576
01:10:38,042 --> 01:10:41,917
- Crazy?
- You've been here before, right?

577
01:10:46,083 --> 01:10:50,208
- Are you kidding? Take me to You Fei.
- Stop!

578
01:10:50,958 --> 01:10:58,417
Go! If you don't leave,
Xiao Ju will come to get you.

579
01:11:11,375 --> 01:11:15,333
I'll go back to the studio first.
You should come, too.

580
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:28,500
Drive! Get back!

581
01:11:52,333 --> 01:11:54,333
Find the evidence.

582
01:12:08,458 --> 01:12:10,875
Xiao Ju, you can't do this.

583
01:12:40,333 --> 01:12:43,542
Xiao Ju, you can't do this.

584
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:29,583
What do you want to say?

585
01:15:20,583 --> 01:15:21,625
HUO Feng!

586
01:15:29,292 --> 01:15:31,250
I'm in the house.

587
01:15:45,125 --> 01:15:49,042
Huo Feng! Huo Feng! What's wrong?

588
01:15:49,750 --> 01:15:50,875
HUO Feng!

589
01:15:52,667 --> 01:15:53,792
I...

590
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:59,125
Huo Feng! Huo Feng!

591
01:16:03,833 --> 01:16:09,833
Hello? First aid station.
Yes, I need first aid station. Yes.

592
01:16:20,458 --> 01:16:22,042
Is this First aid station?

593
01:16:22,042 --> 01:16:24,875
I'm in room 208 of the No.13 eastern district.

594
01:16:24,875 --> 01:16:27,583
Please, come quickly!

595
01:16:49,917 --> 01:16:56,750
Help! Help!

596
01:17:17,667 --> 01:17:22,958
Help! Help!

597
01:17:26,792 --> 01:17:29,708
Comrade Huo Feng is not in danger.

598
01:17:29,708 --> 01:17:33,292
His brain was shocked by the tape recorder.

599
01:17:33,292 --> 01:17:36,458
But it's hard to tell if he'll recover his mind.

600
01:17:39,875 --> 01:17:42,708
So he'll never be able to speak?

601
01:17:42,708 --> 01:17:45,625
Didn't I tell you? It's hard to say.

602
01:17:49,125 --> 01:17:50,292
What about Yu Hong?

603
01:17:50,292 --> 01:17:55,375
Yu Hong was mentally shocked.

604
01:17:55,542 --> 01:17:58,208
We were about to transfer her
to the hospital for treatment.

605
01:18:00,083 --> 01:18:03,083
Fortunately, she finished filming her scene.

606
01:18:03,792 --> 01:18:06,167
Tell us what happened.

607
01:18:07,292 --> 01:18:10,250
Doctor, here's the story.

608
01:18:11,417 --> 01:18:13,417
He found her by accident.

609
01:18:13,417 --> 01:18:16,500
I also saw someone had harmed her in the past.

610
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:18,833
She wanted to take revenge on those who hurt her.

611
01:18:19,042 --> 01:18:22,375
He went to stop her and
she ended up hurting him instead.

612
01:18:23,125 --> 01:18:28,125
Okay, okay, I understand.
You should go home and get some rest.

613
01:18:29,500 --> 01:18:32,750
Doctor, I'm well now. I want to see him.

614
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:34,917
- Just leave.
- I want to see him.

615
01:18:34,917 --> 01:18:36,458
The diagnosis is confirmed.

616
01:18:36,458 --> 01:18:39,875
It's a classic passive-aggressive
personality disorder.

617
01:18:39,917 --> 01:18:44,583
I'm not sick, I'm going to see him.

618
01:18:47,958 --> 01:18:54,167
I'm not sick, doctor.
I'm fine. I'm going to see him.

619
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:03,958
Doctor, I'm not sick. I'm not sick.

620
01:19:11,042 --> 01:19:14,292
Huo Feng, are you feeling better?

621
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:21,667
You know what, the director won an award.
But we end up like this.

622
01:19:21,750 --> 01:19:25,958
I told them there was a ghost,
but they said I was crazy.

623
01:19:27,333 --> 01:19:33,167
Then I told them nothing happened,

624
01:19:33,167 --> 01:19:35,917
I only remember that your ears were bleeding.

625
01:19:35,917 --> 01:19:38,417
I don't remember anything else.

626
01:19:39,917 --> 01:19:43,042
And they said I was recovered.

627
01:19:45,042 --> 01:19:47,417
I'm going to find that little ghost.

628
01:19:47,417 --> 01:19:49,667
That's not fair to you.

629
01:19:54,583 --> 01:19:56,417
- You...
- What?

630
01:19:58,167 --> 01:20:06,667
You should go and help her.

631
01:20:11,792 --> 01:20:15,542
She's right. Go to her.

632
01:20:15,542 --> 01:20:17,542
Go and find her...

633
01:20:24,417 --> 01:20:26,000
This film...

634
01:20:27,417 --> 01:20:29,417
It's meant to evoke people's conscience.

635
01:20:30,792 --> 01:20:34,083
It's about raising people's conscience.

636
01:20:35,042 --> 01:20:38,375
It seems that this film has achieved

637
01:20:38,375 --> 01:20:41,042
to promote the virtues of our ancient people

638
01:20:42,833 --> 01:20:49,625
including sincerity, kindness, mutual help,
and the virtue of solidarity.

639
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:19,708
Xiao Ju, Huo Feng asked me to
take you to Zheng Lei.

640
01:22:32,417 --> 01:22:35,750
You can take revenge in your own way.

641
01:22:37,167 --> 01:22:39,750
We'll help you get justice.

642
01:22:41,833 --> 01:22:43,542
But what's next?

643
01:23:20,583 --> 01:23:24,292
I hope it will flourish.

644
01:23:24,375 --> 01:23:27,625
I will feel greatly grateful for this.

645
01:23:27,625 --> 01:23:30,833
Thank you!

646
01:23:37,625 --> 01:23:40,917
Director Zheng,
what is your motive for making this film?

647
01:23:41,583 --> 01:23:43,875
This question... how to say...

648
01:23:43,875 --> 01:23:45,292
It's a very complicated question.

649
01:23:45,292 --> 01:23:47,875
I can't answer this right now,
so please forgive me.

650
01:23:47,875 --> 01:23:50,833
Director Zheng, what is your opinion on
domestic commercial films?

651
01:23:51,167 --> 01:23:52,958
Domestic commercial films...

652
01:24:09,333 --> 01:24:11,125
Director, please sign this for me.

653
01:24:11,125 --> 01:24:13,292
How do you feel about your film winning the award?

654
01:24:13,333 --> 01:24:14,625
I feel a lot,

655
01:24:14,625 --> 01:24:16,750
you will read about it in my article.

656
01:24:16,875 --> 01:24:18,583
Can I ask you questions other than your film?

657
01:24:18,583 --> 01:24:20,333
I'm happy to answer as long as
it's related to the film.

658
01:24:20,333 --> 01:24:21,833
You said that the actress and the sound recordist

659
01:24:21,833 --> 01:24:23,542
are in the hospital. What happened?

660
01:24:23,542 --> 01:24:25,625
It's complicated. You will find out in the future.

661
01:24:25,625 --> 01:24:28,958
Director Zheng, will your film be on abroad?

662
01:24:28,958 --> 01:24:30,333
I think it will be.

663
01:24:30,333 --> 01:24:33,167
Although our cultures and histories are different.

664
01:24:33,167 --> 01:24:36,417
The common love of mankind
is always the same, right?

665
01:24:36,917 --> 01:24:38,958
You made lots of exploration in this film.

666
01:24:38,958 --> 01:24:40,208
Do you think it's a success?

667
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:42,792
Well, it's hard to say.
Let the critics comment on it.

668
01:24:42,792 --> 01:24:44,958
Director! Hope to seeing you again.

669
01:24:47,083 --> 01:24:48,958
Please accept our congratulations, director.

670
01:24:48,958 --> 01:24:49,958
Thank you very much!

671
01:24:49,958 --> 01:24:53,625
Please stay, Goodbye.

672
01:24:53,625 --> 01:24:56,000
- Thank you.
- Goodbye!

673
01:24:57,500 --> 01:25:02,458
- Goodbye.
- Congratulations.

674
01:25:02,458 --> 01:25:05,333
Thank you! Thank you very much!

675
01:30:08,583 --> 01:30:10,333
Hanged like this.

676
01:30:38,208 --> 01:30:39,542
Time for medicine.
