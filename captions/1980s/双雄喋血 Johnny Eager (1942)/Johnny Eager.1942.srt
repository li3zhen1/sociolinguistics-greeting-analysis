1
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,300
Nix, nix. This is no Cab Stand.
─ Oh Officer, give me a break will you.

2
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,455
I must file a report and
every second counts today.

3
00:01:32,555 --> 00:01:34,726
I've only had two fares all morning.
─ I know, but if ..

4
00:01:34,826 --> 00:01:36,890
I'll only be a second.
Give me a break, will you.

5
00:01:37,904 --> 00:01:40,134
Alright, run along. But hurry.
─ Thanks, Officer.

6
00:01:49,932 --> 00:01:51,742
Hello.
─ Hello there.

7
00:01:53,886 --> 00:01:54,932
It's alright, Ann.

8
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:56,694
Thank you.

9
00:01:59,648 --> 00:02:02,177
Well .. how you been, Mr Eager?

10
00:02:02,449 --> 00:02:03,492
Okay. Swell.

11
00:02:04,195 --> 00:02:06,635
Did you ever see that movie
I told you about last time?

12
00:02:07,422 --> 00:02:09,066
Never found out where it was playing.

13
00:02:09,166 --> 00:02:11,419
I know where it's at this week.
I could see it again.

14
00:02:11,617 --> 00:02:12,443
Well, I ..

15
00:02:13,374 --> 00:02:14,523
Hello, Miss Mines.

16
00:02:22,027 --> 00:02:26,136
In that cab of yours, you ever sit a
thing up front with you except a trunk?

17
00:02:26,522 --> 00:02:28,430
I'd like to, but every
trunk means a dollar.

18
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:31,090
What's the fun of putting your
arm around a piece of luggage?

19
00:02:32,678 --> 00:02:34,412
Mr Verne will see you now.

20
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:50,301
Hello, Mr Verne.
─ Hello Johnny. Sit down.

21
00:02:50,488 --> 00:02:51,647
Sit down.
─ Thank you.

22
00:02:52,577 --> 00:02:55,771
Well, still living with your cousin
Peg and her daughter, eh?

23
00:02:55,971 --> 00:02:57,900
Yeah. The kid finishes
high school next month.

24
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:00,515
Maybe we'll get Miss Mines
here to give her a job.

25
00:03:00,615 --> 00:03:01,342
Well ..

26
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:03,559
Is there anything else, Mr Verne?
─ No. Thanks.

27
00:03:10,882 --> 00:03:13,353
Funny. Why do you suppose
Miss Mines doesn't like me?

28
00:03:13,748 --> 00:03:16,286
Well, Miss Mines is beyond
he age of tolerance, I guess.

29
00:03:16,868 --> 00:03:18,084
Johnny, this is splendid.

30
00:03:18,615 --> 00:03:21,460
You keep your parole as clean as this,
you'll be out of our hands in a year.

31
00:03:21,659 --> 00:03:24,486
Can't be too soon for me.
─ I know. It's a strain isn't it.

32
00:03:25,141 --> 00:03:28,122
Yes, it's no fun knowing you can go back
up there just for having a few beers.

33
00:03:28,467 --> 00:03:30,885
That's the only thing I ever liked
you know. A good glass of beer.

34
00:03:31,387 --> 00:03:34,047
And then there are a lot of loud
mouths in the hack business.

35
00:03:34,522 --> 00:03:37,531
It's kind of tough when you have to back
off when you'd like to poke one of them.

36
00:03:37,987 --> 00:03:39,833
You know how it is, Mr Verne.
─ I know.

37
00:03:40,351 --> 00:03:41,518
Well. That's all.

38
00:03:42,256 --> 00:03:43,758
Keep up the good work.
─ Yes, sir.

39
00:03:44,128 --> 00:03:46,333
Johnny .. ever get
hungry for the old days?

40
00:03:46,543 --> 00:03:49,367
Those 200 dollar suits, the
big bankroll and the girls?

41
00:03:49,846 --> 00:03:52,693
Sure. I'd be a chump
not to admit it, Mr Verne.

42
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,409
Specially when I see some of the old mob
still sailing around high and handsome.

43
00:03:57,595 --> 00:03:59,696
Then I think about that
cell down at Stateville.

44
00:03:59,863 --> 00:04:03,483
And the time I did ten days on the shelf
just for tossing a guy a bag of macons.

45
00:04:04,115 --> 00:04:07,192
Now if I stub my toe just once more, I
go back for the rest of that five years.

46
00:04:08,270 --> 00:04:11,137
I think about things like that and then
I don't miss being a big-shot at all.

47
00:04:11,512 --> 00:04:13,524
I wish all my boys were
as level-headed as you.

48
00:04:13,932 --> 00:04:16,607
Keep thinking that way Johnny, and
we'll never have to send you back there.

49
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:18,741
Well, see you next month.
─ Goodbye, Mr Verne.

50
00:04:19,013 --> 00:04:19,742
Goodbye.

51
00:04:26,564 --> 00:04:29,253
Well. How are my young
sociology students today?

52
00:04:29,725 --> 00:04:30,941
Would you come in please?

53
00:04:31,631 --> 00:04:32,994
Good grief, Mr Verne.

54
00:04:33,445 --> 00:04:35,558
Do you mean to tell me
<i>that</i> is an ex-convict?

55
00:04:35,798 --> 00:04:38,126
Oh yes. He was quite
notorious at one time.

56
00:04:38,774 --> 00:04:40,149
Did you notice that profile?

57
00:04:40,396 --> 00:04:42,696
You could put it on a coin.
─ Oh Jean, really.

58
00:04:42,866 --> 00:04:43,824
Well you could.

59
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:48,427
Thanks, Officer.
─ Did you ever see those pooches run?

60
00:04:48,907 --> 00:04:49,914
No. Never did.

61
00:04:50,235 --> 00:04:53,434
I don't get that that guy Marco will
ever get that cracked open in this town.

62
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,343
I sure hope they do.

63
00:04:55,633 --> 00:04:58,396
Mr Marco pays those fellows ten bucks
a month for hauling those signs around.

64
00:04:58,805 --> 00:04:59,792
So long, Officer.

65
00:05:08,249 --> 00:05:11,625
Mr Verne. When these paroled men
come in and report every month.

66
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:13,372
Can you believe what they tell you?

67
00:05:13,688 --> 00:05:15,064
We want to, naturally.

68
00:05:15,896 --> 00:05:18,327
Now, there is the report
on the man who just left.

69
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,054
By the name of John Eager.

70
00:05:20,552 --> 00:05:22,128
And .. there is his record.

71
00:05:23,581 --> 00:05:24,403
John Eager.

72
00:05:27,106 --> 00:05:29,269
You believe him, Mr Verne?
─ Oh yes.

73
00:05:29,757 --> 00:05:32,238
Johnny has learnt his lesson.
He's a solid citizen now.

74
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,106
I somehow got the impression that he
looked a little more ambitious than ..

75
00:05:38,252 --> 00:05:40,165
Well, just to stay driving a cab.

76
00:05:41,984 --> 00:05:43,781
How can you be sure this report is true?

77
00:05:44,146 --> 00:05:45,603
Well, that's quite easy.

78
00:05:46,114 --> 00:05:49,694
We have a practice of dropping in
unexpectedly at the homes of parolees.

79
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,158
From time to time.

80
00:05:51,691 --> 00:05:53,193
They have no warning of our visits.

81
00:05:53,773 --> 00:05:55,954
That way we can inspect their home life.

82
00:05:56,329 --> 00:05:59,961
See their surroundings aren't conducive
to a return to their criminal pursuits.

83
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,119
Good grief, Lisbeth. Listen.

84
00:06:02,853 --> 00:06:05,621
That nice looking thing
has had 38 indictments.

85
00:06:06,186 --> 00:06:09,185
He was only tried and found
guilty on one of them, I might say.

86
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,727
Two for manslaughter. Imagine.

87
00:06:12,425 --> 00:06:14,041
Three for assault with a deadly weapon.

88
00:06:14,429 --> 00:06:15,502
Gambling operations.

89
00:06:16,337 --> 00:06:17,295
This is amazing.

90
00:06:18,192 --> 00:06:20,361
Did he ever really kill
anybody, Mr Verne?

91
00:06:20,777 --> 00:06:22,151
The State has never said so.

92
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,279
The way Johnny is going now.

93
00:06:24,845 --> 00:06:26,261
I like to think he never did.

94
00:06:42,977 --> 00:06:45,243
Is Mr Marco around?
─ Up in the office.

95
00:06:52,998 --> 00:06:54,269
That's Wilson's new bitch.

96
00:06:54,727 --> 00:06:56,310
She's sure got a stride, hasn't she.

97
00:06:56,896 --> 00:06:59,144
Well, it won't do Wilson any
good if this joint don't open.

98
00:06:59,395 --> 00:07:01,269
Marco said this morning
that it was in the bag.

99
00:07:01,552 --> 00:07:04,240
Well if it ain't this time, I'm taking
my string and pulling out of here.

100
00:07:22,976 --> 00:07:23,701
Hiya.

101
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:09,441
Hello, boss.
─ Hi.

102
00:08:13,504 --> 00:08:15,473
Look at that crazy cockroach.

103
00:08:15,773 --> 00:08:18,672
Come on, insect. Win for Benjy and
I'll put you back in the kitchen again.

104
00:08:18,905 --> 00:08:20,286
Come on, come on!

105
00:08:22,424 --> 00:08:24,534
Bet you a thousand.
─ I'll take five hundred of it.

106
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,540
Five hundred still open. Lew?

107
00:08:28,068 --> 00:08:29,412
That ain't enough.

108
00:08:29,633 --> 00:08:30,724
I'll take it, Marco.

109
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:32,218
You're on.

110
00:08:34,234 --> 00:08:36,244
Here, Mr Eager. Don't you
think this one is better?

111
00:08:36,344 --> 00:08:37,330
More flash to it.

112
00:08:37,718 --> 00:08:40,479
Billy, can you just keep on dumping the
ashtrays and bringing my ham and eggs.

113
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:41,676
I'll dress myself.

114
00:08:41,803 --> 00:08:44,435
Now look, boss. I'm supposed to be a
gentleman's gentleman or something.

115
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:47,013
Now, ain't I? You got to take
my advice about these things.

116
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,231
Behave, will you.

117
00:08:48,674 --> 00:08:49,989
Oh, you win!

118
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:53,046
Pay up, sucker.

119
00:08:53,446 --> 00:08:56,547
I don't know why a man should wait
when this kind of lettuce harvest is on.

120
00:08:56,707 --> 00:08:59,372
I'm through with cockroaches.
They carry germs.

121
00:08:59,951 --> 00:09:00,657
Hello?

122
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:03,046
Hello. Jeff Hartnett around there?

123
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:07,107
You won yourself a quick
and easy five there, Johnny.

124
00:09:07,402 --> 00:09:09,483
Eager always gets his the easy way.

125
00:09:10,106 --> 00:09:12,350
We do all the work and
he gets all the money.

126
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:14,350
That's right, Lew.

127
00:09:14,832 --> 00:09:18,238
Yeah, you do all the work.
But he does all the thinking.

128
00:09:18,787 --> 00:09:21,093
Hey, Eager?
─ These painting bills are brutal.

129
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,002
Hey Benjy, what about that
Cop over on Fallway?

130
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,522
I can't do nothing with him.

131
00:09:25,801 --> 00:09:27,228
Stubborn, huh?
─ And dumb.

132
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:30,401
He says no slot-machines going to run
on his beat as long as he's walking it.

133
00:09:30,817 --> 00:09:32,362
Maybe he'd like a different beat.

134
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:33,616
I figured that.

135
00:09:34,232 --> 00:09:37,144
His name is Advernöwksi.
Badge number 711.

136
00:09:37,903 --> 00:09:41,340
711 .. a lucky number
for an unlucky guy.

137
00:09:41,638 --> 00:09:42,739
I'll take care of it.

138
00:09:43,059 --> 00:09:45,197
You've more rounds to make
haven't you?          ─ Yeah.

139
00:09:45,297 --> 00:09:47,519
And get those girls out of here.
─ Sure, sure.

140
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:51,382
Come on you squabs.
I'll give you something.

141
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,318
Say, how about some Jack?

142
00:09:53,784 --> 00:09:56,664
Five hundred on a cockroach,
but if I ask for a buck what do I get?

143
00:09:57,105 --> 00:09:57,806
Conned.

144
00:09:58,302 --> 00:10:00,009
You got me to get married, didn't you?

145
00:10:00,432 --> 00:10:01,443
Come on.

146
00:10:04,832 --> 00:10:06,162
You got anything for me, Lew?

147
00:10:15,244 --> 00:10:16,116
What's wrong?

148
00:10:17,487 --> 00:10:19,789
I'm not holding out.
─ Nobody said you were.

149
00:10:20,374 --> 00:10:22,750
The way this town is shut down
there is nothing <i>to</i> hold out.

150
00:10:23,006 --> 00:10:26,751
Haven't a dozen books running. No dice,
no roulette. My whole crowd is hungry.

151
00:10:27,225 --> 00:10:29,185
That's the way it goes.
Some fat years, some lean.

152
00:10:29,314 --> 00:10:31,528
From where I sit it looks
like a string of lean ones.

153
00:10:32,626 --> 00:10:35,149
Well, I'll be seeing you.
At the back of a tin cup.

154
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:37,481
Hey, Lew.

155
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,846
You sound like something's
itching at you.

156
00:10:41,946 --> 00:10:44,506
Do you expect me to sing Happy Days
with things the way they are?

157
00:10:44,654 --> 00:10:46,982
I got sixty slot collectors
on my payroll you know.

158
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:50,286
I can't pay them off with conversation.
─ Who asked you to talk anyway?

159
00:10:50,768 --> 00:10:51,389
I was.

160
00:10:51,489 --> 00:10:54,496
Blaming me for the lid on this town?
─ No, of course not.

161
00:10:54,596 --> 00:10:56,389
Well, we're getting no place fast.

162
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,293
Something has got to crack pretty soon.

163
00:11:02,085 --> 00:11:04,138
This is a laugh. You and
me barking at each other.

164
00:11:04,238 --> 00:11:06,410
Why, we've been pals since
we were news kids together.

165
00:11:06,821 --> 00:11:09,558
Put it on the table, Lew. You think I'm
giving you the wrong end of the deal?

166
00:11:10,917 --> 00:11:11,840
Sorry, Johnny.

167
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:14,633
Just being short of dough
is giving me the grouch.

168
00:11:16,205 --> 00:11:17,437
You're not sore, are you?

169
00:11:17,537 --> 00:11:20,040
No, of course not, Lew. I'm as
touchy as you are. That's all.

170
00:11:20,222 --> 00:11:21,940
Okay, Johnny. So long.

171
00:11:22,325 --> 00:11:23,197
So long, Lew.

172
00:11:31,353 --> 00:11:34,351
Have a couple of the boys see what Lew
does with his time in the next few days.

173
00:11:35,302 --> 00:11:36,318
Put a tail on him?

174
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:38,851
Why, you're not worried about Lew?

175
00:11:39,707 --> 00:11:41,117
Why that's silly, Johnny.

176
00:11:41,642 --> 00:11:43,201
You and Lew have been pals for years.

177
00:11:44,056 --> 00:11:45,232
You just said yourself.

178
00:11:45,471 --> 00:11:47,406
You had a news-stand
together when you were kids.

179
00:11:47,563 --> 00:11:49,808
That's right. On Baker Street.
─ Well then ..

180
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:52,516
I got it.

181
00:11:53,191 --> 00:11:54,738
You still want him tailed?

182
00:11:56,219 --> 00:11:58,939
It almost makes me
wonder if you trust me.

183
00:11:59,973 --> 00:12:01,253
A silly question, Marco.

184
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:09,298
I've half a million bucks in this layout
and we've got to open. You understand?

185
00:12:09,623 --> 00:12:11,337
When will you get the injunction lifted?

186
00:12:11,437 --> 00:12:13,989
Now I've got to tell you about that.
─ You mean you can't get it, huh?

187
00:12:14,277 --> 00:12:17,464
Johnny, I've been in front of 5 judges
Every one of them has refused.

188
00:12:17,742 --> 00:12:19,616
What more can I do?
They're all afraid to move.

189
00:12:19,766 --> 00:12:20,381
Why?

190
00:12:20,758 --> 00:12:22,967
Our new City Prosecutor, Mr Farrell.

191
00:12:23,398 --> 00:12:26,311
Farrell, huh? Wouldn't you know I'd
have to run into him a second time.

192
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,941
He helped the D.A. send
you away once, Johnny.

193
00:12:29,534 --> 00:12:31,215
He wasn't any pushover then.

194
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:32,963
Go easy now.

195
00:12:33,164 --> 00:12:35,601
John Benson Farrell.
That righteous old rat.

196
00:12:36,135 --> 00:12:39,208
He comes out of retirement, gets elected
to a chicken-coop job like Prosecutor.

197
00:12:39,487 --> 00:12:41,957
What the idea with all his dough
and reputation, I wonder?

198
00:12:42,696 --> 00:12:44,980
Sometimes a wrong number
comes up on the dice.

199
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:47,906
Only a sucker plays with
dice he can't handle.

200
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:50,958
What about Halligan and his boys?
They've got a barrel of my money.

201
00:12:51,058 --> 00:12:52,967
They think I'll fold and
not get my dough back?

202
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:55,346
You ever hear of a politician
paying back anything?

203
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,987
Of course, you can talk to
Halligan yourself if you want.

204
00:12:58,087 --> 00:12:59,417
Exactly what I'm going to do.

205
00:12:59,535 --> 00:13:01,638
You beat it now, and arrange
for a meeting. Right here.

206
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:05,030
Johnny, do you think that's best?
─ Arrange it, Marco. And for soon.

207
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,966
Okay, Johnny.

208
00:13:11,904 --> 00:13:13,128
Hello, Garnet.
─ Hello.

209
00:13:23,148 --> 00:13:24,249
Let me speak to Dave.

210
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:32,222
Well, you're not exactly Romeo.

211
00:13:32,777 --> 00:13:34,021
You're not exactly Juliet.

212
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,974
You might say you like it.

213
00:13:36,404 --> 00:13:38,944
Any time I don't like it you'll
hear me loud and clear.

214
00:13:42,502 --> 00:13:44,923
Dave .. seen Jeff Hartnett today?

215
00:13:46,422 --> 00:13:47,551
No .. okay.

216
00:13:48,905 --> 00:13:52,169
If you're looking for Mr Hartnett,
he was here earlier this morning.

217
00:13:52,735 --> 00:13:54,867
He was? Well, didn't you tell
him I wanted to see him?

218
00:13:55,168 --> 00:13:57,175
Oh sure, but he wandered away.

219
00:13:57,448 --> 00:13:59,018
Full of gin and big words.

220
00:14:00,433 --> 00:14:02,427
Say, who was Herod Agrippa?

221
00:14:02,712 --> 00:14:04,482
He took a fine time to throw a bender.

222
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,904
Who was who?
─ Herod Agrippa.

223
00:14:08,767 --> 00:14:09,783
I don't know. Why?

224
00:14:10,077 --> 00:14:12,814
Well, he said you were the
modern-day Herod Agrippa.

225
00:14:13,536 --> 00:14:16,243
And then he said I was your Inamorata.

226
00:14:16,987 --> 00:14:19,398
I'm going to get a load
of what that means, too.

227
00:14:19,789 --> 00:14:22,887
You just keep checking up on Jeff's
big words and we'll both get educated.

228
00:14:24,896 --> 00:14:25,649
Yeah?

229
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:27,853
I'm bringing some
guests home for dinner.

230
00:14:28,814 --> 00:14:30,940
So you'd better leave the
office as early as you can.

231
00:14:31,766 --> 00:14:32,438
Right.

232
00:14:33,788 --> 00:14:35,964
What now?
─ Oh, Mines has called.

233
00:14:36,322 --> 00:14:38,139
I got to get out to the
west side in a hurry.

234
00:14:39,466 --> 00:14:40,388
Poor Mines.

235
00:14:41,147 --> 00:14:43,326
Is there any dame you
haven't got in your pocket?

236
00:14:43,902 --> 00:14:45,461
You don't feel crowded do you, sugar?

237
00:15:09,085 --> 00:15:10,288
Who's there?
─ Me.

238
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:13,948
Somebody is coming, huh?
─ Yeah a bird.

239
00:15:14,384 --> 00:15:16,238
Better have some coffee on.
─ Sure. Alright.

240
00:15:17,112 --> 00:15:18,442
You look good.
─ I'm okay.

241
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:20,631
Here is the paper. Matilda!

242
00:15:20,863 --> 00:15:21,569
What?

243
00:15:22,095 --> 00:15:23,389
Oh hello, uncle Johnny.

244
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:26,396
I bet the investigators are coming or
you wouldn't come near this rat-trap.

245
00:15:26,496 --> 00:15:28,508
Matilda, stop being so
fresh with your uncle John.

246
00:15:28,608 --> 00:15:30,720
Where do you think we'd
be if it wasn't for him, huh?

247
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,155
He gets what he pays for.

248
00:15:33,615 --> 00:15:36,268
Johnny, why don't you talk to her?
I can't do nothing with her.

249
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:39,009
She was out in some dance-hall
until 3 o'clock this morning.

250
00:15:39,304 --> 00:15:40,691
Didn't even go to school today.

251
00:15:40,798 --> 00:15:42,776
Don't worry, Peggy. A kid's
got to have some fun.

252
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:45,036
Mattie is a good girl. You've
got nothing to worry about.

253
00:15:45,582 --> 00:15:46,340
I wonder.

254
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:48,739
You've got sense, haven't you kid?

255
00:15:51,196 --> 00:15:52,040
Haven't you?

256
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,944
Sure I have.

257
00:15:57,688 --> 00:15:59,127
Mr Verne is just driving up now.

258
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,719
Ah, go get your books.

259
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:03,629
Wipe that paint off your mouth.
─ Sure.

260
00:16:12,349 --> 00:16:14,287
Honestly Julie, I don't
feel we ought to.

261
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:16,298
Oh come on, silly. It's exciting.

262
00:16:16,536 --> 00:16:17,895
It's quite alright, Miss Bard.

263
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:20,721
Why hello, Mr Verne.
─ Hello, Mrs Fowler.

264
00:16:20,962 --> 00:16:21,998
Come on in.

265
00:16:26,173 --> 00:16:27,661
Well, hello Mr Verne.

266
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:29,881
Twice in one day.
I must be popular with you.

267
00:16:30,094 --> 00:16:31,503
Just the usual routine, Johnny.

268
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,873
Miss Sanford, Miss Bard - Mr Eager.

269
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:35,753
How do you do.

270
00:16:35,853 --> 00:16:38,572
And this is Mrs Fowler.
And Miss Fowler.

271
00:16:38,906 --> 00:16:40,247
Hello.
─ How do you do.

272
00:16:40,453 --> 00:16:42,608
Well, isn't that nice.
Won't you sit down please.

273
00:16:42,774 --> 00:16:44,390
We were just going to have some coffee.

274
00:16:44,490 --> 00:16:45,662
I'll go and bring it.

275
00:16:45,762 --> 00:16:47,907
Yeah, coffee. Find yourself some chairs.

276
00:16:48,316 --> 00:16:49,933
Mr Verne.
─ As I told you.

277
00:16:50,293 --> 00:16:51,697
My favorite parolee.

278
00:16:52,825 --> 00:16:55,383
These two young ladies are taking
a course in sociology, Johnny.

279
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:57,869
They were sent to me to help
them with their fieldwork.

280
00:16:57,969 --> 00:16:59,618
Sociology? Well, let's see now.

281
00:17:00,492 --> 00:17:02,409
It's a study of social conditions.

282
00:17:03,179 --> 00:17:04,687
Seeing how the other half lives.

283
00:17:05,797 --> 00:17:08,415
I mean things like .. crime.

284
00:17:11,059 --> 00:17:13,526
Well .. you understand
what I mean, Mr Eager.

285
00:17:13,707 --> 00:17:14,465
I get it.

286
00:17:14,565 --> 00:17:16,429
How is your schoolwork
coming along, Matilda?

287
00:17:16,529 --> 00:17:18,914
Oh fine. I love it.
─ That's good.

288
00:17:19,154 --> 00:17:21,145
Uncle Johnny is helping
me with my homework.

289
00:17:21,776 --> 00:17:23,878
You see, Mr Eager is
really not Matilda's uncle.

290
00:17:24,088 --> 00:17:25,275
She just calls him that.

291
00:17:25,616 --> 00:17:28,110
Her father was married to
Mrs Fowler who is Johnny's cousin.

292
00:17:28,894 --> 00:17:30,110
Isn't that right, Johnny?

293
00:17:30,847 --> 00:17:32,468
Huh? Yeah, yeah. That's right.

294
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:36,591
Yeah, Matt was a great guy.
We were in business together.

295
00:17:37,459 --> 00:17:39,503
You mean .. he's not living now?

296
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:42,917
He was killed in an automobile.
─ Oh ..

297
00:17:43,818 --> 00:17:45,801
It's terrible, these
automobile accidents.

298
00:17:46,086 --> 00:17:48,456
This was on purpose by some
rats with a sawn-off shotgun.

299
00:17:48,627 --> 00:17:50,963
Hey, Matilda.
─ Here here. Now, kid.

300
00:17:51,986 --> 00:17:54,991
You really can't blame her.
She gets pretty riled up about it.

301
00:17:55,253 --> 00:17:56,182
Of course.

302
00:17:56,399 --> 00:17:58,649
We were going to drop in on
some of the other boys, Johnny.

303
00:17:58,749 --> 00:18:02,372
But when Miss Sanford heard about you
she particularly wanted to visit here.

304
00:18:04,099 --> 00:18:05,399
You did? Why?

305
00:18:06,104 --> 00:18:08,252
Oh my name is "Bard". She's "Sanford".

306
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:10,216
Oh.
─ Oh yes.

307
00:18:10,615 --> 00:18:13,347
As a matter of fact, Liz didn't
want to come at all. Did you, Liz?

308
00:18:13,696 --> 00:18:15,259
No? Why not?

309
00:18:16,392 --> 00:18:19,039
Well .. well, I think it's
rather an imposition.

310
00:18:20,211 --> 00:18:22,565
I mean it's rather embarrassing
to have us come in this way.

311
00:18:23,622 --> 00:18:24,610
I'm very sorry.

312
00:18:25,026 --> 00:18:26,496
Don't be. I'm glad you came.

313
00:18:27,643 --> 00:18:30,032
If you've been where I've been,
you can never get enough company.

314
00:18:32,506 --> 00:18:33,207
Thanks.

315
00:18:34,296 --> 00:18:36,317
Matilda, what is your homework?
─ What?

316
00:18:37,429 --> 00:18:40,965
Oh .. we got to pick out some
famous character in fiction and ..

317
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:44,108
Write an essay on something they said.

318
00:18:44,684 --> 00:18:46,774
Oh. Have you decided on anybody?

319
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,721
Why no. We can't think of a good one.

320
00:18:49,956 --> 00:18:51,906
Yeah .. it's kind of tough.

321
00:18:52,808 --> 00:18:55,301
I know. What about A Tale Of Two Cities?

322
00:18:55,466 --> 00:18:57,091
When Sidney Carton was in jail, and ..

323
00:18:58,759 --> 00:19:00,511
No? No good ..

324
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,201
There is that speech I always
like in Cyrano De Bergerac.

325
00:19:04,516 --> 00:19:06,687
When Cyrano is telling
Roxanne the meaning of a kiss.

326
00:19:07,103 --> 00:19:08,119
Yeah, what's that?

327
00:19:08,784 --> 00:19:09,800
The kiss, he said.

328
00:19:10,099 --> 00:19:12,101
"I do not see why your
lips do not dare want."

329
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,115
It is the divine secret which
one mouth tells the other one.

330
00:19:15,215 --> 00:19:16,545
When neither needs to listen.

331
00:19:17,564 --> 00:19:20,375
It is the pilgrimage of the heart
across the lips to the soul.

332
00:19:22,152 --> 00:19:24,093
Cyrano, huh? Well, I'll go for that.

333
00:19:24,521 --> 00:19:27,367
Where do I read about the guy?
I guess the girl said yes, huh?

334
00:19:27,754 --> 00:19:30,700
No .. he was making love for
Christian, his best friend.

335
00:19:31,309 --> 00:19:32,972
He sent Christian to receive the kiss.

336
00:19:33,295 --> 00:19:34,812
Why? What was his angle?

337
00:19:35,773 --> 00:19:37,174
Well you see, he was afraid.

338
00:19:37,774 --> 00:19:38,824
He was very ugly.

339
00:19:39,877 --> 00:19:40,463
Oh.

340
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:43,290
What's wrong? You not going to read it?
─ No.

341
00:19:43,535 --> 00:19:46,732
Ugly or not, I'm not interested in a guy
who don't finish what he starts.

342
00:19:49,249 --> 00:19:51,224
Well come on girls. We've
got to be running along.

343
00:19:51,682 --> 00:19:53,503
Goodbye, Mrs Fowler.
Thanks for the coffee.

344
00:19:54,088 --> 00:19:56,000
You're growing to be a
fine young girl, Matilda.

345
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:57,381
Oh thanks, Mr Verne.

346
00:19:57,633 --> 00:19:59,445
Goodbye everybody. Goodbye, Mr Eager.

347
00:19:59,659 --> 00:20:00,789
Goodbye.
─ Thank you.

348
00:20:01,257 --> 00:20:03,180
It's been very pleasant.
─ Yeah.

349
00:20:04,092 --> 00:20:06,022
Sorry about your man, Cyrano.

350
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,594
Well, I'd never thought
of it quite that way.

351
00:20:09,371 --> 00:20:11,016
Perhaps you're right. Goodbye.

352
00:20:12,081 --> 00:20:12,925
Goodbye.

353
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:17,078
And they call this a free country.

354
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:19,265
Busting into your house like that.

355
00:20:19,571 --> 00:20:23,243
Did you see the face on that blond
rat when she smelt my coffee? Huh?

356
00:20:31,999 --> 00:20:33,583
Uncle Johnny.
─ What?

357
00:20:34,173 --> 00:20:35,104
That Miss Bard.

358
00:20:35,403 --> 00:20:37,397
Any time you want to whistle,
she'll come running.

359
00:20:37,497 --> 00:20:38,363
Forget that.

360
00:20:38,685 --> 00:20:40,140
Any time you want to whistle.

361
00:20:40,628 --> 00:20:41,796
I watched her eyes.

362
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:43,826
You watched them, too. You know it.

363
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,094
Here. Go cut yourself a rug someplace.

364
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,760
Thank you, uncle Johnny.

365
00:20:48,571 --> 00:20:50,205
But, any time you want to whistle ..

366
00:21:08,052 --> 00:21:10,378
I told Winnie we'd drop by.
She's having a crowd.

367
00:21:12,841 --> 00:21:15,890
Isn't that Eager individual the
handsomest thing you ever saw?

368
00:21:17,282 --> 00:21:19,030
I don't think handsome is just the word.

369
00:21:19,956 --> 00:21:23,169
His face is well cut, but once
for a moment there, he ..

370
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:24,926
Became hard.

371
00:21:26,753 --> 00:21:29,157
I think he'd beat a woman
if she made him angry.

372
00:21:31,434 --> 00:21:33,011
I wonder.
─ What?

373
00:21:34,472 --> 00:21:37,093
Oh. What sort of a woman
he goes around with.

374
00:21:38,133 --> 00:21:38,990
Hey, chum.

375
00:21:39,657 --> 00:21:41,703
There is a limit to this
sociology business you know.

376
00:21:42,543 --> 00:21:43,187
Oh ..

377
00:21:50,615 --> 00:21:51,372
Hello.

378
00:21:56,671 --> 00:21:57,543
Hello, sweet.

379
00:21:58,563 --> 00:21:59,722
Hello, Floyd.
─ Hello.

380
00:21:59,863 --> 00:22:02,882
Darling, I'll run along. I've a squash
game at the club. I'll stop by at seven.

381
00:22:03,205 --> 00:22:05,311
Seven? Well, what ..?
─ The Art Museum dinner.

382
00:22:05,551 --> 00:22:07,648
You promised in a weak moment
We can't get out of it.

383
00:22:07,748 --> 00:22:10,303
Oh Jimmy, no.
─ Darling, I'm stuck. I have to go.

384
00:22:10,482 --> 00:22:13,196
That's what comes with inheriting
a directorship in a society waxworks.

385
00:22:13,466 --> 00:22:14,367
Oh, Jimmy.

386
00:22:14,923 --> 00:22:17,232
May I beg off? I'll meet you
afterwards someplace.

387
00:22:17,742 --> 00:22:20,240
Well sure, Liz .. what's the matter?

388
00:22:20,488 --> 00:22:21,217
Nothing.

389
00:22:21,509 --> 00:22:24,838
Just those old beards and bodices
sitting round talking about dead things.

390
00:22:25,027 --> 00:22:27,900
She's bored, that's all.
Your Fiancée is bored of it.

391
00:22:28,174 --> 00:22:31,393
Come out with Gail tonight. We'll pick
up this prematurely aged gargoyle later.

392
00:22:31,493 --> 00:22:34,103
Wait a minute.
─ I'd love to, Floyd. A good Samaritan.

393
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:35,745
Hmm, sounds like a cure.

394
00:22:36,110 --> 00:22:37,757
I'll approve as long as you drive.

395
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:40,237
Darling, I have to. His
license has been revoked.

396
00:22:41,614 --> 00:22:43,206
Ah, let's find Judy.

397
00:22:53,676 --> 00:22:55,170
Hello Julio. How goes it?

398
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:56,642
Not bad, not good.

399
00:22:57,205 --> 00:22:59,790
But I have visited that man on
England Avenue, Eager.        ─ Yeah?

400
00:23:00,007 --> 00:23:01,766
I think he has learned
not to talk so much.

401
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,614
He has now six stitches in his head.

402
00:23:04,704 --> 00:23:06,391
There you are.
─ But, Eager ..

403
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,678
What's the beef?

404
00:23:07,876 --> 00:23:09,409
It's all that sort of a job's worth.

405
00:23:09,509 --> 00:23:11,533
But Eager, I owe lots of
people money. I can't ..

406
00:23:11,633 --> 00:23:14,463
If I give you more you'll put it on the
horses or give it to that dame of yours.

407
00:23:14,964 --> 00:23:17,010
Stop playing sucker and
then we'll talk about a deal.

408
00:23:19,515 --> 00:23:20,721
Hello, Johnny.
─ Hi.

409
00:23:20,979 --> 00:23:22,666
Did you bump into Julio?
─ Yeah.

410
00:23:23,161 --> 00:23:24,705
That Julio gives me the creeps.

411
00:23:25,162 --> 00:23:27,208
I don't mind tapping a guy
out if he's got it coming.

412
00:23:27,359 --> 00:23:29,061
But that Julio gets
a big kick out of it.

413
00:23:29,222 --> 00:23:32,147
Like every time someone gets knocked
out, there is some swell-looking dame.

414
00:23:32,289 --> 00:23:33,333
Seen Jeff Hartnett?

415
00:23:33,478 --> 00:23:34,494
Here. He's inside.

416
00:23:38,272 --> 00:23:40,318
What's this? I don't want
any of these mutts up here.

417
00:23:40,763 --> 00:23:42,481
He belongs here. He's yours.

418
00:23:43,184 --> 00:23:44,114
I don't get it.

419
00:23:44,514 --> 00:23:46,514
Do you remember Wally Heron?
─ Yeah.

420
00:23:46,673 --> 00:23:48,081
He heard you were opening here.

421
00:23:48,315 --> 00:23:51,663
Before he kicked off, he shipped down
the pooch for the grand he owes you.

422
00:23:52,404 --> 00:23:54,115
"Gypsy Prince", he calls him.

423
00:23:55,358 --> 00:23:57,790
Say, he's some dog.
Holds two world records.

424
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,843
He won the Miami Future in 33.
Earned 25 grand.

425
00:24:01,113 --> 00:24:02,938
Sure. All the boys knew
about him down below.

426
00:24:03,038 --> 00:24:04,236
They was nuts about him.

427
00:24:04,404 --> 00:24:05,737
Maybe I'll run him myself.

428
00:24:06,195 --> 00:24:07,686
Pick up a little of my own dough.

429
00:24:08,017 --> 00:24:10,389
He can't run now.
Read what it says later.

430
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:13,023
His legs are gone.
He's twelve years old.

431
00:24:13,261 --> 00:24:14,992
Sure. They die around
fourteen of fifteen.

432
00:24:15,391 --> 00:24:17,350
Then, what the devil did
Heron send him to me for?

433
00:24:17,763 --> 00:24:19,793
Like he says. Out of sentiment.

434
00:24:20,202 --> 00:24:22,051
Sentiment, huh? Since
when does that pay off?

435
00:24:22,418 --> 00:24:24,442
But boss, he only eats baby lamb chops.

436
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:27,842
Yeah, yeah. Eighty cents a pound.

437
00:24:28,529 --> 00:24:30,117
No, he'd better get used to hamburger.

438
00:24:30,558 --> 00:24:32,775
Keep him out in the kitchen.
Don't let them get rid of him.

439
00:24:38,384 --> 00:24:40,999
You wait until Johnny hears
how you've insulted me.

440
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:43,544
I looked that word up in the dictionary.

441
00:24:45,024 --> 00:24:47,719
Empress, I have incurred
your displeasure.

442
00:24:48,285 --> 00:24:51,182
I shall fall on my sword
at the first opportunity.

443
00:24:51,465 --> 00:24:52,634
You just wait!

444
00:24:52,884 --> 00:24:55,483
I'm sick and tired of your
big words and your ..

445
00:24:55,649 --> 00:24:56,693
Beat it .. beat it!

446
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:59,889
He called me an Inamorata.

447
00:25:00,234 --> 00:25:02,823
I looked it up and it means ..
─ Not smart to blow your top that way.

448
00:25:02,963 --> 00:25:06,311
You! I can't be like you. When
I'm mad, I've got to show it.

449
00:25:06,557 --> 00:25:07,986
I can't hide it the way you do.

450
00:25:08,137 --> 00:25:10,583
Well do your yelling someplace
else, sugar. I want to talk to Jeff.

451
00:25:10,825 --> 00:25:13,081
Are you going to let him
say things like that to me?

452
00:25:13,334 --> 00:25:16,623
Choose between us, Eager.
Me or your beloved.

453
00:25:16,789 --> 00:25:17,633
You shut up!

454
00:25:17,826 --> 00:25:20,624
Either he apologizes or
I walk right out of here.

455
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:21,920
Suit yourself, sugar.

456
00:25:23,214 --> 00:25:24,661
Goodbye.
─ So long.

457
00:25:37,893 --> 00:25:42,847
I seem to have offended your light
of love by using a polysyllabic word.

458
00:25:43,408 --> 00:25:44,542
You are drunk.

459
00:25:44,987 --> 00:25:48,018
Now Eager .. that's obvious.

460
00:25:48,430 --> 00:25:52,553
Very obvious. Don't be obvious. You're
out of character when you're obvious.

461
00:25:53,273 --> 00:25:54,722
Adroitness is your racket.

462
00:25:55,488 --> 00:25:56,200
Hard.

463
00:25:57,088 --> 00:26:00,119
Clever and .. adroit.
That's your description.

464
00:26:00,219 --> 00:26:01,671
Oh not again, Jeff.

465
00:26:01,824 --> 00:26:04,878
Well, just because I've said it
before doesn't mean it isn't true.

466
00:26:05,787 --> 00:26:07,980
Eager, you are a man ..

467
00:26:09,087 --> 00:26:10,342
You shouldn't be obvious.

468
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,725
Observed, analyzed and ..

469
00:26:14,582 --> 00:26:17,070
Recorded for history
because you're unique.

470
00:26:17,716 --> 00:26:19,710
Absolutely unique.

471
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,824
Here we go again, kids.

472
00:26:25,171 --> 00:26:28,008
A lot of people think
I'm just a stooge for you.

473
00:26:28,909 --> 00:26:31,220
They don't know I'm a modern Boswell.

474
00:26:31,369 --> 00:26:35,748
Meticulously recording for posterity
the doings of a unique individual.

475
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:39,138
An individual out of the
days of the Medicis.

476
00:26:39,409 --> 00:26:41,143
And .. I'm your Boswell.

477
00:26:43,151 --> 00:26:44,971
The story of Johnny Eager.

478
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:49,116
The next forty generations
will find it required reading.

479
00:26:49,283 --> 00:26:51,421
Along with the words of Machiavelli.

480
00:26:51,975 --> 00:26:53,359
And .. no .. no!

481
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,716
Am I going to have to hold your
nose and pour it down you?

482
00:26:59,064 --> 00:26:59,793
Take it.

483
00:27:08,956 --> 00:27:11,406
It is hardly the nectar of the Gods.

484
00:27:11,638 --> 00:27:13,225
You'll feel better in a few minutes.

485
00:27:13,325 --> 00:27:17,597
Yeah, but during those couple of
minutes, I'll die a thousand deaths.

486
00:27:19,537 --> 00:27:20,839
I forgot my purse.

487
00:27:21,447 --> 00:27:23,682
Oh. Well, did you find it alright?
─ Yes.

488
00:27:25,923 --> 00:27:27,997
You'd have let me walk right
out on you, wouldn't you?

489
00:27:28,273 --> 00:27:29,660
If that's the way you want it.

490
00:27:29,824 --> 00:27:31,213
You win.
─ Win?

491
00:27:31,596 --> 00:27:32,840
Win what? Were we betting?

492
00:27:33,042 --> 00:27:36,007
Oh Johnny, you're so cold-blooded,
sometimes I think ..

493
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:40,110
You think what?

494
00:27:41,525 --> 00:27:44,063
Never mind.
─ Alright. Keep secrets.

495
00:27:44,494 --> 00:27:47,525
Oh sometimes I wonder if
I mean anything at all to you.

496
00:27:48,772 --> 00:27:51,764
This town may explode on me any minute.
I've four million things to think of ..

497
00:27:51,864 --> 00:27:54,486
And you want to talk about love
at 4 o'clock in the afternoon.

498
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:57,012
Will I see you later?

499
00:27:57,627 --> 00:28:00,334
Well, I got to look around the
town a little. And I smell trouble.

500
00:28:01,158 --> 00:28:03,053
I'll phone you and drop over your place.

501
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:05,191
Good .. I'll wait.

502
00:28:06,167 --> 00:28:07,383
Bye, darling.
─ Bye bye.

503
00:28:21,361 --> 00:28:24,256
Does that young woman ever do
anything besides make exits?

504
00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:27,027
You'll wake up dead one of these days.

505
00:28:27,285 --> 00:28:29,201
Everybody does sooner or later.

506
00:28:31,345 --> 00:28:32,180
Johnny.

507
00:28:33,232 --> 00:28:34,087
A short one?

508
00:28:34,817 --> 00:28:35,528
Nix.

509
00:28:36,664 --> 00:28:38,851
Why do you keep pouring
that stuff into you?

510
00:28:39,178 --> 00:28:41,878
I've told you. Every now and
then I've got to look in a mirror.

511
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:44,878
Johnny.

512
00:28:46,750 --> 00:28:48,318
Well, I guess one won't hurt.

513
00:28:50,088 --> 00:28:52,054
Hey tell me. What do
you hear around town?

514
00:28:53,030 --> 00:28:53,902
For instance?

515
00:28:54,223 --> 00:28:57,109
I mean about Lew Rankin
suddenly getting a big head.

516
00:28:58,448 --> 00:28:59,866
He's got a big head.

517
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,349
That's why his brain rattles.

518
00:29:03,231 --> 00:29:06,003
You heard about Tony Luce running a
wheel and tables over at The Porthole?

519
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:07,206
Yeah.

520
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:12,425
I'm sorry. I went to this wingding
and forgot to check on it.

521
00:29:13,154 --> 00:29:14,863
Hey .. Johnny.

522
00:29:15,931 --> 00:29:17,624
The leaf is about to fall.

523
00:29:18,222 --> 00:29:18,945
Oh.

524
00:29:26,539 --> 00:29:27,581
Once again, maybe?

525
00:29:28,154 --> 00:29:30,751
You go and lie down. You've got
to snap out of this by tonight.

526
00:29:31,051 --> 00:29:32,923
We're calling on Mr Luce.

527
00:29:38,054 --> 00:29:39,744
Say, Jeff.
─ Sir?

528
00:29:40,542 --> 00:29:41,697
You know these things.

529
00:29:42,358 --> 00:29:43,412
That guy ..

530
00:29:43,888 --> 00:29:46,670
Cyrano .. Cyrano
De Bergerac or something?

531
00:29:47,304 --> 00:29:50,002
Does a dame really fall for the
type of chatter he gave out?

532
00:29:50,402 --> 00:29:53,059
Are you starting to
encounter literate dames?

533
00:29:53,954 --> 00:29:55,405
Who said anything about dames?

534
00:29:55,780 --> 00:29:56,747
Go on to bed.

535
00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:19,751
If you can stand at that roulette wheel
and lose over two thousand dollars ..

536
00:30:19,993 --> 00:30:23,041
You certainly can afford to buy
me a new car. I'm not going ..

537
00:30:25,152 --> 00:30:26,824
Do you wish a table, sir?
─ No.

538
00:30:36,587 --> 00:30:38,712
Just a minute, Mr Eager.
I'll tell Tony you're here.

539
00:30:40,784 --> 00:30:42,548
And if you college kids think you can ..

540
00:30:42,858 --> 00:30:43,816
Why, Johnny.

541
00:30:47,316 --> 00:30:49,749
Michelangelo did his
best work on his back.

542
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:52,503
What's the matter with you, Eager?

543
00:30:52,942 --> 00:30:55,808
What's the matter with you?
You're my friend and you slug me.

544
00:30:55,908 --> 00:30:58,033
You didn't send it in, Luce.
You're not kicking through.

545
00:30:58,133 --> 00:31:00,187
That's a perfect way to
stop being friends with me.

546
00:31:00,287 --> 00:31:02,242
But I do send in. Every week.

547
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:04,892
Yesterday night, I give
Lew Rankin five grand.

548
00:31:05,366 --> 00:31:07,216
Listen Eager, I always send in.

549
00:31:08,929 --> 00:31:09,882
Rankin, huh?

550
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:12,752
Alright then. Chase your
dame here, and we'll ..

551
00:31:12,852 --> 00:31:14,373
My dame? She's not my dame.

552
00:31:14,900 --> 00:31:17,330
Why Mr Eager, what would Cyrano say?

553
00:31:19,194 --> 00:31:21,587
Okay Tony, go out with
Jeff and spill it to him.

554
00:31:30,724 --> 00:31:32,663
There's nothing to be
frightened of, Miss Bard.

555
00:31:32,763 --> 00:31:33,977
Why, I'm not frightened.

556
00:31:34,477 --> 00:31:36,866
I would like sort-of like to ask
what you're doing here, though.

557
00:31:37,452 --> 00:31:39,183
Would <i>you</i> like to be
asked that, Mr Eager?

558
00:31:40,073 --> 00:31:43,022
You're not casing Tony for that
sociology racket of yours, are you?

559
00:31:44,060 --> 00:31:44,767
Hardly.

560
00:31:45,415 --> 00:31:48,034
The gentleman I was with this
evening became quite intoxicated.

561
00:31:48,509 --> 00:31:49,439
Drunk, in fact.

562
00:31:49,734 --> 00:31:52,985
He excused himself and wandered
away leaving a bill for 85 dollars.

563
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:56,751
Mr Luce suggested I leave some
of my jewelry as collateral.

564
00:31:57,107 --> 00:31:58,434
I couldn't see it that way.

565
00:31:59,082 --> 00:32:02,317
I tried to explain to Mr Luce that the
young man is many times a millionaire.

566
00:32:02,574 --> 00:32:04,963
And I would see that he sent a
check with a bonus in the morning.

567
00:32:06,087 --> 00:32:07,966
Mr Luce couldn't quite understand.

568
00:32:09,105 --> 00:32:09,749
Uhuh.

569
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:13,654
What are you doing here, Mr Eager?

570
00:32:15,094 --> 00:32:19,044
Well now, look Miss Bard. I know it may
seem strange after what's just happened.

571
00:32:19,259 --> 00:32:21,648
You mean you really don't want
me talking about this to Mr Verne?

572
00:32:22,099 --> 00:32:23,000
Isn't that it?

573
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:25,367
He might think you've been lying to him.

574
00:32:27,068 --> 00:32:28,490
What lovely material.

575
00:32:28,992 --> 00:32:30,294
A fine tailor cut that coat.

576
00:32:30,744 --> 00:32:34,022
Well, this is a hangover from the days
when I was in big money. Five years ago.

577
00:32:34,818 --> 00:32:35,748
Five years ago.

578
00:32:38,011 --> 00:32:39,742
I knew they were always
up to the fashion.

579
00:32:40,317 --> 00:32:42,391
But I didn't know they were
ever that far ahead of it.

580
00:32:44,307 --> 00:32:45,650
Don't lie to me, Mr Eager.

581
00:32:48,430 --> 00:32:49,161
Why not?

582
00:32:51,842 --> 00:32:53,800
Because I have no
intention of reporting you.

583
00:32:58,077 --> 00:32:59,427
I'd better take you home.

584
00:33:14,521 --> 00:33:17,201
Billiken, you go out and find a cab
for you and Jeff. I'm taking the car.

585
00:33:17,301 --> 00:33:18,116
Okay, boss.

586
00:33:18,794 --> 00:33:20,364
Where is your coat?
─ Over there.

587
00:33:20,658 --> 00:33:21,902
Get it and wait out front.

588
00:33:24,283 --> 00:33:25,871
Now you button your mouth. Understand?

589
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:27,652
Johnny, I'm your friend.

590
00:33:28,084 --> 00:33:30,444
How do I know what hat Rankin is?
─ Alright, alright. Forget it.

591
00:33:30,801 --> 00:33:31,842
Thanks, Johnny.

592
00:33:34,776 --> 00:33:35,973
So that's her, huh?

593
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,750
Are you thinking of allowing her
to play Roxanne to your Cyrano?

594
00:33:40,926 --> 00:33:42,712
Now don't pin another can on, will you.

595
00:33:43,038 --> 00:33:44,419
My last, Duchess.

596
00:33:46,171 --> 00:33:50,213
But that blessed damsel will
have you over a barrel amigo ..

597
00:33:50,313 --> 00:33:51,937
If she talks to the parole board.

598
00:33:52,368 --> 00:33:53,155
She won't.

599
00:33:57,565 --> 00:33:58,622
Mr Freud.

600
00:34:00,787 --> 00:34:01,689
Take a letter.

601
00:34:26,472 --> 00:34:27,774
So, tell me where you live.

602
00:34:28,809 --> 00:34:31,368
Holby Place, just off Marley Road.

603
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,158
Let's stop all this bush
league nonsense.

604
00:34:37,393 --> 00:34:39,428
You don't want me to take
you home and you know it.

605
00:34:43,421 --> 00:34:44,523
Of course I don't.

606
00:34:46,554 --> 00:34:48,399
Of course I don't want
you to take me home.

607
00:35:21,518 --> 00:35:22,163
Well.

608
00:35:24,035 --> 00:35:25,279
Well. Well, what happened?

609
00:35:26,512 --> 00:35:29,429
Too late. I've been to every place
in town. They're all closed now.

610
00:35:29,709 --> 00:35:32,181
Well, has that idiotic Markham
pup been back to his house yet?

611
00:35:32,347 --> 00:35:33,527
No.
─ Ha.

612
00:35:33,812 --> 00:35:35,814
Well, I suppose that's
the modern scheme.

613
00:35:36,709 --> 00:35:39,942
In my day, if a man even looked
sideways at another man's girl.

614
00:35:40,042 --> 00:35:41,601
He'd get battered on the nose for it.

615
00:35:42,190 --> 00:35:45,318
But nowadays, you hand your girl over
to another man for the entire evening.

616
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:46,948
And a drunk at that.

617
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,334
Well, I suppose that's alright
if he's a gentlemanly drunk.

618
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:53,540
You know your daughter as well
as I do. You brought her up sir.

619
00:35:54,092 --> 00:35:56,338
Then that's up to you. Why don't
you do something about her?

620
00:35:57,426 --> 00:35:59,945
Love-making isn't always correct
or gentlemanly or considerate.

621
00:36:00,379 --> 00:36:02,100
But beyond that patrician nose of yours.

622
00:36:02,305 --> 00:36:04,390
Realize that you still belong
to the animal kingdom.

623
00:36:04,490 --> 00:36:06,889
If you were a little younger sir,
you'd get a left hook for that.

624
00:36:06,989 --> 00:36:07,947
I'm in the mood.

625
00:36:09,149 --> 00:36:10,600
Stop calling me "sir".

626
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:12,141
Can't you take it?

627
00:36:12,679 --> 00:36:16,428
An Irish immigrant who dug sewers and
studied law by gaslight on the street.

628
00:36:16,528 --> 00:36:18,054
Ought to be able to take anything.

629
00:36:19,002 --> 00:36:19,903
I can take it.

630
00:36:20,289 --> 00:36:23,164
But every now and then that
word "sir" sounds supercilious.

631
00:36:24,340 --> 00:36:26,300
Yep .. everybody is right.

632
00:36:27,054 --> 00:36:30,233
You're one of the most brilliant men in
the world and one of the most unpleasant.

633
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,004
Jimmy.

634
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:33,935
Sir?

635
00:36:35,647 --> 00:36:36,434
Come here.

636
00:36:42,411 --> 00:36:44,256
I think it's about time
you and I had a drink.

637
00:36:50,263 --> 00:36:50,988
Jimmy.

638
00:36:51,899 --> 00:36:54,169
I think you love her
almost as much as I do.

639
00:36:55,013 --> 00:36:55,979
I think so.

640
00:36:57,667 --> 00:36:58,691
Here she is.

641
00:37:11,762 --> 00:37:12,660
Yes, Jimmy.

642
00:37:18,886 --> 00:37:21,068
This is Jimmy Courtney - Mr Eager.
─ How are you?

643
00:37:21,481 --> 00:37:24,701
Floyd vanished. Left me with the check.
Mr Eager got me out of a lot of trouble.

644
00:37:25,152 --> 00:37:28,040
Please come in. It was the silliest
thing. I waited for Floyd for ..

645
00:37:29,893 --> 00:37:32,597
Hello, father. You shouldn't
have waited up. I'm alright.

646
00:37:33,583 --> 00:37:36,163
I'd like you to meet Mr Eager.
My father - Mr Farrell.

647
00:37:37,070 --> 00:37:39,101
Your father?
─ Stepfather.

648
00:37:40,284 --> 00:37:41,214
Why, of course.

649
00:37:41,472 --> 00:37:43,699
I guess everyone knows
John Benson Farrell.

650
00:37:43,941 --> 00:37:45,169
Especially you, eh Eager?

651
00:37:45,889 --> 00:37:47,477
We are acquaintances of long standing.

652
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:51,822
I had the pleasure to help prepare the
case that put Eager in the Penitentiary.

653
00:37:52,654 --> 00:37:54,144
For not as long as he deserved.

654
00:37:55,502 --> 00:37:57,998
I served as special
prosecutor, without fee.

655
00:37:58,388 --> 00:37:59,575
As a public service.

656
00:38:00,196 --> 00:38:01,778
To rid this city of vermin.

657
00:38:03,215 --> 00:38:04,092
Oh now, Dad.

658
00:38:06,262 --> 00:38:07,180
Goodnight.

659
00:38:10,005 --> 00:38:10,782
Lisbeth.

660
00:38:12,245 --> 00:38:13,890
I want to talk to you before you retire.

661
00:38:14,899 --> 00:38:16,775
Goodnight, Jimmy.
─ Goodnight, sir.

662
00:38:31,783 --> 00:38:32,613
Jimmy.

663
00:38:35,233 --> 00:38:36,907
You don't have to say anything, Lisbeth.

664
00:38:37,391 --> 00:38:38,167
I ..

665
00:38:38,967 --> 00:38:40,927
Guess I hadn't better come
around anymore, right?

666
00:38:43,066 --> 00:38:44,539
You're going to get hurt you know.

667
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,407
No Jimmy, I don't know.

668
00:38:48,581 --> 00:38:49,339
Sure?

669
00:38:51,326 --> 00:38:53,248
As sure as my heart is
beating like everything.

670
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:56,272
Good luck, Lisbeth.

671
00:39:21,050 --> 00:39:22,416
Hiya.
─ Hi, boss.

672
00:39:22,808 --> 00:39:24,640
Bacon and eggs over, easy?
─ Swell.

673
00:39:25,473 --> 00:39:27,844
Hey, what's the mutt doing in here?
Keep him out in the kitchen.

674
00:39:27,944 --> 00:39:28,816
Come on, boy.

675
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,542
Well, did you break your
finger and can't dial a phone?

676
00:39:33,726 --> 00:39:34,616
Hello, sugar.

677
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:38,814
In case your memory is bad, you were
going to stop by and call last night.

678
00:39:39,652 --> 00:39:40,897
You know I worry.

679
00:39:41,648 --> 00:39:44,435
You know, you're a character that
can always have an accident.

680
00:39:44,535 --> 00:39:46,496
Billiken, bring another
cup for Garnet will you.

681
00:39:46,596 --> 00:39:47,643
Okay boss, sure.

682
00:39:48,512 --> 00:39:52,510
I sat by the phone wondering if you were
lying somewhere full of bullet holes.

683
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:55,185
Why didn't you call?
─ Well, I forgot all about it.

684
00:39:55,889 --> 00:39:58,135
But I'm glad you dropped over,
sugar. I want to talk to you.

685
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:03,149
Hangover?

686
00:40:05,026 --> 00:40:07,959
Not in the least.
I feel like fighting Joe Louis.

687
00:40:08,152 --> 00:40:11,101
Or adopting any other
quick form of suicide.

688
00:40:16,078 --> 00:40:16,836
Now look.

689
00:40:17,551 --> 00:40:20,283
This town is sizzling sugar, and I'm
going to have to walk awful soft.

690
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:24,205
This new Prosecutor will make things so
tough, I'll have to keep moving like ..

691
00:40:24,388 --> 00:40:26,131
Like a white mouse in a revolving cage.

692
00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:28,528
So here is what I want you to do.

693
00:40:28,774 --> 00:40:30,791
You beat it down to Florida
for two or three months.

694
00:40:30,934 --> 00:40:32,550
Things should have cooled off by then.

695
00:40:32,901 --> 00:40:34,918
I'll fly down for a weekend
any time I can get away.

696
00:40:35,547 --> 00:40:36,653
Johnny.
─ Hmm?

697
00:40:37,207 --> 00:40:38,312
Is this the blow-off?

698
00:40:39,347 --> 00:40:40,105
Blow-off?

699
00:40:40,241 --> 00:40:42,358
If that's what it is,
don't lie to me, Johnny.

700
00:40:42,831 --> 00:40:44,148
I know there's another girl.

701
00:40:44,248 --> 00:40:46,795
I could tell it the minute I saw that
look on your face this morning.

702
00:40:47,358 --> 00:40:48,913
I've seen it there often enough.

703
00:40:49,446 --> 00:40:51,418
You always think the worst
of everybody, Johnny.

704
00:40:52,195 --> 00:40:55,005
Maybe you figured if you tossed me out,
I'd squeal to the Parole Board.

705
00:40:55,552 --> 00:40:58,064
I wouldn't do that, Johnny.
You know I'm stuck.

706
00:40:58,329 --> 00:40:59,826
No matter what you do, Johnny.

707
00:40:59,926 --> 00:41:02,189
It would kill me to think of
you back up there in that cell.

708
00:41:03,547 --> 00:41:06,974
I got 8 million bits of grief and now my
dame is going to throw a wingding on me.

709
00:41:09,044 --> 00:41:10,898
Johnny, you still love me?
─ Sure.

710
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:12,463
Well, say it.
─ I love you.

711
00:41:13,485 --> 00:41:14,861
Oh I'm sorry, Johnny.

712
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:17,021
I wouldn't add anything
to your troubles.

713
00:41:17,402 --> 00:41:18,943
I'll wait for you in Florida.

714
00:41:19,406 --> 00:41:20,565
There, that's the girl.

715
00:41:20,924 --> 00:41:23,179
All that nonsense out of your head?
─ Okay, boss.

716
00:41:24,133 --> 00:41:25,905
There is a train at noon.
─ I'll make it.

717
00:41:28,041 --> 00:41:30,767
You'll have a beautiful tan by
the time I get down there, darling.

718
00:41:31,633 --> 00:41:32,958
Some more coffee, Jeff?

719
00:41:33,748 --> 00:41:35,235
Get me a bottle of brandy.

720
00:41:36,257 --> 00:41:37,577
Brandy, but Eager said ..

721
00:41:37,677 --> 00:41:39,750
Get me a bottle of brandy.

722
00:41:44,792 --> 00:41:46,902
Ah, why do dames always get so messy?

723
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,108
Don't blow away the mist of love.

724
00:41:52,207 --> 00:41:55,080
Don't dust me from your list, my love.

725
00:41:57,142 --> 00:41:58,132
That's my heart.

726
00:41:59,185 --> 00:42:00,541
I know another quotation.

727
00:42:01,738 --> 00:42:04,331
I can smile and while I smile.

728
00:42:06,050 --> 00:42:08,283
Cuts your heart out with a bloody ax.

729
00:42:10,048 --> 00:42:11,371
That's from Shakespeare.

730
00:42:12,024 --> 00:42:14,681
I'll use an ax on you one of these
days if you don't stop ribbing me.

731
00:42:15,946 --> 00:42:18,124
Who is the new one? That Bard kid?

732
00:42:19,107 --> 00:42:20,730
That stuff makes you nosy, doesn't it.

733
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:24,279
Poor Garnet. She'll hang around
in Florida eating her heart out.

734
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:28,150
Until it finally dawns on her
that Lancelot is not coming.

735
00:42:30,539 --> 00:42:33,326
Johnny, why didn't you tell
her the truth, the poor kid?

736
00:42:33,715 --> 00:42:35,808
Poor Garnet? I thought
you didn't like her.

737
00:42:36,331 --> 00:42:37,082
I don't.

738
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:39,302
Well then, why do
you feel sorry for her?

739
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:43,415
Well Johnny, you can feel sorry
for someone you don't like.

740
00:42:43,609 --> 00:42:46,247
If you've got a heart
or a soul or decency.

741
00:42:50,143 --> 00:42:52,688
But I guess you don't know
what I'm talking about.

742
00:42:53,515 --> 00:42:55,790
Sometimes I wonder
why I keep you around.

743
00:42:56,637 --> 00:42:58,081
Sometimes, I wonder too.

744
00:42:59,614 --> 00:43:03,662
One day, you'll to be picking me apart
and I'll slap you in between your ears.

745
00:43:04,323 --> 00:43:07,164
My condition renders
me immune to assault.

746
00:43:08,259 --> 00:43:11,114
Now, listen .. I'm going to
get you told once and for all.

747
00:43:11,214 --> 00:43:14,871
And you stop running me through a ringer
or analysis or whatever you call it.

748
00:43:15,529 --> 00:43:17,545
You always say I don't
understand a thing or other.

749
00:43:17,645 --> 00:43:19,962
Well, you're the guy that don't
understand as you're a sucker.

750
00:43:20,062 --> 00:43:21,912
And a sucker never
understands a smart guy.

751
00:43:22,448 --> 00:43:24,953
If you weren't a chump for booze,
you'd be a chump for a dame.

752
00:43:25,053 --> 00:43:28,938
Be half-decent and pure about it until
she walks off with a bald-headed banker.

753
00:43:29,038 --> 00:43:30,597
And sent you back on the booze again.

754
00:43:32,533 --> 00:43:34,696
And you're the guy that has pals, too.

755
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,943
You'd give your best pal your
last fifty bucks, wouldn't you.

756
00:43:38,043 --> 00:43:40,284
He's already a dead duck
or he wouldn't need the fifty.

757
00:43:40,384 --> 00:43:43,027
And he's spent it, you're both
free from hunger. So what?

758
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,663
Sure, the suckers all give me sour
looks. The minute they stop ..

759
00:43:47,051 --> 00:43:49,753
I'm worried, see. Because then
I know I'm not on my toes.

760
00:43:51,055 --> 00:43:52,439
And that's where I'm staying.

761
00:43:53,161 --> 00:43:56,589
Ready to hit the first guy that's fool
enough to cross me in the first place.

762
00:43:58,899 --> 00:44:01,037
Now I know why you keep
me around, Johnny.

763
00:44:02,196 --> 00:44:03,040
You do, huh?

764
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:05,100
Well tell me. I'd sure like to know.

765
00:44:06,676 --> 00:44:10,350
You keep me around because even
Johnny Eager has to have one friend.

766
00:44:11,686 --> 00:44:12,656
[ Telephone ]

767
00:44:13,035 --> 00:44:14,935
Yeah? Oh hello, Ed.

768
00:44:15,296 --> 00:44:16,772
Yeah, yeah. He's right here.

769
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:20,292
It's Ed Nolan. Says it's important.

770
00:44:20,594 --> 00:44:21,510
You're nuts.

771
00:44:22,758 --> 00:44:24,221
Hello, Ed.
─ Listen, Johnny.

772
00:44:24,321 --> 00:44:25,757
There was a phone-call for you.

773
00:44:25,857 --> 00:44:28,274
Of course I told them you was out
on a long trip like I always do.

774
00:44:28,646 --> 00:44:31,464
But you could have knocked me down with
a feather when I find out who wants you.

775
00:44:31,745 --> 00:44:33,504
Why, you couldn't guess
in a million years.

776
00:44:33,786 --> 00:44:36,259
Sure I can guess. John Benson Farrell.

777
00:44:37,210 --> 00:44:37,981
Right.

778
00:44:38,486 --> 00:44:39,215
Farrell?

779
00:44:39,929 --> 00:44:42,391
Johnny, what's up?
─ Nothing I can't handle.

780
00:44:52,136 --> 00:44:54,978
Sorry I didn't get your message sooner,
Mr Farrell but I was out on a long haul.

781
00:44:55,078 --> 00:44:56,284
Save your breath, thief.

782
00:44:58,044 --> 00:45:00,014
I called you down here
to tell you one thing.

783
00:45:00,497 --> 00:45:02,056
I'm going to make it short and sweet.

784
00:45:03,260 --> 00:45:04,827
Don't go near my daughter again.

785
00:45:05,292 --> 00:45:06,393
Don't try to see her.

786
00:45:06,886 --> 00:45:08,417
Don't write her and don't phone her.

787
00:45:09,349 --> 00:45:10,193
Now get out.

788
00:45:10,575 --> 00:45:11,809
Well this is marvelous.

789
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:15,126
I do you a favor and help your daughter
out of a spot and you declare war on me.

790
00:45:15,689 --> 00:45:16,791
That's for the favor.

791
00:45:17,952 --> 00:45:19,225
Now pick it up and get out!

792
00:45:19,679 --> 00:45:22,050
And remember what I told you .. thief!

793
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,124
You mean ex-thief.

794
00:45:24,578 --> 00:45:25,508
Get out, thief.

795
00:45:26,896 --> 00:45:29,428
It would be much simpler if you just
told your daughter not to see me.

796
00:45:31,554 --> 00:45:32,684
You did tell her that.

797
00:45:33,473 --> 00:45:34,574
And what did she say?

798
00:45:35,728 --> 00:45:36,972
What did she say, Farrell?

799
00:45:37,604 --> 00:45:39,047
Don't push me too far, Eager.

800
00:45:39,267 --> 00:45:42,628
The big-shot John Benson Farrell doesn't
like his daughter knowing a cab driver.

801
00:45:43,973 --> 00:45:47,214
There's no law against my seeing a girl
as long as it's alright with the girl.

802
00:45:47,728 --> 00:45:50,214
Your visit to Stateville didn't
teach you very much, did it.

803
00:45:50,648 --> 00:45:53,582
Look, Farrell. There isn't a thing you
can do. My parole record is clear.

804
00:45:54,018 --> 00:45:56,108
Wouldn't it be odd if you
were picked up on suspicion?

805
00:45:56,376 --> 00:45:58,283
I'd be out on the street
in an hour. I'm clean.

806
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:00,665
But wouldn't it be odd if a gun
was found in your pocket?

807
00:46:03,639 --> 00:46:04,863
It can happen you know.

808
00:46:05,972 --> 00:46:07,818
The Cops in this town dislike me a lot.

809
00:46:09,018 --> 00:46:11,517
You would frame me?
─ Why certainly I would.

810
00:46:12,148 --> 00:46:13,192
You'd turn crooked?

811
00:46:13,388 --> 00:46:15,010
You made the typical thief's mistake.

812
00:46:16,448 --> 00:46:18,872
You banked too much on
an honest man's honesty.

813
00:46:19,868 --> 00:46:23,231
Sure, I'd resign my job
tomorrow to frame you myself.

814
00:46:24,384 --> 00:46:26,165
I'd frame you or kill you!

815
00:46:27,614 --> 00:46:29,095
If it would protect my daughter.

816
00:46:31,066 --> 00:46:31,910
Now get out.

817
00:46:37,551 --> 00:46:38,195
Wait.

818
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:42,159
Pick that up.

819
00:46:49,584 --> 00:46:50,500
Pick that up!

820
00:47:11,326 --> 00:47:12,670
Cab?
─ Where to, sir?

821
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:14,606
Algonquin Park.
─ Yes, sir.

822
00:47:20,507 --> 00:47:21,408
What happened?

823
00:47:21,645 --> 00:47:23,646
Ah, he's a little touchy
about his daughter.

824
00:47:24,021 --> 00:47:26,034
He hasn't got a leg to
stand on. I told him so.

825
00:47:26,255 --> 00:47:28,505
Listen Johnny, this is no
good. She is dangerous.

826
00:47:29,084 --> 00:47:31,589
Besides, it isn't like you to
blow your top over some dame.

827
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,971
Especially when things are
going haywire, Johnny.

828
00:47:34,509 --> 00:47:35,668
The boys tailed Rankin.

829
00:47:36,242 --> 00:47:37,744
He spent all morning with Halligan.

830
00:47:38,434 --> 00:47:40,279
There is a big crosseroo on,
sure as anything.

831
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:42,575
You got to do something
right away, Johnny.

832
00:47:43,439 --> 00:47:45,303
I'll pick my own time
to take care of Rankin.

833
00:47:45,727 --> 00:47:47,944
Right now I've got something
more important to think about.

834
00:47:48,168 --> 00:47:49,857
You mean .. that dame?

835
00:47:50,604 --> 00:47:51,391
That dame.

836
00:47:52,358 --> 00:47:53,375
Not bad, huh?

837
00:47:59,755 --> 00:48:01,530
Good evening, Billiken.
─ Hello Miss Bard.

838
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:03,790
The boss will in a minute.
─ Thank you .. here, Gypsy.

839
00:48:05,297 --> 00:48:06,897
Look what I've got for you.

840
00:48:07,554 --> 00:48:08,486
Wait a minute.

841
00:48:09,146 --> 00:48:10,476
Here you are. Look, a rabbit!

842
00:48:11,142 --> 00:48:11,929
Go get it.

843
00:48:14,548 --> 00:48:16,731
It reminds you of the old
days, doesn't it boy. Here.

844
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:19,872
Hello, sugar.

845
00:48:22,015 --> 00:48:24,388
Hey, what's this?
─ It's a rabbit, silly.

846
00:48:24,687 --> 00:48:26,374
To remind the old warrior of the woods.

847
00:48:26,474 --> 00:48:28,148
He wants you to throw it for him.
─ Why?

848
00:48:28,510 --> 00:48:31,116
Well, so he can chase it.
─ What's his percentage in that?

849
00:48:31,334 --> 00:48:33,298
There is no percentage.
He just likes it.

850
00:48:33,959 --> 00:48:34,903
Throw it again.

851
00:48:35,003 --> 00:48:38,284
Nix. Just because he's not bright is no
reason I should waste my time too.

852
00:48:38,469 --> 00:48:40,324
Say, Billiken. Take him
out into the kitchen.

853
00:48:40,424 --> 00:48:42,896
Okay, boss. Come on. Come on.

854
00:48:44,110 --> 00:48:46,342
Oh and you can beat it now.
I won't need you tonight.

855
00:48:46,547 --> 00:48:48,244
Goodnight, boss.
─ Goodnight, Billiken.

856
00:48:48,344 --> 00:48:50,046
Goodnight, Miss Bard.
─ Goodnight, Gypsy.

857
00:48:52,505 --> 00:48:53,873
Want a drink.
─ No thank you.

858
00:48:58,611 --> 00:49:00,797
You don't know very much
about dogs, do you Johnny.

859
00:49:01,262 --> 00:49:02,392
Nope. Never had a dog.

860
00:49:05,385 --> 00:49:06,953
You poor darling.
─ Huh?

861
00:49:07,833 --> 00:49:09,993
You never had a dog when you were a boy.

862
00:49:10,622 --> 00:49:11,723
That's dreadful.

863
00:49:12,188 --> 00:49:14,498
Listen .. there are a
million things I never had.

864
00:49:14,757 --> 00:49:16,878
That I needed a lot more than
a dog, when I was a kid.

865
00:49:19,167 --> 00:49:22,808
Yes, but it sort-of tells the
story of Johnny Eager so ..

866
00:49:23,917 --> 00:49:25,075
So completely.

867
00:49:26,934 --> 00:49:28,580
He never had a dog when he was a boy.

868
00:49:31,186 --> 00:49:33,972
Someday a man will come along
and put you in a zipper bag.

869
00:49:35,445 --> 00:49:37,661
I don't worry about what I
missed when I was a kid.

870
00:49:39,168 --> 00:49:40,969
I'm getting all those things now.

871
00:49:46,945 --> 00:49:48,533
But you miss something, Johnny.

872
00:49:49,474 --> 00:49:50,976
That's why you are the way you are.

873
00:49:53,902 --> 00:49:56,078
Darling, where do we get off?

874
00:49:57,338 --> 00:49:58,526
What is to become of us?

875
00:49:59,812 --> 00:50:03,385
Oh now don't turn ordinary on me.
I get tired of ordinary dames.

876
00:50:05,171 --> 00:50:06,902
And I don't ever want
to get tired of you.

877
00:50:09,203 --> 00:50:11,693
I didn't mean to turn
ordinary on you, Johnny.

878
00:50:12,907 --> 00:50:15,747
It was just an approach to
get you to say you loved me.

879
00:50:18,058 --> 00:50:18,919
Listen.

880
00:50:19,510 --> 00:50:22,398
Anytime you start doubting I
love you, just tote up the score.

881
00:50:23,436 --> 00:50:26,168
This town is full of women and I have
to pick the most dangerous one in town.

882
00:50:26,471 --> 00:50:28,668
The one woman most likely
to upset my apple cart.

883
00:50:29,805 --> 00:50:32,208
You know, this time it might
not be the woman who pays.

884
00:50:33,007 --> 00:50:34,435
I might wind up back in a cell.

885
00:50:36,623 --> 00:50:37,374
Johnny.

886
00:50:38,748 --> 00:50:41,022
Johnny, I never doubted for one
moment that you loved me.

887
00:50:42,092 --> 00:50:42,764
Never.

888
00:50:44,273 --> 00:50:46,383
Don't talk about that horrible place.

889
00:50:47,941 --> 00:50:49,402
You're never going back there.

890
00:50:54,412 --> 00:50:56,257
Hey Billiken, I thought
I told you to beat it.

891
00:50:56,359 --> 00:50:58,963
It's not Billiken, Eager.
It's me, Julio.

892
00:51:02,598 --> 00:51:05,519
Have you blown your topper?
─ No Eager, I haven't blown my topper.

893
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,001
You are playing me for a sucker.
Julio don't like that.

894
00:51:08,557 --> 00:51:10,394
Let's talk sense now.
─ Now, wait a minute.

895
00:51:10,494 --> 00:51:11,614
Step aside, sister.

896
00:51:12,105 --> 00:51:14,007
Eager, this time you'll get yours.

897

The daffy chump. I wonder
what was eating him.

903

We got a break. It looks like
nobody heard. Come on.

904

A doctor.

905
00:51:56,179 --> 00:51:57,595
He's long past needing a doctor.

906
00:51:57,774 --> 00:51:59,705
We've got to get out of
here. I'll get your coat.

907
00:52:06,686 --> 00:52:08,713
Come on.
─ We can't leave him like this.

908
00:52:08,884 --> 00:52:10,555
You want to wind up on trial for murder?

909
00:52:10,655 --> 00:52:12,576
But he's badly hurt and
maybe we can help him.

910
00:52:12,676 --> 00:52:14,648
Worse, he's dying.
I've seen enough to know.

911
00:52:14,748 --> 00:52:15,820
You get out of here.

912
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:18,465
I can't Johnny. I just can't run
off and leave a dying man.

913
00:52:18,708 --> 00:52:20,071
It's a fine time to unravel.

914

You'll put yourself right in the grease.
You're putting me back in Stateville.

No.

916
00:52:27,360 --> 00:52:29,092
No, I couldn't stand that.

917
00:52:30,421 --> 00:52:31,310
I'll go.

918
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:34,936
Take me home, Johnny.

I've got to get rid of that.

921

Hey, Jeff.

922
00:52:53,327 --> 00:52:55,336
I should be on the stage.
I'm a good actor, huh?

923
00:52:56,088 --> 00:52:57,495
Well that's a moot question.

924
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,620
On the stage or on the gallows.

925
00:53:01,737 --> 00:53:03,599
Eager will not mind if
I borrow a shirt, huh?

926
00:53:03,831 --> 00:53:07,000

Yeah, Marco.

930
00:53:20,895 --> 00:53:22,449
That doesn't sound very good.

931
00:53:24,179 --> 00:53:25,795
Yeah, I'll tell him when he comes back.

932
00:53:32,894 --> 00:53:34,223
Did you get her off alright?

933
00:53:34,323 --> 00:53:36,168
Yeah, I put her in a cab.
─ How'd she take it?

934
00:53:36,366 --> 00:53:38,318
Pretty rough. She's
shaking like a dice-box.

935
00:53:39,689 --> 00:53:40,733
It's a funny thing.

936
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:42,829
I feel bad about giving
her this kind of a deal.

937
00:53:43,513 --> 00:53:45,728
I can't imagine why.
─ Neither can I.

938
00:53:46,399 --> 00:53:48,044
Maybe because she didn't have it coming.

939
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:51,690
Well .. it's always the innocent
bystander that gets shot.

940

That crack doesn't fit this spot.

Yeah, she is that.

943
00:53:58,520 --> 00:54:01,306
I wonder why I feel different about her.
You know, different from the rest.

944
00:54:02,763 --> 00:54:04,637
Maybe because she didn't
want anything from me.

945
00:54:05,432 --> 00:54:07,993
And there wasn't any other way to
play the hand, and we've got to live.

00:59:14,180 --> 00:59:16,428
No I'm not. The Planters
been closed for months.

1015
00:59:16,528 --> 00:59:18,314
That's not what I hear
so we'll take a look.

1016
00:59:18,414 --> 00:59:20,496
If it's closed, I'll apologize.
If there is gambling ..

1017
00:59:20,596 --> 00:59:23,022
You'll leave the state, as you've
earned your last dollar here.

1018
00:59:23,122 --> 00:59:24,423
Fair enough?
─ Fair enough.

1019
00:59:24,636 --> 00:59:26,357
I'm sure going to enjoy that apology.

1020
00:59:26,656 --> 00:59:27,385
Roll it.

1021
00:59:44,019 --> 00:59:46,403
You can see, the
joint is running full blast.

1022
00:59:46,853 --> 00:59:48,641
Maybe it just looks that.
Let's take a look.

1023
00:59:57,518 --> 00:59:58,648
Where is that apology?

1024
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:02,065
You've got it. I feel like a chump.

1025
01:00:02,775 --> 01:00:04,649
Go back to town.
I'll buy you a bottle of wine.

1026
01:00:04,974 --> 01:00:06,592
Oh .. here's your gun.

1027
01:00:07,721 --> 01:00:09,563
I feel kinda silly.
─ You should.

1028
01:00:13,007 --> 01:00:15,167
You can beat it, Julio. I won't
need you anymore tonight.

1029
01:00:15,969 --> 01:00:17,529
Go ahead, Lew. You’re driving.

1030
01:00:26,509 --> 01:00:29,649
I'm going to make you buy that wine
in the most expensive joint in town.

1031
01:00:30,862 --> 01:00:35,575
Figuring me for a cross after all that
we've double up on since we were kids.

1032
01:00:35,872 --> 01:00:37,390
Well anybody can be wrong, Lew.

1033
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:40,321
This time it's you, Johnny .. move!

1034
01:00:41,767 --> 01:00:43,160
So you were on the cross, huh?

1035
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:45,279
Sure. Why should I take
a second cut of the dough?

1036
01:00:45,870 --> 01:00:48,433
Get out .. I don't want
to mess up the cushion.

1037
01:00:49,519 --> 01:00:51,854
Well, I found out what I wanted to know.
─ Now you know.

1038
01:00:54,832 --> 01:00:56,489
I'll bet you could use these, Lew.

1039
01:00:58,932 --> 01:00:59,719
Why you ..

1040
01:01:06,774 --> 01:01:08,057
You must have hit him hard.

1041
01:01:08,157 --> 01:01:10,160
I had to. He'd have had
that shiv in my gizzard.

1042
01:01:10,260 --> 01:01:12,076
Go on back to the car.
I'll take care of him.

1043
01:01:55,029 --> 01:01:57,615
[ Off ]
"<i>Four .. three Aces showing</i>."

1044
01:02:10,939 --> 01:02:12,837
Well, here is our sleeping beauty.

1045
01:02:13,105 --> 01:02:14,206
How you feel, Johnny?

1046
01:02:14,374 --> 01:02:15,380
Like the rat.

1047
01:02:16,581 --> 01:02:17,682
My head is clear now.

1048
01:02:18,387 --> 01:02:20,616
Give me a double stack and
get ready to weep, you wolves.

1049
01:02:20,716 --> 01:02:23,195
Clipping me while
I was stiff. Fine pals.

1050
01:02:34,291 --> 01:02:35,392
Your Ace bets, Eager.

1051
01:02:35,750 --> 01:02:38,171
It'll cost you a thousand
to see the next car, men.

1052
01:02:39,149 --> 01:02:40,021
I feel lucky.

1053
01:02:41,618 --> 01:02:43,717
Just a minute.
─ It's important. I've got to see bill.

1054
01:02:44,113 --> 01:02:44,886
Alright.

1055
01:02:46,779 --> 01:02:47,967
The last card, gents.

1056
01:02:48,820 --> 01:02:50,792
You're still high, Eager.
─ I'll tempt myself.

1057
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:54,655
Three suckers, huh?
Well, what have you got?

1058
01:02:55,007 --> 01:02:56,921
Lew Rankin's just been killed.
─ Rankin?

1059
01:02:57,204 --> 01:02:59,841
An automobile accident.
He drove his car right off a viaduct.

1060
01:03:00,071 --> 01:03:01,234
He was drunk I guess.

1061
01:03:01,476 --> 01:03:04,594
Anyway, he smelt of whiskey and there
was an empty pint bottle in his car.

1062
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:08,189
Poor Lew. I saw him just yesterday.
─ A great guy.

1063
01:03:09,210 --> 01:03:10,346
A pint of whiskey.

1064
01:03:14,249 --> 01:03:16,569
A pint of whiskey.
─ Poor Lew.

1065
01:03:20,344 --> 01:03:22,616
I guess this is the best
alibi anybody ever had.

1066
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:25,015
Nobody could ask me anything about Lew.

1067
01:03:25,257 --> 01:03:28,115
At the time it happened I was
playing poker with the city boss.

1068
01:03:29,043 --> 01:03:31,169
And a flock of the boss's
influential friends.

1069
01:03:31,634 --> 01:03:33,344
I had no idea it was getting so late.

1070
01:03:34,888 --> 01:03:37,287
I guess you other fellows didn't
know it was so late either, huh?

1071
01:03:37,387 --> 01:03:38,946
Yeah, that's right.
─ Wait a minute.

1072
01:03:41,731 --> 01:03:43,473
Looks like I win. Three Jacks.

1073
01:03:45,930 --> 01:03:47,610
Hey Jeff, get my hat and coat will you?

1074
01:03:47,946 --> 01:03:49,053
Hey look Johnny, I ..

1075
01:03:50,518 --> 01:03:51,991
I'm opening the track on Saturday.

1076
01:03:53,049 --> 01:03:54,809
Your end is ten percent
instead of thirty.

1077
01:03:56,016 --> 01:03:57,718
Maybe you'd like to
beef about that, huh?

1078
01:03:59,909 --> 01:04:00,810
I thought not.

1079
01:04:01,666 --> 01:04:02,538
Come on Jeff.

1080
01:04:13,246 --> 01:04:14,061
Eager here?

1081
01:04:14,425 --> 01:04:15,507
Who?
─ Eager.

1082
01:04:15,908 --> 01:04:17,900
I don't know.
─ He sent for me. To meet him here.

1083
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,416
John Benson Farrell. Go on, tell him.

1084
01:04:23,408 --> 01:04:25,225
Say, there's a guy out
here who says he's ..

1085
01:04:27,246 --> 01:04:28,204
Yeah, it is him.

1086
01:04:29,591 --> 01:04:30,457
Okay, boss.

1087
01:04:32,424 --> 01:04:34,469
Well, what do you know? He says come in.

1088
01:04:40,338 --> 01:04:41,526
Hello, Farrell.

1089
01:04:42,667 --> 01:04:43,654
Do you like that?

1090
01:04:44,072 --> 01:04:46,203
We're going to put these on
billboards after we open up.

1091
01:04:46,357 --> 01:04:47,287
Saturday night.

1092
01:04:47,793 --> 01:04:48,665
So that's it.

1093
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:50,936
You're a bigger thief than ever.

1094
01:04:51,949 --> 01:04:54,064
That's it.
─ My instinct was right.

1095
01:04:55,048 --> 01:04:59,244
You can't stop being a thief more than
a weasel can stop sucking chicken blood.

1096
01:05:00,253 --> 01:05:02,664
You're in no spot to talk down
to me, Farrell. So don't.

1097
01:05:03,054 --> 01:05:04,270
We will cover that later.

1098
01:05:05,127 --> 01:05:06,782
What happened to my daughter last night?

1099
01:05:08,299 --> 01:05:09,422
Okay Jeff, this one.

1100
01:05:11,134 --> 01:05:13,194
Only make that "S" look
like a dollar sign, huh.

1101
01:05:14,426 --> 01:05:15,979
What happened to Lisbeth last night?

1102
01:05:17,729 --> 01:05:19,460
Let's go in there where
we can spread out.

1103
01:05:21,091 --> 01:05:22,335
What did she say happened?

1104
01:05:24,530 --> 01:05:25,975
I couldn't get a word out of her.

1105
01:05:26,479 --> 01:05:28,045
I came downstairs early this morning.

1106
01:05:28,323 --> 01:05:30,940
And there she was sitting in
the dark, staring straight ahead.

1107
01:05:31,788 --> 01:05:33,157
She wouldn't talk or couldn't.

1108
01:05:34,296 --> 01:05:36,218
I called a doctor, but
it didn't do any good.

1109
01:05:37,546 --> 01:05:39,521
She even refused to
take a sleeping potion.

1110
01:05:41,356 --> 01:05:42,622
She's in a bad way, Eager.

1111
01:05:43,399 --> 01:05:46,106
And if you've done anything to ..
─ She'll be alright in a couple of days.

1112
01:05:46,624 --> 01:05:47,840
She's not in any trouble.

1113
01:05:48,745 --> 01:05:50,037
I'm covering up for her.

1114
01:05:51,110 --> 01:05:53,098
You're the one that's in
trouble, Farrell. Wake up.

1115
01:05:55,227 --> 01:05:56,071
Covering up?

1116
01:05:56,529 --> 01:05:57,516
What do you mean?

1117
01:05:57,649 --> 01:06:00,442
Lisbeth was here last night.
Don't get holy. It’s not the first time.

1118
01:06:01,414 --> 01:06:03,860
Yeah, a guy I knew busted in
gunning for me. It was quite a battle.

1119
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:08,017
As he was trying to carve me up, Lisbeth
shot him in the back with his own gun.

1120
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:12,064
Do you blame me for covering
for her? She saved my hide.

1121
01:06:12,555 --> 01:06:13,571
It isn't possible.

1122
01:06:14,110 --> 01:06:16,025
Lisbeth?
─ You saw her face, didn't you?

1123
01:06:16,788 --> 01:06:17,660
Quite a mess.

1124
01:06:18,861 --> 01:06:20,048
What became of the body?

1125
01:06:20,523 --> 01:06:23,398
If it comes to light it won't be where
it bothers anyone. Count on me for that.

1126
01:06:23,537 --> 01:06:25,848
Any witnesses?
─ None I can't handle.

1127
01:06:27,633 --> 01:06:30,136
I sent for you to tell you to sit tight.
Tell Lisbeth to do the same.

1128
01:06:30,404 --> 01:06:32,278
One hoodlum more or less
doesn't matter anyway.

1129
01:06:32,747 --> 01:06:33,734
Where is the gun?

1130
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:36,615
Oh, I've got that safe with
her fingerprints on it.

1131
01:06:36,999 --> 01:06:39,546
Just in case you might try to think
of some way to pin it on to me.

1132
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:42,906
Well, I haven't any choice.

1133
01:06:43,985 --> 01:06:45,172
I'll have to keep quiet.

1134
01:06:46,662 --> 01:06:48,135
You'll do more than that, Farrell.

1135
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:51,869
You'll have the injunction on this track
lifted. I'm opening up Saturday night.

1136
01:06:53,851 --> 01:06:54,962
Listen to me, thief.

1137
01:06:55,969 --> 01:06:58,424
My love for my daughter makes
me an accessory after the fact.

1138
01:06:59,061 --> 01:07:01,610
But I'll cut my throat before
I become an accomplice.

1139
01:07:02,321 --> 01:07:04,576
I'll resign as Prosecutor today.
─ No you won't.

1140
01:07:05,498 --> 01:07:09,184
You say you'd go crooked for Lisbeth.
Never had a better chance than now.

1141
01:07:09,307 --> 01:07:11,560
You mean that you'd ..?
─ Yes, I'd blast the whole thing.

1142
01:07:13,112 --> 01:07:14,463
You would do that to her?

1143
01:07:15,252 --> 01:07:17,335
To a girl that loved you
enough to kill a man?

1144
01:07:18,484 --> 01:07:20,500
I don't know about that
love routine. It's business.

1145
01:07:20,600 --> 01:07:23,950
You'll only go back to the Penitentiary.
─ Sure, I risk 5 more years in the can.

1146
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:28,388
But I'm betting you'll see things my way
and I think I'm betting on the favorite.

1147
01:07:33,318 --> 01:07:34,054
Alright.

1148
01:07:36,916 --> 01:07:38,530
Go ahead. Open up Saturday night.

1149
01:07:39,319 --> 01:07:41,230
I'll not shut you down.
─ Hey, just a minute.

1150
01:07:45,878 --> 01:07:46,979
Thanks for the favor.

1151
01:07:48,235 --> 01:07:49,451
Here's your hundred back.

1152
01:07:49,993 --> 01:07:53,103
And the kind of a guy I am, I won't
make you pick it up off the floor.

1153
01:08:05,012 --> 01:08:07,415
Coming from his face to
yours, I'd say you won.

1154
01:08:07,565 --> 01:08:08,380
Hands down.

1155
01:08:09,165 --> 01:08:12,172
Do you think you'd better start hoping
that's all bunk about judgement day?

1156
01:08:12,441 --> 01:08:14,029
I feel generous. Buy yourself a drink.

1157
01:08:15,563 --> 01:08:17,835
I guess you didn't hear me.
It doesn't matter then.

1158
01:08:18,661 --> 01:08:20,377
Jeff, from here on we're in clover.

1159
01:08:22,926 --> 01:08:23,963
In high hats.

1160
01:08:24,203 --> 01:08:26,744
Crawling under the stomach
of our favorite snake.

1161
01:08:50,310 --> 01:08:52,267
What race is this?
─ The 6th.

1162
01:08:57,246 --> 01:09:00,340
Hey, hoist those plates and show prices.
That's what the dames go for.

1163
01:09:00,571 --> 01:09:01,564
Okay, Johnny.

1164
01:09:01,927 --> 01:09:03,999
Our take is fifty-three
grand up to this race.

1165
01:09:04,776 --> 01:09:06,221
Count me out fifty-three hundred.

1166
01:09:06,950 --> 01:09:09,060
We're taking twenty
percent on the breakage.

1167
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:10,614
What's that to crow about?

1168
01:09:10,714 --> 01:09:13,241
Think we've a racing commission?
Nothing like that in this state.

1169
01:09:13,341 --> 01:09:14,535
Make it twenty-five.

1170
01:09:15,511 --> 01:09:16,621
Smart, Johnny.

1171
01:09:17,489 --> 01:09:18,562
Fifty-three hundred.

1172
01:09:18,917 --> 01:09:19,589
Julio.

1173
01:09:20,587 --> 01:09:23,176
Take this down to Halligan. Tell him
it's what he won on the first five.

1174
01:09:23,980 --> 01:09:25,224
Tell him he's a lucky man.

1175
01:09:25,647 --> 01:09:26,462
Yeah, boss.

1176
01:09:35,199 --> 01:09:36,043
Mr Halligan.

1177
01:09:37,477 --> 01:09:38,183
Julio.

1178
01:09:39,176 --> 01:09:41,534
You know Councilman French
and Mr Ruffing here, don't you?

1179
01:09:42,089 --> 01:09:42,733
Sure.

1180
01:09:43,652 --> 01:09:45,682
Can I talk?
─ It's okay. What's on your mind?

1181
01:09:47,180 --> 01:09:49,651
The boss says here is what
you won in the first five races.

1182
01:09:50,788 --> 01:09:52,061
He says you're a lucky man.

1183
01:09:53,588 --> 01:09:54,947
Do you think I'm lucky, Julio?

1184
01:09:55,672 --> 01:09:56,544
I don't know.

1185
01:09:56,798 --> 01:09:58,433
You are either lucky or smart, huh?

1186
01:09:59,085 --> 01:10:00,101
Say, you're smart.

1187
01:10:00,464 --> 01:10:02,083
But you're not so lucky, huh Julio?

1188
01:10:02,470 --> 01:10:03,342
I don't know.

1189
01:10:03,923 --> 01:10:05,704
You're doing a lot of good work for ..

1190
01:10:06,388 --> 01:10:07,732
For this outfit, too.

1191
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:12,888
I wonder how they were able to open
a track under the nose of Mr Farrell.

1192
01:10:15,232 --> 01:10:18,957
Maybe if I'd be a little more smart, I'd
be a little more lucky, huh Mr Halligan?

1193
01:10:19,571 --> 01:10:20,501
I'm sure of it.

1194
01:10:22,230 --> 01:10:23,703
Well, I've had enough for tonight.

1195
01:10:24,223 --> 01:10:26,269
Let's go down to the joint.
Start a little game, huh?

1196
01:10:26,953 --> 01:10:28,312
You want to come along, Julio?

1197
01:10:29,552 --> 01:10:30,406
Sure.

1198
01:10:36,905 --> 01:10:38,207
If you'll excuse me, please.

1199
01:10:38,723 --> 01:10:41,061
Well, hello Mr Verne.
─ Why, hello Johnny.

1200
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:44,189
Quite a crowd, isn't it.
Quite an event, isn't it.

1201
01:10:44,377 --> 01:10:46,660
Yeah. I just dropped
in out of curiosity.

1202
01:10:46,760 --> 01:10:48,595
How you suppose they
got this past Mr Farrell?

1203
01:10:48,695 --> 01:10:50,540
Somebody must have
closed an eye, eh Mr Verne?

1204
01:10:50,802 --> 01:10:52,259
Oh, are you betting?
─ Well.

1205
01:10:52,904 --> 01:10:56,287
Just as long as it's here. Mrs Verne has
never seen anything like this, you know.

1206
01:10:56,846 --> 01:10:59,362
Well, I imagine they're already
drawing up a bill to cover it.

1207
01:10:59,539 --> 01:11:01,012
Oh sure. Well, good luck Mr Verne.

1208
01:11:01,469 --> 01:11:02,427
So long, Johnny.

1209
01:11:07,622 --> 01:11:08,373
Johnny.

1210
01:11:09,020 --> 01:11:09,757
Yeah?

1211
01:11:09,857 --> 01:11:11,847
There is a lady in there
who is asking about you.

1212
01:11:12,038 --> 01:11:13,296
Who?
─ Mae.

1213
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:15,687
May Blythe. Remember?

1214
01:11:17,951 --> 01:11:18,938
What do you know?

1215
01:11:24,467 --> 01:11:26,015
Hello, Mae.
─ Johnny.

1216
01:11:26,757 --> 01:11:28,399
I was just talking to Jeff.
─ Yeah.

1217
01:11:28,779 --> 01:11:30,627
I was hoping maybe I'd see you around.

1218
01:11:30,896 --> 01:11:33,222
I've just dropped in.
I'm pushing a hack now.

1219
01:11:33,513 --> 01:11:35,290
Jeff told me.
─ You're looking good, Mae.

1220
01:11:35,496 --> 01:11:36,210
Well.

1221
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:39,717
I'll take one straight my friend
as a loving cup to the past.

1222
01:11:39,924 --> 01:11:41,458
The chump is still at it.
─ Yes.

1223
01:11:42,049 --> 01:11:44,350
I was hoping maybe you
could do me a favor, Johnny.

1224
01:11:44,450 --> 01:11:46,009
It's been a long time, hasn't it may.

1225
01:11:46,509 --> 01:11:49,094
Hey, you remember that fresh guy that
got a yen for you down in Miami?

1226
01:11:49,630 --> 01:11:50,874
I had to let him have one.

1227
01:11:51,609 --> 01:11:54,086
You're the only dame I ever slugged
a guy over, Mae. You know that?

1228
01:11:54,186 --> 01:11:54,897
Sure.

1229
01:11:55,162 --> 01:11:56,921
You know I'm married
now, don't you Johnny.

1230
01:11:57,302 --> 01:12:00,265
Yeah, that's right. Say, you
married a Cop, didn't you?

1231
01:12:00,723 --> 01:12:02,623
You married a Cop.
─ And I got three kids.

1232
01:12:03,010 --> 01:12:05,586
I got three swell kids, Johnny.
─ Well, what do you know.

1233
01:12:05,838 --> 01:12:07,428
Well, we're in an awful fix.

1234
01:12:07,585 --> 01:12:09,620
Joe is straight, see.
He's as straight as a string.

1235
01:12:09,898 --> 01:12:13,341
He wouldn't stand for any finagling on
his beat, slot-machines and all that.

1236
01:12:14,200 --> 01:12:15,902
Well, it's right next
to the high-school.

1237
01:12:16,008 --> 01:12:18,522
And suddenly he's moved
off of it. Way out to Yarrows.

1238
01:12:18,818 --> 01:12:20,853
It takes him two hours to
get there in the morning.

1239
01:12:20,953 --> 01:12:23,014
And then two hours before
he gets home at night.

1240
01:12:23,345 --> 01:12:24,732
And Johnny ..
─ You know, Mae.

1241
01:12:24,891 --> 01:12:26,021
He isn't well, Johnny.

1242
01:12:26,274 --> 01:12:27,375
He isn't well at all.

1243
01:12:28,085 --> 01:12:30,879
And when he does get home at
night his feet hurt and he's dog tired.

1244
01:12:31,202 --> 01:12:32,504
He don't see the kids and ..

1245
01:12:33,493 --> 01:12:35,408
Well, this isn't his fault, see.

1246
01:12:35,783 --> 01:12:39,005
He's not to blame. But we're beginning
to fight and squawk at each other.

1247
01:12:39,571 --> 01:12:41,892
And he loves me, Johnny.
I know it.

1248
01:12:42,076 --> 01:12:43,463
What do you want me to do, Mae?

1249
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,120
Well, I just thought maybe
you'd still know somebody ..

1250
01:12:46,267 --> 01:12:49,326
Or someone who knew how to have it fixed
to get him put back to where he was.

1251
01:12:50,490 --> 01:12:53,578
Can't you do it for me?
Look, this is him.

1252
01:12:54,838 --> 01:12:57,268
Joe Advernöwksi. His number is 711.

1253
01:13:02,723 --> 01:13:04,311
Sorry, Mae. There is nothing I can do.

1254
01:13:05,235 --> 01:13:07,204
That one sure went down the wrong way.

1255
01:13:08,514 --> 01:13:11,033
I .. just thought you might
know somebody that ..

1256
01:13:11,675 --> 01:13:13,628
Would want to do you
a favor for old time's sake.

1257
01:13:14,144 --> 01:13:16,333
There is nothing lower than
an ex big-shot. You know that.

1258
01:13:16,484 --> 01:13:18,415
Everybody ducks you.
They're afraid of the touch.

1259
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:20,974
There's no such thing
as for-old-times-sake.

1260
01:13:21,952 --> 01:13:22,596
Well.

1261
01:13:23,717 --> 01:13:25,019
Thanks for listening anyway.

1262
01:13:27,761 --> 01:13:28,686
Oh, Johnny.

1263
01:13:29,002 --> 01:13:32,185
If you should ever meet Joe or anything
you won't tell him I saw you, will you.

1264
01:13:32,543 --> 01:13:34,288
I guess he don't ride in cabs much.

1265
01:13:34,539 --> 01:13:35,726
Say, wait a minute here.

1266
01:13:35,962 --> 01:13:37,992
You mean you told him about us?
─ Sure.

1267
01:13:38,210 --> 01:13:40,198
I think he'd black my
eye if he knew about this.

1268
01:13:40,688 --> 01:13:43,448
Sure I told him, Johnny.
I had to be honest with him.

1269
01:13:44,085 --> 01:13:45,244
You see I love the guy.

1270
01:13:46,219 --> 01:13:48,312
Love. Grade A pasteurized, eh?

1271
01:13:48,707 --> 01:13:49,608
I get it, kid.

1272
01:13:50,904 --> 01:13:51,950
No you don't.

1273
01:13:52,747 --> 01:13:53,934
You don't get it at all.

1274
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:57,089
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

1275
01:13:58,941 --> 01:14:00,157
So long, Johnny.

1276
01:14:00,698 --> 01:14:01,599
So long, Mae.

1277
01:14:07,938 --> 01:14:08,639
Johnny.

1278
01:14:09,394 --> 01:14:10,038
What?

1279
01:14:11,034 --> 01:14:12,882
How can you stand it?
─ What?

1280
01:14:13,380 --> 01:14:15,613
You reek with good deeds.

1281
01:14:16,343 --> 01:14:18,341
Ah .. let's go up and look at the tally.

1282
01:14:20,310 --> 01:14:21,874
But Mr Farrell sent me here.

1283
01:14:22,075 --> 01:14:24,006
Eager will know it's
alright. Just tell him that.

1284
01:14:24,751 --> 01:14:27,546
We don't know Eager, my friend.
─ Look, if you'll just tell him ..

1285
01:14:28,570 --> 01:14:29,528
Hello, Mr Eager.

1286
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:32,622
Hiya.
─ Can I see you for a moment?

1287
01:14:33,122 --> 01:14:34,302
It's a cinch. In here.

1288
01:14:43,730 --> 01:14:45,289
Wait in here. I'll be right with you.

1289
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:54,407
I'm sorry. My name is Courtney.

1290
01:14:54,724 --> 01:14:56,169
Don't be. My name is Hartnett.

1291
01:14:56,418 --> 01:14:57,891
Do you want a drink?
─ No thanks.

1292
01:15:01,083 --> 01:15:02,156
What's on your mind?

1293
01:15:03,870 --> 01:15:05,066
Where can we talk alone?

1294
01:15:05,599 --> 01:15:06,729
This is about Lisbeth.

1295
01:15:07,199 --> 01:15:10,179
Your problem is solved.
I've got to be spared this.

1296
01:15:10,365 --> 01:15:11,123
Sit down.

1297
01:15:11,394 --> 01:15:13,494
This is an uptown character.
He likes an audience.

1298
01:15:13,637 --> 01:15:15,416
Jonathan, in the name of all ..
─ Quiet.

1299
01:15:16,573 --> 01:15:18,373
I've got all night.
Now, what about Lisbeth?

1300
01:15:27,980 --> 01:15:30,061
Eager, you haven't seen
Lisbeth in five days now.

1301
01:15:31,374 --> 01:15:32,846
She's in frightful shape, Eager.

1302
01:15:34,148 --> 01:15:35,535
All that time she hasn't eaten.

1303
01:15:36,374 --> 01:15:39,229
I don't think she's said ten words.
I don't think she's even slept.

1304
01:15:40,398 --> 01:15:43,339
Just staying awake with some
awful sort of driving hysteria.

1305
01:15:44,186 --> 01:15:45,545
She won't let people near her.

1306
01:15:47,381 --> 01:15:49,579
There is nothing wrong with
her that doctors can cure.

1307
01:15:50,973 --> 01:15:52,217
They say it's in her mind.

1308
01:15:53,782 --> 01:15:54,843
I'll go deeper.

1309
01:15:55,587 --> 01:15:56,882
I'll say it's in her soul.

1310
01:15:57,418 --> 01:15:58,634
I don't follow you there.

1311
01:15:59,971 --> 01:16:01,072
Well her heart, then.

1312
01:16:01,671 --> 01:16:03,717
But whatever it is, it's
mixed up with you, isn't it.

1313
01:16:04,543 --> 01:16:05,616
I'm still listening.

1314
01:16:07,241 --> 01:16:09,964
Well, I don't know much
about you or your activities.

1315
01:16:10,887 --> 01:16:13,609
But it seems to me everything is
messed up because you have to stay here.

1316
01:16:14,471 --> 01:16:15,687
Here in this town I mean.

1317
01:16:16,740 --> 01:16:18,410
Not only because of your parole, but ..

1318
01:16:18,822 --> 01:16:20,896
Because of this track and
the money it will bring you.

1319
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:25,271
I thought perhaps if you had enough
money you could go someplace else.

1320
01:16:26,450 --> 01:16:27,208
I get it.

1321
01:16:28,329 --> 01:16:29,283
How much money?

1322
01:16:29,976 --> 01:16:31,363
Three hundred thousand dollars.

1323
01:16:32,474 --> 01:16:34,062
You're only half way to the boat, pal.

1324
01:16:34,425 --> 01:16:36,270
I got a half million
bucks tied up out there.

1325
01:16:36,397 --> 01:16:38,021
I got to get that back and more.

1326
01:16:39,689 --> 01:16:40,590
Alright, then.

1327
01:16:41,933 --> 01:16:42,863
I'll meet that.

1328
01:16:43,491 --> 01:16:45,250
I think I know where
I can borrow the rest.

1329
01:16:45,791 --> 01:16:48,339
And it'll be in your hand, Eager.
Cash. You won't have to wait for it.

1330
01:16:48,439 --> 01:16:49,901
Where did <i>you</i> get such credit?

1331
01:16:50,001 --> 01:16:52,733
What racket have you got to bring you
three hundred grand in the first place?

1332
01:16:53,316 --> 01:16:54,560
Well, hold on to your hat.

1333
01:16:55,111 --> 01:16:59,057
My maternal grandfather left it to me
for not taking a drink until I was 21.

1334
01:16:59,510 --> 01:17:00,599
Mr Courtney.

1335
01:17:00,839 --> 01:17:02,558
If you wish to make up for lost time.

1336
01:17:02,736 --> 01:17:05,697
I'll be honored to buy you
drinks from here to the grave.

1337
01:17:06,636 --> 01:17:08,745
I had forgotten about
characters like you.

1338
01:17:10,806 --> 01:17:11,678
How about it?

1339
01:17:12,413 --> 01:17:14,041
You're being a real sucker, aren't you.

1340
01:17:14,141 --> 01:17:15,908
You give me the dough
to jump out the way.

1341
01:17:16,008 --> 01:17:18,226
Because you think it will sit
Lisbeth right in your lap.

1342
01:17:18,326 --> 01:17:19,821
You guarantee that'll happen?

1343
01:17:19,921 --> 01:17:22,739
How do you know after you give me the
dough I won't take the girl off with me?

1344
01:17:24,208 --> 01:17:26,445
I'm sorry. I thought you understood.

1345
01:17:27,169 --> 01:17:28,928
I <i>mean</i> you to take her
with you. Naturally.

1346
01:17:30,947 --> 01:17:31,649
What?

1347
01:17:32,908 --> 01:17:34,210
Why do you want it that way?

1348
01:17:35,370 --> 01:17:36,700
There can't be any other way.

1349
01:17:37,428 --> 01:17:38,678
She's in love with you.

1350
01:17:41,326 --> 01:17:42,103
Well.

1351
01:17:42,659 --> 01:17:44,968
It will never be said you don't
make interesting propositions.

1352
01:17:46,237 --> 01:17:47,663
I'll think it over.
─ Alright.

1353
01:17:48,471 --> 01:17:50,316
Let me know just as soon
as you can, will you.

1354
01:17:50,701 --> 01:17:51,802
Thanks for seeing me.

1355
01:17:58,535 --> 01:18:00,570
What's his angle?
I don't see how he can win.

1356
01:18:01,031 --> 01:18:02,854
What's his angle?
That's what I want to know.

1357
01:18:02,954 --> 01:18:04,730
You've never met him before, Johnny.

1358
01:18:05,171 --> 01:18:07,559
He the best-dressed bible
salesman in the world.

1359
01:18:07,718 --> 01:18:10,250
Ah, cut the words will you, Jeff.
I want to figure it out. That's all.

1360
01:18:11,651 --> 01:18:13,654
What's his angle? What's his reason?

1361
01:18:14,129 --> 01:18:17,113
A guy has got to have a reason to
make a daffy proposition like that.

1362
01:18:17,266 --> 01:18:18,528
Oh forget it, Johnny.

1363
01:18:19,654 --> 01:18:21,491
Maybe I just can't think
like a sucker, huh?

1364
01:18:21,815 --> 01:18:23,218
You can't figure it out either?

1365
01:18:23,318 --> 01:18:26,779
Yes, I can figure his angle.
Lots of strange people could.

1366
01:18:27,972 --> 01:18:30,897
But nobody born to woman
could explain it to you, Johnny.

1367
01:18:31,710 --> 01:18:32,441
Why not?

1368
01:18:33,449 --> 01:18:34,840
Go on, give it to me. Why not?

1369
01:18:35,729 --> 01:18:37,370
Because it's unselfish.

1370
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:49,625
That broke it.

1371
01:19:16,493 --> 01:19:18,452
Here Gypsy, here.
─ He isn't bothering anybody.

1372
01:19:20,138 --> 01:19:21,646
Sure .. okay, boss.

1373
01:19:38,562 --> 01:19:39,291
So what?

1374
01:19:40,630 --> 01:19:43,616
Like poor Garnet,
I came back for my purse.

1375
01:19:44,763 --> 01:19:46,337
But this tableau is good enough.

1376
01:19:48,032 --> 01:19:51,192
If your hair were gray you'd
look like Whistler's mother.

1377
01:19:54,316 --> 01:19:55,703
I didn't mean to hit you, Jeff.

1378
01:19:56,764 --> 01:19:59,048
But you shouldn't needle me
like that. You shouldn't do it.

1379
01:19:59,558 --> 01:20:02,594
The needle shall be proportionately
dulled from now on.

1380
01:20:05,627 --> 01:20:07,372
A fine thing you walking out on me.

1381
01:20:07,514 --> 01:20:09,531
What would you do with yourself?
Where would you go?

1382
01:20:11,315 --> 01:20:12,908
Do you know where I was going, Johnny?

1383
01:20:14,411 --> 01:20:16,326
Right down to the District Attorney.

1384
01:20:18,537 --> 01:20:22,649
Yes I was, Johnny. I was going to turn
the key on you. I was going to sing.

1385
01:20:23,988 --> 01:20:26,820
Sing and yodel and blow a loud whistle.

1386
01:20:27,220 --> 01:20:29,768
I was going to sing the
whole beautiful opera.

1387
01:20:30,791 --> 01:20:31,463
About.

1388
01:20:32,814 --> 01:20:36,545
Poor old Lew Rankin and those
two impetuous Mullavey brothers.

1389
01:20:37,157 --> 01:20:39,366
May their souls rest in cement.

1390
01:20:40,697 --> 01:20:44,402
I was going to be the troubadour of
all the Eager folks on this, Johnny.

1391
01:20:48,273 --> 01:20:50,362
And then I was going
to blow my brains out.

1392
01:20:52,396 --> 01:20:55,669
You would .. you would do that to me
just for dusting you across the mouth?

1393
01:20:56,988 --> 01:20:57,652
No.

1394
01:20:59,432 --> 01:21:02,224
No. I just suddenly got
a stomach-full of myself.

1395
01:21:03,385 --> 01:21:06,176
After all, I was sitting listening
to you talk about that little girl ..

1396
01:21:06,276 --> 01:21:07,796
And not doing anything about it.

1397
01:21:09,413 --> 01:21:12,613
Somebody has got to, I said
to myself. And so it will be me.

1398
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:16,818
And the way to do it is to turn
the key on Johnny Eager.

1399
01:21:17,867 --> 01:21:19,376
Turn it and break it off.

1400
01:21:24,810 --> 01:21:26,283
But do you know something, Johnny?

1401
01:21:28,918 --> 01:21:30,012
You stopped me.

1402
01:21:31,623 --> 01:21:34,307
Right out there, you
paraded by the grandstand.

1403
01:21:35,125 --> 01:21:39,012
She'd only eat her heart out a little
slower with you in the death cell and ..

1404
01:21:40,109 --> 01:21:40,740
I ..

1405
01:21:41,731 --> 01:21:44,261
I haven't got the nerve
to blow my brains out.

1406
01:21:45,466 --> 01:21:48,664
Or the money to pay for one
of your assassins to do it for me.

1407
01:21:51,145 --> 01:21:55,082
No. It's just like you said,
Johnny. You're the boss.

1408
01:21:56,978 --> 01:21:59,072
You've got everybody over a barrel.

1409
01:21:59,677 --> 01:22:01,515
Ah, cut it out will you. Cut it out!

1410
01:22:03,975 --> 01:22:07,601
This slight seizure is over,
Jonathan. I assure you.

1411
01:22:08,791 --> 01:22:10,674
Why you daffy boob.

1412
01:22:10,855 --> 01:22:12,815
Give a fellah a chance to
say something, will you.

1413
01:22:13,337 --> 01:22:15,823
I'm going up to see Lisbeth.
I'll straighten her out in no time.

1414
01:22:15,987 --> 01:22:19,022
I'll show her those uptown
croakers. This is Dr Eager talking.

1415
01:22:20,169 --> 01:22:23,869
On the level, Johnny. You do feel
a little bit different there, don't you?

1416
01:22:25,855 --> 01:22:28,389
What are you talking about? She's
no different from any other dame.

1417
01:22:29,073 --> 01:22:31,821
A little better quality, I'll admit.
But just a kid after all.

1418
01:22:32,587 --> 01:22:35,252
Just .. a kid thinks
she's carrying a torch.

1419
01:22:36,131 --> 01:22:37,024
Come on.

1420
01:22:38,117 --> 01:22:41,861
Come on, I'll go there, throw her some
laughs. Snap her out of it in no time.

1421
01:22:43,387 --> 01:22:45,566
Come on, now. I'm doing this
for you as much as anybody.

1422
01:22:46,364 --> 01:22:48,152
Not going to walk out
on me again, are you?

1423
01:23:10,395 --> 01:23:11,741
Well, you go do your stuff.

1424
01:23:12,303 --> 01:23:13,519
You come in with me, huh?

1425
01:23:14,001 --> 01:23:15,782
No. I've seen enough for one night.

1426
01:23:18,801 --> 01:23:21,042
What are you waiting for?
Can't you think up any laughs?

1427
01:23:21,650 --> 01:23:24,356
Funny thing. Now that I'm here I don't
know exactly what to say to the kid.

1428
01:23:25,405 --> 01:23:28,352
Put your arms around her, Johnny.
Maybe that will give you an idea.

1429
01:23:28,840 --> 01:23:30,121
Ah, sober up will you.

1430
01:23:44,169 --> 01:23:45,985
Say, look. Tell Miss Bard
I want to see her.

1431
01:23:46,211 --> 01:23:48,156
And what is the name, sir?
─ Eager. Johnny Eager.

1432
01:23:49,585 --> 01:23:50,798
What do you want, Eager?

1433
01:23:57,384 --> 01:23:59,591
They tell me Lisbeth
is still kind of rocky.

1434
01:23:59,891 --> 01:24:01,794
I thought maybe I could
help snap her out of it.

1435
01:24:04,422 --> 01:24:06,283
Very well.
─ Is she in her room?

1436
01:24:07,176 --> 01:24:07,933
Yes.

1437
01:24:08,311 --> 01:24:10,110
Turn to the right at
the head of the stairs.

1438
01:24:10,210 --> 01:24:11,511
It's at the end of the hall.

1439
01:24:15,772 --> 01:24:18,764
Oh she knows I told you
all about this, doesn't she?

1440
01:24:19,263 --> 01:24:20,119
Yes.

1441
01:24:21,853 --> 01:24:24,516
I surely thought it would
ease her mind to know that ..

1442
01:24:25,340 --> 01:24:27,178
I understood and wanted to help her.

1443
01:24:28,557 --> 01:24:30,546
I even .. told her about our ..

1444
01:24:30,953 --> 01:24:32,706
Deal concerning the dog track.

1445
01:24:33,475 --> 01:24:34,708
What did she say to that?

1446
01:24:35,247 --> 01:24:36,491
She wouldn't say anything.

1447
01:24:38,225 --> 01:24:40,756
She just pretended she didn't
know what I was talking about.

1448
01:24:43,040 --> 01:24:45,589
Now, she thinks of me
only as a Policeman who ..

1449
01:24:46,153 --> 01:24:47,639
Wants to send you back to jail.

1450
01:24:48,810 --> 01:24:49,825
Well, aren't you?

1451
01:24:50,436 --> 01:24:51,789
That isn't the point, Eager.

1452
01:24:53,256 --> 01:24:54,976
My daughter always trusted me.

1453
01:24:57,988 --> 01:24:59,235
But she doesn't anymore.

1454
01:25:02,147 --> 01:25:03,277
You managed that, too.

1455
01:25:06,749 --> 01:25:08,594
You don't have to break
down and cry about it.

1456
01:25:09,778 --> 01:25:11,201
You will not have that pleasure.

1457
01:25:26,285 --> 01:25:28,139
Yes?
─ Is Miss Bard ..?

1458
01:25:29,959 --> 01:25:31,709
Johnny.
─ Hello, kid.

1459
01:25:34,148 --> 01:25:36,091
Never mind, Ella. You can go please.

1460
01:25:36,418 --> 01:25:37,233
Yes, ma'am.

1461
01:25:39,795 --> 01:25:40,559
Johnny!

1462
01:25:42,923 --> 01:25:44,370
Johnny, you shouldn't have come.

1463
01:25:45,182 --> 01:25:46,708
There might be someone they want ..

1464
01:25:46,808 --> 01:25:50,065
It's all okay, kid. I just saw your
father. He sent me up here.

1465
01:25:52,288 --> 01:25:53,866
I knew you'd come when you could.

1466
01:25:55,082 --> 01:25:56,113
Oh, Johnny.

1467
01:25:57,194 --> 01:25:58,321
It's been so awful.

1468
01:25:59,019 --> 01:25:59,959
It's all wrong.

1469
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:03,538
I hope it's alright
now that you're here.

1470
01:26:03,816 --> 01:26:06,487
Listen darling, nothing is
awful. Everything is okay.

1471
01:26:06,672 --> 01:26:09,765
We're both covered in this. It's happy
days. You've got to snap out of it.

1472
01:26:09,865 --> 01:26:10,633
Shush.

1473
01:26:11,499 --> 01:26:12,171
Lower.

1474
01:26:13,431 --> 01:26:14,901
Don't. They might be listening.

1475
01:26:15,954 --> 01:26:17,323
It might be just a trick.

1476
01:26:18,046 --> 01:26:19,103
Let's go out here.

1477
01:26:26,127 --> 01:26:27,394
Hold me tight.

1478
01:26:28,182 --> 01:26:29,587
Hey, you're cold.

1479
01:26:30,976 --> 01:26:31,848
Just hold me.

1480
01:26:32,185 --> 01:26:34,704
Now look Lisbeth.
I don't like this. You look bad.

1481
01:26:35,456 --> 01:26:36,339
I'm alright.

1482
01:26:36,771 --> 01:26:38,588
It's just that I haven't
slept much, I guess.

1483
01:26:39,491 --> 01:26:42,522
I've been afraid to. You see I might
talk and they might be listening.

1484
01:26:42,622 --> 01:26:44,842
Get this in your head. We're fixed.
There's nothing to ..

1485
01:26:44,942 --> 01:26:45,848
Johnny, wait.

1486
01:26:46,613 --> 01:26:48,144
There is one thing I've got to know.

1487
01:26:50,499 --> 01:26:52,802
Did that man .. did he have any family?

1488
01:26:53,041 --> 01:26:55,291
What do you mean?
─ A wife and children.

1489
01:26:55,485 --> 01:26:57,567
No, no .. not a soul.

1490
01:26:59,242 --> 01:27:00,515
Oh thank goodness for that.

1491
01:27:01,758 --> 01:27:03,165
It's been on my mind so.

1492
01:27:03,473 --> 01:27:05,410
It wasn't their fault he was that way.

1493
01:27:06,645 --> 01:27:08,530
I was afraid they might
need things and I ..

1494
01:27:08,833 --> 01:27:11,646
Wanted to tell you to find a way that I
could send them what they might need.

1495
01:27:11,746 --> 01:27:13,835
Now look, Lisbeth. You've
got to be tough about this.

1496
01:27:13,935 --> 01:27:15,951
Just as tough as he'd of been if ..
─ Darling, I am.

1497
01:27:17,317 --> 01:27:18,113
I will be.

1498
01:27:19,916 --> 01:27:21,922
Your parole has less than
a year to run, hasn't it?

1499
01:27:22,201 --> 01:27:23,268
Yeah, that's right.

1500
01:27:23,368 --> 01:27:25,814
And after that, they couldn't take
you back just for being present?

1501
01:27:26,851 --> 01:27:28,725
They couldn't do a thing
like that, could they?

1502
01:27:29,677 --> 01:27:32,063
I mean it won't get you into
any more trouble unless you ..

1503
01:27:32,316 --> 01:27:33,706
You actually committed a crime.

1504
01:27:34,817 --> 01:27:36,290
Did something yourself after that.

1505
01:27:37,005 --> 01:27:37,820
Could they?

1506
01:27:38,041 --> 01:27:41,169
Sure, that's it. But look, that is ..
─ I can hold out that long.

1507
01:27:43,290 --> 01:27:44,573
A year isn't so much.

1508
01:27:47,580 --> 01:27:50,374
If you'll just keep holding me
like this every now and then.

1509
01:27:51,007 --> 01:27:52,315
What are you getting at?

1510
01:27:52,592 --> 01:27:54,585
They'll never get a word
out of me until then.

1511
01:27:56,444 --> 01:27:59,371
You know Johnny, it would
be such a relief to tell.

1512
01:28:01,604 --> 01:28:02,734
You'll tell who, what?

1513
01:28:04,157 --> 01:28:05,654
The Police and everything.

1514
01:28:07,419 --> 01:28:09,434
Just as soon as it won't
get you into any trouble.

1515
01:28:11,064 --> 01:28:11,933
I must.

1516
01:28:13,371 --> 01:28:15,565
You just can't live with a
thing like that in your heart.

1517
01:28:17,486 --> 01:28:19,906
Oh Johnny, it's only the thought
of them taking you back.

1518
01:28:20,062 --> 01:28:22,608
That's giving me the strength to
hold out that long. Don't you see?

1519
01:28:27,937 --> 01:28:30,617
You're getting holy.
─ It's alright, darling. I won't ..

1520
01:28:31,195 --> 01:28:32,354
Just be quiet a minute.

1521
01:28:33,046 --> 01:28:35,034
Just don't say anything
until I tell you something.

1522
01:28:36,369 --> 01:28:37,681
I'm telling you I love you.

1523
01:28:38,215 --> 01:28:39,201
Do you hear that?

1524
01:28:40,137 --> 01:28:41,507
I've known that all the time.

1525
01:28:42,315 --> 01:28:44,292
Is it true?
─ Yes.

1526
01:28:45,591 --> 01:28:46,521
Of course, kid.

1527
01:28:47,044 --> 01:28:48,763
You'll keep telling me
though, won't you.

1528
01:28:49,395 --> 01:28:50,131
Yeah.

1529
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:51,929
And look, I've ..

1530
01:28:52,619 --> 01:28:54,121
I've told that to other women, see.

1531
01:28:54,576 --> 01:28:56,037
But I never meant it before.

1532
01:28:57,121 --> 01:28:58,438
I never meant it until now.

1533
01:28:59,959 --> 01:29:02,534
Only to you .. I'll mean it always.

1534
01:29:03,300 --> 01:29:04,226
I know that.

1535
01:29:08,161 --> 01:29:09,943
For the first time I meant it.

1536
01:29:12,210 --> 01:29:12,864
Well.

1537
01:29:13,960 --> 01:29:15,061
Get yourself all set.

1538
01:29:15,464 --> 01:29:16,851
Get all set to start hating me.

1539
01:29:17,376 --> 01:29:19,280
Hating you?
─ Yeah. I used you, you understand.

1540
01:29:19,380 --> 01:29:22,549
You never killed anybody. That guy works
for me. The gun was full of blanks.

1541
01:29:22,674 --> 01:29:24,948
And I framed the whole deal so
you'd think you were in a jam.

1542
01:29:25,249 --> 01:29:27,924
That wasn't blood on his shirt. It was
ketchup. Ketchup out of the kitchen.

1543
01:29:28,401 --> 01:29:30,334
I used the thing as an
angle with your old man.

1544
01:29:30,434 --> 01:29:32,810
He still thinks it's on the level.
That's why my dog track runs.

1545
01:29:32,910 --> 01:29:34,775
He don't jump about it
as I got him on a hook.

1546
01:29:34,875 --> 01:29:36,707
He's afraid I'll spill
the beans about you.

1547
01:29:37,532 --> 01:29:40,070
Well do you understand? I framed you.
You've nothing to worry about.

1548
01:29:40,170 --> 01:29:42,912
That guy is walking around like you
and me. He's no more dead than we are.

1549
01:29:49,200 --> 01:29:50,281
Oh, Johnny.

1550
01:29:51,657 --> 01:29:52,846
Johnny, my darling.

1551
01:29:55,932 --> 01:29:57,392
To think up such a lie.

1552
01:29:58,270 --> 01:30:00,326
Such a wonderful, fantastic lie.

1553
01:30:01,599 --> 01:30:03,919
But that's the straight truth.
─ That's a beautiful lie.

1554
01:30:04,508 --> 01:30:06,329
To make his best girl feel best.

1555
01:30:06,479 --> 01:30:08,797
Lisbeth, you've got to believe me.
─ Oh, Johnny.

1556
01:30:10,233 --> 01:30:11,348
It's sweet.

1557
01:30:13,210 --> 01:30:14,190
Suddenly ..

1558
01:30:15,189 --> 01:30:16,353
I'm so tired.

1559
01:30:18,142 --> 01:30:19,328
I want to lie down.

1560
01:30:35,104 --> 01:30:37,867
You've got to understand you can walk
out of here and forget the whole thing.

1561
01:30:37,967 --> 01:30:39,583
And you never killed anybody.
─ Shush.

1562
01:30:41,131 --> 01:30:42,456
Hold my hand, Johnny.

1563
01:30:43,905 --> 01:30:45,850
But don't you see how
it was just a gag, kid?

1564
01:30:45,950 --> 01:30:46,824
I know.

1565
01:30:48,136 --> 01:30:49,896
I know .. a gag.

1566
01:30:53,570 --> 01:30:54,680
He looked so mad.

1567
01:30:55,972 --> 01:30:58,011
He tried to make himself convincing.

1568
01:30:59,362 --> 01:31:00,954
Kid, listen!
─ What?

1569
01:31:02,927 --> 01:31:04,156
I want to go to sleep.

1570
01:31:06,048 --> 01:31:07,748
I'm too tired for more jokes.

1571
01:31:09,566 --> 01:31:12,421
Just hold my hand .. and come back soon.

1572
01:31:13,889 --> 01:31:15,609
I don't feel like talking now.

1573
01:31:17,853 --> 01:31:19,832
I'll sleep so quietly, Johnny.

1574
01:31:21,614 --> 01:31:22,726
I won't talk.

1575
01:31:24,877 --> 01:31:26,002
You know I won't.

1576
01:31:36,138 --> 01:31:39,327
Sometimes when people have a new
experience they like to talk about it.

1577
01:31:40,843 --> 01:31:44,031
Well, she's got Julio in her head, and
it's driving her right out of her mind.

1578
01:31:46,479 --> 01:31:48,934
It's not very pretty, is it.
─ I've told her everything.

1579
01:31:49,256 --> 01:31:51,039
I tried to convince her
he was up and walking.

1580
01:31:51,139 --> 01:31:52,874
You told her?
─ She wouldn't believe me.

1581
01:31:53,356 --> 01:31:54,743
I couldn't make her believe it.

1582
01:31:55,053 --> 01:31:57,847
She just thinks I'm trying to feed her
a little soap. Can you imagine that?

1583
01:31:58,683 --> 01:31:59,801
Yes, I can.

1584
01:32:01,589 --> 01:32:02,461
So, what now?

1585
01:32:02,900 --> 01:32:05,555
It's a cinch. We just go and dig up
Julio and bring him here. That's all.

1586
01:32:05,655 --> 01:32:06,742
Go show him to her.

1587
01:32:06,842 --> 01:32:08,780
Johnny, you're taking a
pretty long chance there.

1588
01:32:08,938 --> 01:32:10,823
Why? It's a way to
set her right, isn't it?

1589
01:32:11,100 --> 01:32:13,431
Yes, sure. But what about you?

1590
01:32:14,082 --> 01:32:15,898
You know how I feel
for that girl, Johnny.

1591
01:32:15,998 --> 01:32:18,372
But I'm sitting beside you
now, like I'll always be.

1592
01:32:19,056 --> 01:32:22,219
How is she going to take it? She is
a female and a pretty good friend.

1593
01:32:22,713 --> 01:32:25,763
Why Johnny, you can't play that
kind of a woman for a sucker.

1594
01:32:25,863 --> 01:32:27,484
And then tell her about it so easy.

1595
01:32:27,584 --> 01:32:29,985
Didn't you hear me? I said she
can't take it the way it is now.

1596
01:32:30,126 --> 01:32:31,285
It's driving her crazy.

1597
01:32:32,132 --> 01:32:33,934
Supposing she spills it to Farrell?

1598
01:32:34,680 --> 01:32:37,469
You know, when a woman loves like that,
she can love with every card in a deck.

1599
01:32:37,635 --> 01:32:39,842
And then pull a knife across
your throat the next morning.

1600
01:32:40,152 --> 01:32:41,782
Don't you know that, Johnny? Don't you?

1601
01:32:41,882 --> 01:32:44,495
I don't know what I know. All I know
is what she's willing to do for me.

1602
01:32:44,595 --> 01:32:46,581
So alright, I've turned sucker.
So what about it?

1603
01:32:46,681 --> 01:32:48,640
What about it? Have you
got any other name for it?

1604
01:32:49,174 --> 01:32:49,895
Sure.

1605
01:32:50,874 --> 01:32:52,487
That's what makes the world go round.

1606
01:32:57,390 --> 01:32:59,752
Gee Johnny, where you been?
I've been calling all over.

1607
01:32:59,970 --> 01:33:02,122
Do you know the name of the
hotel where Julio stays?

1608
01:33:02,222 --> 01:33:04,092
Wait. You can't get hold
of Julio anymore.

1609
01:33:04,328 --> 01:33:05,744
He's going to work for Halligan.

1610
01:33:06,275 --> 01:33:07,960
Where did you get that?
─ From Halligan.

1611
01:33:08,137 --> 01:33:10,497
He called here a while back and
wants to see you in the morning.

1612
01:33:10,825 --> 01:33:12,920
He says from now on,
his end is fifty percent.

1613
01:33:13,344 --> 01:33:14,617
And to tell you he said so.

1614
01:33:14,928 --> 01:33:17,876
And he said something about
how a good actor like Julio ..

1615
01:33:18,319 --> 01:33:19,606
Ought to get better parts.

1616
01:33:20,485 --> 01:33:23,046
What did he mean, Johnny? He sounded
like he was talking safe and easy.

1617
01:33:23,295 --> 01:33:24,311
Are we in trouble?

1618
01:33:24,843 --> 01:33:27,159
No, you're never in trouble.
That's why you work for me.

1619
01:33:27,927 --> 01:33:29,341
See what I mean about a sucker?

1620
01:33:29,441 --> 01:33:31,715
There comes a time when he
doesn't keep his eyes on the ball.

1621
01:33:31,987 --> 01:33:34,821
That's an 8-ball, Johnny.
That's alright. I'm glad.

1622
01:33:35,482 --> 01:33:37,032
You'd better start drinking again.

1623
01:33:37,924 --> 01:33:39,483
But wait until we get this done, see.

1624
01:33:40,178 --> 01:33:43,204
What? What are you going to do?
─ I'll go and get Julio back again.

1625
01:33:43,371 --> 01:33:46,485
Look, Johnny. If you're going to fool
around with that guy the way he is now.

1626
01:33:46,865 --> 01:33:48,825
Don't you think you ought
to carry the difference?

1627
01:33:48,950 --> 01:33:51,058
Now I wonder why you
<i>don't </i>get into trouble.

1628
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:15,368
Looking for somebody, Jack?
─ Yeah.

1629
01:34:23,883 --> 01:34:24,527
Hiya.

1630
01:34:25,069 --> 01:34:25,913
Bill around?

1631
01:34:26,617 --> 01:34:28,750
No. He went down
the street to a meeting.

1632
01:34:29,655 --> 01:34:32,929
So you got a better job and quit on me
without even giving me a chance to bid.

1633
01:34:33,461 --> 01:34:36,165
Well, I can't blame a guy for bettering
himself, but you might have told me.

1634
01:34:37,599 --> 01:34:39,986
He's okay, a friend of mine.
─ Well, I didn't know.

1635
01:34:40,215 --> 01:34:41,946
He busted in here like
he owned the joint.

1636
01:34:45,385 --> 01:34:47,531
You know, Eager. I was a little worried.
─ Worried?

1637
01:34:48,114 --> 01:34:51,479
Yeah. That you might be sore at me for
quitting you and going to work for Bill.

1638
01:34:51,691 --> 01:34:54,597
What kind of a guy you think I am? All
the spots we've been through together?

1639
01:34:54,697 --> 01:34:56,742
You think I'd be sore that
you do yourself some good?

1640
01:34:57,787 --> 01:35:00,310
Remember the time those Vitallio
brothers threw all that stuff at us?

1641
01:35:01,595 --> 01:35:03,590
And blam, blam, blam.

1642
01:35:03,690 --> 01:35:05,548
Sounded like the Battle
Of The Marne alright.

1643
01:35:05,648 --> 01:35:06,501
Yeah, right.

1644
01:35:06,601 --> 01:35:08,141
When do you think Bill will be back?

1645
01:35:08,646 --> 01:35:10,039
Oh, about a half hour.

1646
01:35:10,974 --> 01:35:14,389
Hey .. remember the little
trouble we had at the 101 club?

1647
01:35:14,616 --> 01:35:15,899
Do I remember?

1648
01:35:16,411 --> 01:35:18,517
Why, you were a one-man army that night.

1649
01:35:20,010 --> 01:35:20,997
A half-hour, huh?

1650
01:35:21,720 --> 01:35:24,559
Hey, grab a coat. I got time to get an
errand done and get back to meet Bill.

1651
01:35:25,283 --> 01:35:26,041
Go where?

1652
01:35:26,143 --> 01:35:29,038
I've got to stop a guy from talking. I'm
going to do it with the toe of my shoe.

1653
01:35:29,382 --> 01:35:31,778
He may have friends objecting to
someone kicking his teeth out.

1654
01:35:31,878 --> 01:35:33,998
So I need a man with me.
─ Yeah, but Bill ..

1655
01:35:34,224 --> 01:35:36,336
Ah come on. We'll both
be back before he is.

1656
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:39,096
It's the last job you do for me.

1657
01:35:39,357 --> 01:35:40,594
There's five yards in it.

1658
01:35:40,694 --> 01:35:42,972
Ah, I ought to do it
free for old-time’s sake.

1659
01:35:44,249 --> 01:35:45,813
But I could use five hundred.

1660
01:35:48,118 --> 01:35:49,833
Hello, Bill.
─ Where you going?

1661
01:35:50,146 --> 01:35:51,485
With Eager, to see a man.

1662
01:35:52,109 --> 01:35:54,565
Yeah, I got a little deal I need
Julio for. You don't mind, Bill.

1663
01:35:55,427 --> 01:35:56,383
You drunk chump.

1664
01:35:56,483 --> 01:35:59,076
Don't you know you won't live 5
minutes if he gets you in a dark alley?

1665
01:35:59,176 --> 01:36:00,412
You're out of line, Bill.

1666
01:36:00,667 --> 01:36:03,399
Haven't you got sense enough to know
that if he kills you, he's in the clear?

1667
01:36:03,934 --> 01:36:05,321
Everything is right in his lap.

1668
01:36:05,826 --> 01:36:06,924
Julio, you're drunk.

1669
01:36:07,186 --> 01:36:10,502
He's just conning you into taking the
same kind of a ride that Lew Rankin got.

1670
01:36:11,190 --> 01:36:12,943
You're no making a
friend out of me, Bill.

1671
01:36:13,903 --> 01:36:15,168
I am drunk but ..

1672
01:36:16,659 --> 01:36:17,778
Eager wouldn't ..

1673
01:36:25,692 --> 01:36:27,198
I wouldn't touch that rod, Jack.

1674
01:36:28,399 --> 01:36:31,793
You can't win in this ballpark, chum.
It ain't your home ground.

1675
01:36:32,362 --> 01:36:35,194
You wouldn't pretend to point one of
those things at me, would you chum?

1676
01:36:35,477 --> 01:36:37,439
Just so you'll know I ain't pretending.

1677
01:36:39,675 --> 01:36:40,835
Catch on, chum?

1678
01:36:42,590 --> 01:36:44,569
I catch on, chum.
─ Smart fellow.

1679
01:36:44,948 --> 01:36:46,026
Just stand easy now.

1680
01:36:48,931 --> 01:36:50,490
He's clean, Bill. Nothing on him.

1681
01:36:50,971 --> 01:36:52,130
Johnny, this is awful.

1682
01:36:52,765 --> 01:36:54,668
You are saying it is awful,
so I guess it is so.

1683
01:36:54,950 --> 01:36:56,772
I've been cutting up
with you for ten years.

1684
01:36:56,872 --> 01:36:59,177
Now you try to talk that drunken
torpedo into knocking me off.

1685
01:36:59,277 --> 01:37:01,053
Nah, don't make any quick moves, chum.

1686
01:37:01,153 --> 01:37:02,891
Don't worry. You're
holding the top hand.

1687
01:37:03,148 --> 01:37:04,249
Johnny, listen to me.

1688
01:37:04,500 --> 01:37:06,883
There's been a lot of hot-headed
talk, but let's be sensible.

1689
01:37:07,338 --> 01:37:09,343
Let's not go to battling
between ourselves.

1690
01:37:09,505 --> 01:37:12,245
And spoil everything just when the
money is coming in all our windows.

1691
01:37:13,240 --> 01:37:15,388
How about it, Johnny?
You want to talk sense?

1692
01:37:15,853 --> 01:37:17,401
Make a new deal on the dog track?

1693
01:37:18,741 --> 01:37:20,338
Okay. Back to the original deal.

1694
01:37:21,296 --> 01:37:22,340
Now you're talking.

1695
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:24,873
Yeah. Mind if we iron out
the details in the morning?

1696
01:37:24,973 --> 01:37:26,617
I've got another little deal on tonight.

1697
01:37:27,697 --> 01:37:29,824
I guess I'll have to handle
it without our friend here.

1698
01:37:30,178 --> 01:37:32,081
I'll meet you here in the morning then?
─ Right.

1699
01:37:32,499 --> 01:37:33,429
Oh, and Johnny.

1700
01:37:35,266 --> 01:37:36,453
We're all friends again.

1701
01:37:36,948 --> 01:37:38,233
This beef is all forgotten?

1702
01:37:39,886 --> 01:37:41,166
All forgotten, Bill.

1703
01:37:41,666 --> 01:37:42,548
So long.

1704
01:37:53,777 --> 01:37:55,393
I'd say you didn't get what you wanted.

1705
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:56,469
Not yet.

1706
01:37:56,933 --> 01:37:58,435
So it's going to be like that, huh?

1707
01:37:58,559 --> 01:38:00,748
As long as I'm a sucker,
I might as well go the whole way.

1708
01:38:01,074 --> 01:38:03,561
You sit here and keep your eyes
glued on that door. Watch for Julio.

1709
01:38:03,661 --> 01:38:04,908
I'll be back in a minute.

1710
01:38:18,972 --> 01:38:21,479
Yes .. I'm leaving right now, dear.

1711
01:38:22,069 --> 01:38:23,574
Yes, yes. Right away.

1712
01:38:24,419 --> 01:38:26,916
Oh, good evening. I was
just going to close up.

1713
01:38:27,106 --> 01:38:28,522
I want to get a coat. A big one.

1714
01:38:28,653 --> 01:38:31,061
Oh, a large coat .. now let's see.

1715
01:38:31,454 --> 01:38:33,055
Here. Let's try this.

1716
01:38:35,997 --> 01:38:37,146
It's a real nice coat.

1717
01:38:38,592 --> 01:38:40,716
Is it for you?
─ For my brother.

1718
01:38:41,276 --> 01:38:43,521
Fits okay. How much?
─ Ten dollars.

1719
01:38:44,596 --> 01:38:45,812
You've got a big brother.

1720
01:38:46,249 --> 01:38:48,555
Give me the hat, too.
─ That's fifty cents.

1721
01:38:48,846 --> 01:38:50,532
And the scarf?
─ Fifty cents.

1722
01:38:51,157 --> 01:38:53,349
Take it back and brush it up.
Don't hurry. Make it clean.

1723
01:38:53,449 --> 01:38:54,854
Oh sure, sure. Thanks.

1724
01:38:55,348 --> 01:38:56,335
Thanks very much.

1725
01:39:06,637 --> 01:39:07,725
Hello?
"<i>Courtney?</i>"

1726
01:39:07,825 --> 01:39:08,936
This is Mr Courtney.

1727
01:39:09,036 --> 01:39:10,723
"<i>Listen, Courtney.
This is Johnny Eager</i>."

1728
01:39:10,823 --> 01:39:11,896
Oh. Yes, Eager?

1729
01:39:11,996 --> 01:39:13,629
"<i>Listen, sucker. Don't miss anything</i>."

1730
01:39:13,729 --> 01:39:15,774
"<i>And don't do anything
different to what I tell you</i>."

1731
01:39:16,577 --> 01:39:18,590
Well, here you are, mister.
─ Thank you.

1732
01:39:18,793 --> 01:39:20,932
Say, it just goes to
show you what luck is.

1733
01:39:21,435 --> 01:39:24,886
Twenty minutes ago I was going to
close up and I got to reading the paper.

1734
01:39:25,170 --> 01:39:29,822
For no reason I'm reading and I'm 20
minutes late and make an 11 dollar sale.

1735
01:39:31,370 --> 01:39:34,913
It just goes to show you a man can't
tell what's going to happen next.

1736
01:39:35,702 --> 01:39:37,016
Goodnight.
─ Goodnight.

1737
01:39:42,358 --> 01:39:44,203
Slide around from the
wheel. We're separating.

1738
01:39:44,508 --> 01:39:45,798
Look. You go get Billiken.

1739
01:39:45,898 --> 01:39:48,152
Have him take my cab and drive
you round to a dozen saloons.

1740
01:39:48,252 --> 01:39:49,432
You're a stooge, see.

1741
01:39:49,532 --> 01:39:52,309
You're shooting off your mouth about how
big-shot Johnny Eager's a cab driver.

1742
01:39:52,409 --> 01:39:54,122
But now I'm driving <i>you</i> around. Get it?

1743
01:39:54,222 --> 01:39:55,323
An alibi. Yeah, sure.

1744
01:39:55,791 --> 01:39:59,202
Well, how long should I keep up
this uncongenial bar-hopping?

1745
01:39:59,483 --> 01:40:00,857
Oh, until about daylight.

1746
01:40:01,277 --> 01:40:02,951
Then come back to the apartment.
─ Okay.

1747
01:40:03,921 --> 01:40:05,895
Get going.
─ Sure. So long, Johnny.

1748
01:40:06,356 --> 01:40:07,330
Hey, Johnny!

1749
01:40:08,743 --> 01:40:09,444
Johnny.

1750
01:40:10,477 --> 01:40:11,833
Yeah?
─ Ah ..

1751
01:40:12,498 --> 01:40:14,592
Listen, you know when
you batted me tonight?

1752
01:40:14,762 --> 01:40:16,984
Oh, that's water under the bridge.
─ Well, sure, but I ..

1753
01:40:17,165 --> 01:40:19,807
I had that coming. I just wondered
why didn't do it a long time ago.

1754
01:40:19,990 --> 01:40:21,826
Will you get going.
─ Johnny.

1755
01:40:22,430 --> 01:40:23,074
Ah ..

1756
01:40:23,812 --> 01:40:25,449
Have you ever been out to the Rockies?

1757
01:40:25,549 --> 01:40:27,462
Are you nuts? No. Never
been out to the Rockies.

1758
01:40:27,562 --> 01:40:30,601
Well, they've got big mountains
out there like Christmas trees.

1759
01:40:30,782 --> 01:40:34,381
The lakes as clear and as deep as
you ever saw in your mother's eyes.

1760
01:40:34,630 --> 01:40:35,636
Johnny ..

1761
01:40:36,289 --> 01:40:38,969
Johnny, let's go out there and
climb a couple of mountains.

1762
01:40:39,356 --> 01:40:40,615
Will you get going!

1763
01:40:41,804 --> 01:40:42,762
So long, Johnny.

1764
01:41:12,303 --> 01:41:13,919
There is no time. Turn off your lights.

1765
01:41:14,105 --> 01:41:16,190
Johnny, what is all this?
Why are you dressed ..?

1766
01:41:16,290 --> 01:41:18,151
Well, I'm cold. Maybe
I'm nervous, eh kid?

1767
01:41:18,382 --> 01:41:19,865
Johnny, tell me.
─ Listen to me.

1768
01:41:19,965 --> 01:41:23,199
Any minute now, one or two or three guys
are going to come out of the door there.

1769
01:41:23,299 --> 01:41:25,359
One of 'em will be the guy
you think you knocked off.

1770
01:41:25,459 --> 01:41:28,305
I'll bring him here and show him to you.
On his feet and full of life, as I said.

1771
01:41:28,553 --> 01:41:30,904
Johnny, I see through any masquerade.
─ You just wait.

1772
01:41:31,987 --> 01:41:34,376
What do you think your friend
here did? Had himself a big moment.

1773
01:41:34,683 --> 01:41:36,555
Saw I needed cash, so
offered me all his dough.

1774
01:41:36,655 --> 01:41:38,266
If I leave town and take you with me.

1775
01:41:38,366 --> 01:41:40,697
Now wait a minute, Eager. That
was a matter between you and me.

1776
01:41:41,159 --> 01:41:42,947
A funny way to be stuck
on a dame, isn't it?

1777
01:41:43,209 --> 01:41:46,557
I guess when you and I split up, you can
be half way happy with a guy like that.

1778
01:41:47,960 --> 01:41:48,957
Split up, Johnny?

1779
01:41:49,057 --> 01:41:52,091
Well, you know. People like you and
me, we break as quick as we hit.

1780
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:53,552
Johnny, don't joke any more.

1781
01:41:54,019 --> 01:41:55,810
You can't pretend now.
You said it tonight.

1782
01:41:56,077 --> 01:41:58,504
Ah sure, that. Well,
you're in a wingding.

1783
01:41:58,694 --> 01:42:01,330
You've got to say a few phony words
if it helps a pal out of a wingding.

1784
01:42:03,150 --> 01:42:04,915
I'll be alright .. so long.

1785
01:42:05,780 --> 01:42:07,683
Johnny, you don't ..
─ Cut it.          ─ But ..

1786
01:42:22,332 --> 01:42:23,405
Take it easy, Julio.

1787
01:42:24,676 --> 01:42:26,134
Just keep going the same way.

1788
01:42:33,551 --> 01:42:35,253
Well, here he is kid.
Take a look at him.

1789
01:42:35,496 --> 01:42:36,532
Alive and kicking.

1790
01:42:36,991 --> 01:42:39,118
Ugly rat isn't he? Too bad
you <i>didn't </i>bump him off.

1791
01:42:39,978 --> 01:42:41,537
Well, you see him, don't you?
─ Yes.

1792
01:42:42,111 --> 01:42:44,589
Yes but Johnny, what you said
a minute ago. You don't mean ..

1793
01:42:44,867 --> 01:42:47,604
You can get some sleep now, huh. You
don't have to be quiet any longer, see.

1794
01:42:47,860 --> 01:42:50,296
Johnny, look at me. You still don't
mean what you said, do you?

1795
01:42:50,691 --> 01:42:52,181
Sure. Sure I do.

1796
01:42:52,503 --> 01:42:55,064
That big pitch on your porch tonight
was a gag. Just like this guy was.

1797
01:42:55,189 --> 01:42:57,412
For a reason .. now get back in there.
─ No, Johnny.

1798
01:42:57,622 --> 01:42:59,181
Listen, kid. Get some sense will you.

1799
01:42:59,442 --> 01:43:02,146
If it's going to be like this between
you and me, we might as well forget ..

1800
01:43:04,274 --> 01:43:05,810
No, Johnny! Don't do that!

1801
01:43:08,914 --> 01:43:11,331
This street will cut loose any
minute. You got to get out of here.

1802
01:43:11,431 --> 01:43:13,756
Come on, Liz.
─ No, I won't go. Not until ..

1803
01:43:13,856 --> 01:43:14,937
Get the car started.

1804
01:43:15,037 --> 01:43:17,534
You got to go! Beat it now?
─ No, Johnny. I'm staying here with you.

1805
01:43:17,634 --> 01:43:18,998
As I know you're lying to me.

1806
01:43:19,098 --> 01:43:20,915
This time I want to know .. look at me!

1807
01:43:24,942 --> 01:43:26,208
Well, what if I am?

1808
01:43:35,688 --> 01:43:37,207
She'll remember I socked her.

1809
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:39,577
But don't you ever tell
her this. Understand?

1810
01:43:39,860 --> 01:43:42,323
Come with us, Eager.
─ I've got something to finish. Beat it.

1811
01:43:42,762 --> 01:43:45,407
Come on, we'll work it out somehow.
─ Get her out of here will you sucker.

1812
01:43:45,507 --> 01:43:47,037
Take her away some place. Any place.

1813
01:43:47,253 --> 01:43:49,612
Up in the mountains or somewhere
where there's lakes and stuff.

1814
01:43:50,389 --> 01:43:52,075
Just you two together and talk it out.

1815
01:43:52,510 --> 01:43:54,126
Only talk her out of my life, will you.

1816
01:43:54,572 --> 01:43:55,769
Talk her out of my life!

1817
01:43:56,622 --> 01:43:57,652
So long, Eager.

1818
01:44:48,401 --> 01:44:49,444
No, Johnny. Don't!

1819
01:44:50,901 --> 01:44:51,543
Hey!

1820
01:45:17,830 --> 01:45:18,623
Johnny!

1821
01:45:19,712 --> 01:45:20,530
Johnny.

1822
01:45:22,966 --> 01:45:23,713
Johnny.

1823
01:45:24,470 --> 01:45:25,323
Johnny.

1824
01:45:30,031 --> 01:45:31,026
Hello Jeff.

1825
01:45:32,918 --> 01:45:33,912
Hello Johnny.

1826
01:45:36,325 --> 01:45:37,261
Hey, Jeff.

1827
01:45:38,673 --> 01:45:40,117
What's that highest mountain?

1828
01:45:41,324 --> 01:45:42,409
Where we're going.

1829
01:45:42,781 --> 01:45:43,636
Why it's ..

1830
01:45:45,202 --> 01:45:46,231
What did he say?

1831
01:45:49,154 --> 01:45:50,610
He just asked about a mountain.

1832
01:45:51,271 --> 01:45:52,202
What mountain?

1833
01:45:52,548 --> 01:45:53,675
Do you know this guy?

1834
01:45:56,918 --> 01:45:57,660
Yeah.

1835
01:46:00,372 --> 01:46:03,774
This guy could have climbed the highest
mountain in the world if he'd ..

1836
01:46:04,551 --> 01:46:06,274
Just started up the right one.

1837
01:46:07,374 --> 01:46:09,776
Hello? Hello, Floyd, is that you?

1838
01:46:10,465 --> 01:46:11,727
Yeah, just getting home.

1839
01:46:12,185 --> 01:46:14,874
Say there äre four down in a gunfight
down here at Swandale and Kensington.

1840
01:46:15,950 --> 01:46:17,320
Yeah, I got the last of them.

1841
01:46:17,910 --> 01:46:19,099
His face looks familiar.

1842
01:46:19,993 --> 01:46:21,622
Oh, just añother hood, I guess.

1843
01:46:22,437 --> 01:46:24,772
Well, whoever he is, he don't
mean a thing to anybody now.

1844
01:46:25,148 --> 01:46:26,157
Much less to me.

1845
01:46:26,943 --> 01:46:28,935
Say, call Mae and tell
her I'll be late, will you.

1846
01:47:11,814 --> 01:47:12,797
