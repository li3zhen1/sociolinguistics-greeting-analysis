1
00:01:48,008 --> 00:01:50,705
Hi, Magic, have you been a good boy today?

2
00:01:50,744 --> 00:01:54,009
Oh! I've missed you.

3
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:12,228
Thank you!

4
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:10,948
Just a silly old tearjerker!

5
00:03:11,024 --> 00:03:13,584
What about getting dinner for
this hungry man of you

6
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,594
Really you have a heart of stone

7
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:27,565
Magic, you've been a brave boy today.

8
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:31,587
How about your favorite for my little here?

9
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:35,047
It's a tiny burned but you'll forgive me!

10
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,375
Kathy How long is it going to be - I'm starving!

11
00:03:41,021 --> 00:03:43,456
Hang on, just coming!

12
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:46,555
If you really want to eat

13
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:47,958
Don't just sit here like a bean bag!

14
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:49,238
Here try this, my special pork chop noodle.

15
00:03:49,262 --> 00:03:51,287
It's the best of world.

16
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:56,599
It's only bones; no meat &
what's the hell do with the noodle?

17
00:03:56,636 --> 00:03:58,570
Add half a pound of salt?

18
00:03:59,206 --> 00:04:02,232
Honey, sugar cubes, salt & a spoon.

19
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:03,902
Help yourself!

20
00:04:04,444 --> 00:04:06,276
Kathy!

21
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,819
Magic, sit.

22
00:04:17,557 --> 00:04:19,924
Don't be so rude

23
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:23,888
I'm sorry!

24
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:28,127
You always said you wanted
me to be honest with you?

25
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:31,832
Just a little advice on ways to improve
your cooking that's all.

26
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:33,533
Where's my earring.

27
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,268
Have you seen it?

28
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,902
Don't just stand there!

29
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:42,041
God, where's it!

30
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,641
Never mind, I'll buy you another pair!

31
00:04:48,755 --> 00:04:50,245
No, you don't understand.

32
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,816
This was a birthday gift from my mum before
she moved to the States.

33
00:04:52,893 --> 00:04:56,852
It's irreplaceable. How can I lose it?

34
00:04:57,497 --> 00:04:59,261
Have you kicked it away when you
were watching the football match?

35
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:01,266
No.

36
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,608
Thanks my little prince.

37
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:11,611
That dog really gets on my nerves he does

38
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,271
She's a fool for him.

39
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,645
Kathy, this is the most delicious coffee ever.

40
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:20,448
Don't overdo it.

41
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:23,046
I didn't make the coffee. It's instant.

42
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,615
You still boiled the water perfectly
to make good coffee.

43
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:27,956
Liar.

44
00:05:27,994 --> 00:05:29,484
You're still angry?

45
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:31,358
Let me give you a kiss!

46
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:45,270
My Magic wants a hug?

47
00:05:46,379 --> 00:05:48,939
I think you like that dog a lot more
than you like me.

48
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:52,144
Of course, he's not as phoney as you

49
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,845
I'm wrong if I'm honest and I'm wrong if
I exaggerate a little.

50
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,514
What can a guy do?

51
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,991
And you don't make it any easier for me!

52
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:08,426
Are we good friends, give me some face, OK'?

53
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,334
I've to kiss her.

54
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:17,172
Maggie, she's my girlfriend alright,
why can't I kiss her?

55
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:21,412
You're quite a rival, shithead!

56
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:33,257
Get lost, alright?

57
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,789
Not that dog again! What are you doing to Mary?

58
00:07:35,822 --> 00:07:37,381
I'm going to kill you!
I'll kill your dog!

59
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:42,254
Why don't you keep that dog tied up?
He's always chasing Mary.

60
00:07:42,329 --> 00:07:44,559
He even brought a bone with him today.
He's not very subtle.

61
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:46,190
I'll cut his balls off.

62
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:48,534
Magic.

63
00:07:49,936 --> 00:07:52,303
I'm very sorry. It won't happen again.

64
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:54,238
I'll take care of it, alright?

65
00:07:55,408 --> 00:08:00,175
Haha, well, that's great.
Alright, we'll forget it!

66
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:02,882
Yes, indeed.

67
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:08,887
Magic, how could you?

68
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:10,855
She's a virgin!

69
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,460
They're g0ifl9-

70
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:38,247
It's too late, they're for the chop!

71
00:08:48,995 --> 00:08:51,020
That's the end of your love-life!

72
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:03,775
I said took him for a walk.
I didn't ask you to

73
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,876
I did it for your sake.

74
00:09:05,945 --> 00:09:08,004
Look, he won't be a nuisance any more.

75
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:11,051
Your neighbor's not gonna complain about!

76
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:13,085
I have to fly to the States and
I want to see my parents.

77
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:16,851
I won't be back for a week.
I'd like you to take care of Magic.

78
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:30,800
Here's a list of his needs.

79
00:09:30,870 --> 00:09:35,205
He has a can of "Good Boy" dog food
in the morning and

80
00:09:35,675 --> 00:09:37,507
He has the dried food at night, exercise at 6 pm.

81
00:09:37,544 --> 00:09:38,807
Don't forget.

82
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,539
Oh yes, Jack, just because I'm not here,

83
00:09:40,613 --> 00:09:43,173
don't think you can drink and smoke
with your friends.

84
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:47,208
You can trust me! I know
you don't like it so I won't do it.

85
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:52,950
Now listen, Magic, you be a good dog.

86
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,824
Let him take care of you for a few days.

87
00:09:54,861 --> 00:09:56,955
If he doesn't treat you nicely,
complain to me when I get back.

88
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,625
Don't worry, I'll deal with him,
I'll get revenge for you.

89
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:14,373
Jungle Jungle

90
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,480
It's so comfort

91
00:10:18,885 --> 00:10:22,253
Big-ass, low down please.

92
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,421
They're arrived.

93
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:44,036
Go and look at yourself.

94
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:47,978
That's a girl's style.

95
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:57,354
My mother has never treat me like this before.

96
00:11:06,866 --> 00:11:09,233
What? Does it mean that
I've to obey to your master?

97
00:11:09,302 --> 00:11:12,863
I won't listen, so what?

98
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:15,270
Follow me.

99
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:29,782
Ok guys, it's party time.

100
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,792
Let's all get drunk!

101
00:11:36,396 --> 00:11:38,558
Whatever you want, we've got it!

102
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:44,631
Each for everyone.

103
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:45,866
Jack, I want it too.

104
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:47,839
Kathy's only been gone for half an hour

105
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:50,119
And we're really having a good time together.

106
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:52,942
But she's left that dog, and he's watching.

107
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:58,016
PIZZA...

108
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,999
Hey, Magic go away. Leave us alone.

109
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:18,698
Get away, wretched dog!

110
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:23,742
He doesn't like all the fun.
Take care he's going to report rat on us.

111
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:27,473
<i>Go away...</i>

112
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:41,353
What's all this? Who dealt this damn hand?

113
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:43,426
Getting ready to lose?

114
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,725
I think I will.

115
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,992
You...

116
00:12:51,104 --> 00:12:54,335
I think he must be hungry. I forget to feed him.

117
00:12:54,574 --> 00:12:56,702
Forget the dog. We're playing a game!

118
00:12:56,743 --> 00:12:57,869
He can wait!

119
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,743
He won't die if he's not fed.
I'll die if we don't start.

120
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:02,508
What's it?
Nine.

121
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:05,550
What nine?
Diamond nine.

122
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,721
There's a fire!

123
00:13:25,438 --> 00:13:28,999
My face is on fire.

124
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:35,211
I must be drunk.

125
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:42,946
It's a little photo of you and
Lucy kissing each other.

126
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:46,253
Give me back.

127
00:13:46,392 --> 00:13:48,554
Come, you bastard! Hand it over!
Come on, give it to me!

128
00:13:48,628 --> 00:13:52,587
Go for it, Jack! Lucy wanted
your ass for a long time.

129
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,307
We'll make ourselves at home.

130
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:03,274
Go <i>&</i> enjoy it!

131
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:05,304
Hey, drink up!

132
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:09,674
What are you doing?

133
00:14:09,749 --> 00:14:12,446
Just giving Magic little bit of fun.

134
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:16,488
Better give him more than that then!

135
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:19,890
Hey, good show!

136
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:37,938
The show is soon coming.

137
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:03,602
What's wrong?

138
00:15:03,636 --> 00:15:06,662
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Kathy!

139
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:08,970
I'm Lucy not Kathy!

140
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,512
He couldn't get it up,
and I think it's all your fault.

141
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:25,520
Alright Lucy, why not let one of us do it!

142
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,162
The 2 dogs have gone!

143
00:17:19,238 --> 00:17:21,206
I'm a happy ghost.

144
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,834
You've just saved my temple.

145
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:26,743
If not for you then all this could have
gone in smoke.

146
00:17:27,847 --> 00:17:32,045
Happy ghost never remembers bad things.

147
00:17:32,118 --> 00:17:33,813
But I'll always remember my benefactor.

148
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,820
Now you've saved my temple.

149
00:17:35,888 --> 00:17:39,222
I'm indebted to you.

150
00:17:39,325 --> 00:17:42,784
No matter what it is.

151
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,297
I'm going to give you a reward.

152
00:17:45,364 --> 00:17:47,423
Make a wish!

153
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,461
To be a man?

154
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,139
No I'm sorry.

155
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,143
You want me to change fate.

156
00:18:00,713 --> 00:18:02,340
I mustn't fiddle with destiny.

157
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:06,147
You've be human 1 day - you've got
a lot of karma to burn off first.

158
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,277
Listen it isn't good avoiding karma your know

159
00:18:08,354 --> 00:18:10,914
It always ends in tears.

160
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,386
Listen, what about something else

161
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:15,655
Wouldn't you rather have a bag of bones?

162
00:18:15,861 --> 00:18:17,386
You sure about this 7

163
00:18:18,998 --> 00:18:20,124
A human?

164
00:18:20,566 --> 00:18:22,591
You're certain?

165
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:27,135
Alright, and you're totally intent on being human?

166
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:31,399
I can do it for 49 days,
after that it's dog again.

167
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,846
Are you in agreement?

168
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,511
Nice dog. Nice dog!

169
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:03,365
Buddha Buddha ...

170
00:19:04,410 --> 00:19:08,278
You can't be naked,
I'll have to find you something to wear.

171
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:18,717
No, don't sit there begging.
As a man you'll have to stand up.

172
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,418
So, stand up!

173
00:19:21,761 --> 00:19:25,288
You still stand like a dog.
Look, put your paws down

174
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,493
Ah, let's learn do talk.

175
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:32,071
Now you can start speaking,
open your mouth and try.

176
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,373
You must talk, not bark. It's quite simple.

177
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:39,606
You just think & say it.

178
00:19:39,945 --> 00:19:41,743
|...

179
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,309
You're not getting it exactly.

180
00:19:44,350 --> 00:19:47,809
Relax! Alright.
Do some different shapes with your mouth.

181
00:19:47,853 --> 00:19:51,585
I'm in .
Pain

182
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:53,991
Now, maybe this'll encourage you.

183
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,162
And what's your name then?

184
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,502
Magic I

185
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,839
That's badge, or is it magic?

186
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:13,846
Come on then Magic.

187
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:22,652
Be careful!

188
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:34,930
You must remember, you can only remain
a human for 49 days.

189
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,231
One more thing, don't tell anyone
you're really a dog.

190
00:20:38,304 --> 00:20:40,295
It has to remain our secret.

191
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,703
<i>Or</i>

192
00:20:41,774 --> 00:20:42,935
You'll be a duck in your next life.

193
00:20:43,008 --> 00:20:44,271
You got that?

194
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,445
<i>You can't pee against lampposts anymore.</i>

195
00:20:48,514 --> 00:20:50,107
You have to go in there.

196
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,069
Do you miss your mistress while <i>she's</i> away?

197
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,467
Yes.

198
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,268
She hasn't come home yet, we'll return.

199
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,680
Magic, being human isn't easy.

200
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:30,815
Perhaps you've heard of this,
that is a man works from sun to sun.

201
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:36,418
While you were a dog, you were safe.
Life was handled for you.

202
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:40,056
As a man now, you'll have to work.

203
00:21:40,232 --> 00:21:41,666
You need a job.

204
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:43,566
Work?

205
00:21:44,537 --> 00:21:45,368
I'm not so sure.

206
00:21:45,437 --> 00:21:48,031
No need to worry, it's easy getting a job.

207
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:49,666
Here.

208
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:52,034
In you go!

209
00:21:55,114 --> 00:21:56,878
What is it?
Can I work here?

210
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,608
Can I work here?

211
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:05,456
Don't look at me. To him, I'm invisible.

212
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,120
Come on then!

213
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,464
Mr. Chan, this guy wants a job.

214
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,262
Fine, I'll talk to him.

215
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,140
Good evening sir.

216
00:22:26,612 --> 00:22:28,171
Sit down.

217
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,549
Sit down.

218
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:35,411
Sit straight.

219
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:37,478
You're sitting like a dog!

220
00:22:37,823 --> 00:22:39,450
Sit straight.

221
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:41,926
You're sitting like a dog!

222
00:22:42,194 --> 00:22:44,561
No him. I was talking to you!

223
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:47,029
No him. I was talking to you!

224
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:51,002
Listen you nerd, I don't care who
you're talking to, you'll ...

225
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,765
Listen, shut up!

226
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:56,070
Stop begging, sit down.

227
00:22:58,744 --> 00:23:00,337
What was I saying?

228
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:02,513
You were asking my name.

229
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,941
You were asking my name.

230
00:23:04,984 --> 00:23:06,145
Oh right, well, what is it?

231
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,481
I'm called Magic.

232
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,588
Tell him your name's Jacky Chan.

233
00:23:10,256 --> 00:23:11,883
My name's Jacky Chan.

234
00:23:11,957 --> 00:23:13,516
Why sure it is.

235
00:23:13,592 --> 00:23:15,356
You got an ID card?

236
00:23:18,297 --> 00:23:20,561
You're an illegal then.

237
00:23:20,633 --> 00:23:22,226
I'm a hard worker!

238
00:23:22,268 --> 00:23:23,531
I'm a hard worker!

239
00:23:23,569 --> 00:23:25,833
As night watchman and cleaner.

240
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:28,067
A thousand dollars a month.
Do you think you can handle?

241
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,801
How is it?

242
00:23:32,711 --> 00:23:36,011
Well don't let me down.
Alright, go and get started

243
00:23:36,048 --> 00:23:37,447
Up and running.

244
00:23:37,516 --> 00:23:41,350
Well enjoy your time and good luck
<i>as a</i> human being.

245
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,854
Take care.

246
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:44,951
Hey ... ..you ...

247
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:48,392
This is what you wanted, you're a human being!

248
00:23:56,802 --> 00:23:58,270
Hey, I need you over there.

249
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,601
Now, pile up these soft drinks.

250
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,048
Hey, come on.

251
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:21,292
Over there, come.

252
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,531
He's heading for trouble!

253
00:24:29,635 --> 00:24:31,501
Walks like a dog!

254
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,064
Good day sir!

255
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:35,572
You could learn from him.

256
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:38,440
Eats like a mouse, works like a horse.

257
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:41,536
Never answer back, not like you, bunch of duffers.

258
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:44,049
You guys eat like horses.
Think hard work'll kill you.

259
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:47,313
And talk all day like a load of starlings

260
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:52,418
Yes, I'm impressed with him.

261
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,459
This new guy's a winner.

262
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:01,694
He works his best off but why?

263
00:25:01,767 --> 00:25:03,599
To prove he's better than us, heard what he said.

264
00:25:03,635 --> 00:25:05,399
Let's put an end to it.

265
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:09,603
Hurry! Don't linger!

266
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:11,501
Get a move on! That's it keep going.

267
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,379
Don't waste time!

268
00:25:18,217 --> 00:25:19,912
Tired? You look pooped.

269
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:22,922
Why don't you take a rest.
The guys'|| finish up for you.

270
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:24,252
Good.

271
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:27,255
You look thirsty. How about a milk?

272
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:28,418
No thanks. Water's fine.

273
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,386
No need to drink water.
We can have anything we like.

274
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:32,897
After all we work here, that's right,
isn't it boys?

275
00:25:32,965 --> 00:25:35,525
Yeah, here!

276
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:40,972
How about canned fish?

277
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,667
And this!

278
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:45,911
Eats dog food?

279
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:53,214
He's from China, they eats dogs there,
he thinks it's canned dog.

280
00:25:56,822 --> 00:25:59,291
Eat up. And take your time.

281
00:25:59,425 --> 00:26:01,450
We'll go and work!

282
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,997
There he is. Look at him sir!

283
00:26:11,103 --> 00:26:13,128
Making it look he's working hard.

284
00:26:13,172 --> 00:26:15,470
And we have to do everything,
all he does is waste time.

285
00:26:15,541 --> 00:26:19,409
You see I wasn't lying. He does nothing!

286
00:26:19,678 --> 00:26:22,807
You waste time? Comes off your pay!

287
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,944
Got it!

288
00:26:29,221 --> 00:26:31,656
What? You lost Magic?

289
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:35,688
I haven't any idea where he went to.

290
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,353
I woke up and he wasn't with me.

291
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,591
Last time you looked after him you lost his balls.

292
00:26:39,665 --> 00:26:42,999
This time you've gone and lost the whole dog!

293
00:26:43,135 --> 00:26:45,502
I've looked for him everywhere.

294
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:47,039
Stop the car!

295
00:26:48,841 --> 00:26:50,605
Kathy, look. I'm really sorry!

296
00:26:50,676 --> 00:26:52,804
Where are you going?

297
00:26:53,512 --> 00:26:54,775
Taxi!

298
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,341
Kathy ...

299
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:02,314
Kathy ...

300
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:09,892
Pal!

301
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:14,063
Where are you going?

302
00:27:16,068 --> 00:27:19,698
Cousre you don't talk human,
OK I'll talk dog then.

303
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,842
I'm called Magic. And how about you?

304
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:29,711
I'm Spotty Dick. I guard the pharmacy.

305
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:31,044
How is it?

306
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,617
It's OK, they're nice people.

307
00:27:33,719 --> 00:27:35,209
So he's finished up.

308
00:27:35,954 --> 00:27:37,479
Look over there.

309
00:27:43,829 --> 00:27:45,923
Do you think what we did to him, upset him?

310
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,030
Well he isn't seen nothing yet.

311
00:27:48,066 --> 00:27:49,500
I agree guy5_

312
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:54,002
Who are those 3 guys anyway?

313
00:27:54,039 --> 00:27:55,097
Just idiots.

314
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,437
Some people.

315
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,033
Right, not all though. I like my mistress.

316
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:00,204
Is she kind?
Yeah, very.

317
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:03,442
The old guy at the pharmacy taught me to do this.

318
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,916
Can you do it?

319
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:08,010
No. I'm too heavy for that.
But I can catch a ball. Can you do that?

320
00:28:08,053 --> 00:28:11,114
And I've been in a car too!

321
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:49,961
Who is it?

322
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:56,427
What are you doing?

323
00:29:05,277 --> 00:29:08,212
Come on guys, stock up!

324
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:10,104
Let's have some cognac!

325
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:12,903
Yeah ...

326
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:18,546
Where's Fatty Turtle'?
Who knows?

327
00:30:30,495 --> 00:30:31,985
Take more!

328
00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:46,711
Take more!
What? Stealing?

329
00:30:49,047 --> 00:30:50,276
Ghost!

330
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:10,860
Help! Ghost!

331
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:18,236
What's the matter!

332
00:32:54,639 --> 00:32:57,973
I did a little bit of ghostly magic,
those guys need a bit lesson.

333
00:32:58,043 --> 00:33:02,173
Let's hope they learned
what's right & what's wrong.

334
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:12,880
I didn't know people were like that.

335
00:33:13,258 --> 00:33:15,750
Well they aren't all so, don't you worry.

336
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:18,362
Change me back,
I don't want to be human any more.

337
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,760
Absolutely no way at all.

338
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:25,768
I asked all that is for special permission.

339
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,772
You haven't even done 1 month
you can't just give up like this.

340
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,866
Come on.
How would I be able to face All the Gods?

341
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:33,844
You mean I've to stay like this'?

342
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:36,036
It isn't as bad <i>as</i> all that really.

343
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:40,382
In a little time you'll get
the hang of it <i>&</i> it'll be just fine.

344
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,446
Happy Ghost!

345
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:53,289
Pass me that come on.

346
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:55,824
What's the matter.

347
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,460
You're the matter!

348
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:08,940
Do you want dog food?

349
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,005
That's right. I don't know which one I want to.

350
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,346
That one's full of gristle, I never want to.

351
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:14,714
This, here is my favorite.

352
00:34:14,753 --> 00:34:16,778
Full cut prime beef. It's wonderful!

353
00:34:16,821 --> 00:34:18,687
Really? You eat it?

354
00:34:18,757 --> 00:34:20,623
Yeah! It's the best one.
It's got all the nutrition!

355
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,351
Need for a nice wet nose.

356
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:24,862
And a wiggly tail too.

357
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:57,051
Excuse me, how much is this please?

358
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,654
I'm sorry, I don't know.

359
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:21,813
Kathy!

360
00:35:22,621 --> 00:35:23,952
Kathy?

361
00:35:24,289 --> 00:35:27,190
I'm sorry.

362
00:35:28,159 --> 00:35:29,524
Are you blind?

363
00:35:29,761 --> 00:35:31,525
I'll pick it up.

364
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:38,136
The windows need cleaning - please go <i>&</i> do it!

365
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:40,136
The windows need cleaning - please go <i>&</i> do it!

366
00:35:40,405 --> 00:35:42,931
I'm very sorry boss.
Thank you.

367
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:48,676
Mummy! Kathy!

368
00:35:50,382 --> 00:35:51,213
Kathy ...

369
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:54,343
Looks a bit old to have lost his mummy.
Kathy!

370
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,822
Mind what you're doing.

371
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:14,396
Theft!
Theft!

372
00:36:29,788 --> 00:36:32,621
Get up

373
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:34,056
Are you alright?

374
00:36:34,859 --> 00:36:37,954
Is your head alright sir? You'd go to hospital.

375
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,863
I didn't have the chance to find out your name.

376
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:45,300
My name is Kathy.

377
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:47,429
I'm Magic.
What coincidence!

378
00:36:47,505 --> 00:36:50,304
Magic was the name of my dog too.

379
00:36:50,709 --> 00:36:53,542
I didn't mean to say that you're a dog.

380
00:36:53,611 --> 00:36:54,772
No really I ...

381
00:36:54,913 --> 00:36:56,813
Alright, Magic be quiet.

382
00:36:57,816 --> 00:36:59,409
Doctor, how is he?

383
00:36:59,484 --> 00:37:01,213
He's fine, just minor wounds.

384
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:03,949
I'll give an anti-tetanus shot & he'll be OK.

385
00:37:04,022 --> 00:37:05,649
Thank you.

386
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:08,290
I'm glad you're alright.

387
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:09,849
I know I caused you all these troubles

388
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:12,192
& I don't know how to repay you.

389
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:18,326
To tell you the truth I ...

390
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:24,039
Here we are.
Thank you.

391
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:28,672
Didn't you've something to tell me? What's it?
I ...

392
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,550
You'd not tell others the secret, or ...

393
00:37:32,617 --> 00:37:34,847
You'll become a duck in your next life.

394
00:37:35,019 --> 00:37:37,147
I can't tell you or |'ll turn into a duck.

395
00:37:37,222 --> 00:37:38,621
A duck?

396
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:41,192
Nice car nice dame!

397
00:37:41,259 --> 00:37:45,253
This's during working hours
we'd learn a thing or two from ou.

398
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,230
See you.
Bye bye!

399
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:51,531
Don't let us hold you up, come on!

400
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:54,430
What's all this?

401
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:57,241
You can't just come <i>&</i> go <i>as</i>
you see fit young man.

402
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:59,243
I can replace you very easily.

403
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:00,709
But I was in an accident,
it wasn't what you think.

404
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:03,924
She didn't look like an accident!
We think she's gorgeous!

405
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:05,575
She had her bag snatched ...

406
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,984
And along came sir Galahad!

407
00:38:08,186 --> 00:38:10,052
Without his armour or his horse?!

408
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:12,317
You're fired. I don't need to hear anything more.

409
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,950
This's all you get, get out of here.

410
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:16,824
Get lost ...

411
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:21,695
But boss ... ..
Alright get your shirt off!

412
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:23,256
What am I going to do now'?

413
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,859
She'll keep you busy!

414
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:31,465
Magic, get in, |'ll find
you a better job than this one.

415
00:38:31,543 --> 00:38:33,170
Come on!

416
00:38:44,355 --> 00:38:46,756
Michelle!

417
00:38:46,791 --> 00:38:49,192
Family!

418
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:51,724
Old friend?

419
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:53,161
Family?

420
00:38:54,499 --> 00:38:57,935
Is this the guy you told me about
the one who wants a job?

421
00:38:58,036 --> 00:38:59,231
He's a hard worker.

422
00:38:59,304 --> 00:39:01,932
Old friend!

423
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,599
The job is quite easy actually.

424
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,904
You just have to like animals.

425
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:07,637
But he does have to sleep here <i>as</i> well.

426
00:39:07,712 --> 00:39:10,147
Don't worry, he knows all about that.

427
00:39:11,282 --> 00:39:14,013
He looks like a man after my own heart.

428
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:15,553
Michelle, Gigi's not well today.

429
00:39:15,687 --> 00:39:17,951
She won't do pee pee or eat.

430
00:39:18,022 --> 00:39:18,887
She ate yesterday?

431
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:21,392
Yes, her usual chicken <i>&</i> brawn rice.

432
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:25,621
Yes, you've to be careful.

433
00:39:25,663 --> 00:39:26,789
Let's get her to a vet, maybe its serious.

434
00:39:26,865 --> 00:39:29,009
A vet? Loosen my collar!

435
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:30,694
Relax.

436
00:39:30,735 --> 00:39:34,763
It's her collar, it's too tight. Let's loosen it.

437
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,802
It's so nice!

438
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:44,548
It's better!

439
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:47,212
How did you know'?

440
00:39:47,252 --> 00:39:49,050
I did what she told me.

441
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:52,882
You've a very strange sense of humor.

442
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:56,221
I'm happy I can breathe again.

443
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:09,103
Kid...
What?

444
00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:10,741
Want to eat something?

445
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:14,368
Eat or not?

446
00:40:14,445 --> 00:40:15,970
No.

447
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,921
A mini typhoon!

448
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:36,531
Delicious!

449
00:40:37,135 --> 00:40:38,967
Not this again.

450
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:41,637
Someone is coming.

451
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:43,840
Maisie's got the grumps,

452
00:40:43,908 --> 00:40:46,002
I don't know what's the matter with her.

453
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:47,341
Can you help?

454
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:49,513
What do you expect with that hair style?

455
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:50,912
I hate it!

456
00:40:50,982 --> 00:40:53,961
She's to wear it like this'd
all the rage over in Italy.

457
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:55,043
I'm not in Italy!

458
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:57,952
I hate this hair style.

459
00:40:58,022 --> 00:41:01,788
Yes, but Maisie hates it,
she feels that she looks stupid.

460
00:41:01,993 --> 00:41:03,791
He understands me!

461
00:41:04,195 --> 00:41:06,493
Dogs don't find this beautiful.

462
00:41:06,531 --> 00:41:07,760
Try <i>&</i> imagine being a dog
you'd not like this, right

463
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:08,798
Right Winston?

464
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:09,977
It's ugly -'Maisie's a dog not a toy'.

465
00:41:10,001 --> 00:41:11,628
Stupid!

466
00:41:11,936 --> 00:41:13,370
What can I do about it?

467
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:17,000
First of all, take all these silly clips out.

468
00:41:17,075 --> 00:41:19,976
And let her hair grow naturally.

469
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:21,069
That's right!

470
00:41:21,612 --> 00:41:22,841
Get her to take this horrible coat off.

471
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:26,441
I hate this coat! Horrible!

472
00:41:26,517 --> 00:41:28,349
And let me roll in cows hit sometimes

473
00:41:28,386 --> 00:41:30,047
Well, |'ll do what you said

474
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:31,950
He understands me.

475
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:34,592
Thanks a lot.

476
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:38,626
Come on Maisie, let's return
you back into a real dog.

477
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,665
Hi Magic

478
00:41:43,968 --> 00:41:45,367
Michelle.
Hi Kathy

479
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:47,729
Look, he's amazing.

480
00:41:47,905 --> 00:41:49,771
Aren't you glad you're not a poodle'?

481
00:41:49,841 --> 00:41:51,002
But I wish I was a bit more handsome.

482
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:52,270
You are handsome!

483
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:53,175
Really!

484
00:41:53,211 --> 00:41:56,670
That's great! He's been here
for one week <i>&</i> now a raise.

485
00:41:57,115 --> 00:42:00,983
<i>I don't like his dress sense,
those</i> funny <i>old</i> pajama <i>he wears!</i>

486
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:01,712
If I give you some money.

487
00:42:01,886 --> 00:42:04,548
Can you make him presentable?

488
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:11,995
Can you read this'?

489
00:42:15,433 --> 00:42:17,060
And so now?

490
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,029
How about now?

491
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,468
Can you see this one?

492
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:31,014
Why can't you? You must be blind.

493
00:42:31,983 --> 00:42:33,280
What's this?

494
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:36,718
O...

495
00:42:36,821 --> 00:42:38,255
O right?

496
00:42:40,124 --> 00:42:41,853
O right? So you're blind then.

497
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:45,794
But I can see the letters,
I don't know what they are.

498
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:50,568
20 minutes.

499
00:43:53,131 --> 00:43:54,997
Hi!

500
00:43:57,902 --> 00:43:59,961
What's the matter with him?

501
00:44:01,739 --> 00:44:02,831
Smartie!

502
00:44:04,342 --> 00:44:05,605
<i>He kissed me'.!</i>

503
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:08,036
He is so smart!

504
00:44:09,280 --> 00:44:10,748
I love you

505
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:13,081
ROSE <i>*</i> MARY

506
00:44:16,354 --> 00:44:20,382
That's the thing with dogs,
they do exactly what they like.

507
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:26,892
Sir

508
00:44:29,734 --> 00:44:33,466
This restaurant is famous for its steak,
have you ever been here before?

509
00:44:34,272 --> 00:44:36,707
Never, they wouldn't let me in.

510
00:44:36,774 --> 00:44:39,243
Why not?

511
00:44:41,279 --> 00:44:43,179
I... ...I don't have the money.

512
00:44:43,748 --> 00:44:46,012
This time it's my treat.

513
00:44:53,157 --> 00:44:56,491
Their fillet mignon with butter & garlic
is the house specialty here.

514
00:44:56,594 --> 00:44:58,289
Try!

515
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:42,195
Jack, this is Magic,
the one who got my purse back.

516
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:44,331
Magic, meet Jack.

517
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,979
Magic, what's the matter'?

518
00:45:58,823 --> 00:46:00,291
Hi!

519
00:46:13,871 --> 00:46:15,236
Have you eaten yet?

520
00:46:16,007 --> 00:46:19,272
Yes I have, don't forget
your playing tennis with me.

521
00:46:19,844 --> 00:46:22,142
Magic, can you play tennis?

522
00:46:22,413 --> 00:46:26,008
Well that settles it, we're going to teach
you how to play.

523
00:46:27,318 --> 00:46:28,615
Madam, anything else.

524
00:46:28,686 --> 00:46:30,381
That's all, thank you.

525
00:46:36,027 --> 00:46:38,223
Waiter, bill please.

526
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:45,133
Do you still want it?

527
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:22,666
Magic, your turn.

528
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:25,370
Jack, won't you let Magic at least try?

529
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:28,373
Ru play with him.

530
00:47:28,446 --> 00:47:30,437
You're tired anyway, just take a rest.

531
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:33,747
Magic you go <i>&</i> play a while.

532
00:47:34,151 --> 00:47:36,279
Jack, It's no fun for him sitting here,
you play with him.

533
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:37,378
Jack will teach you.

534
00:47:37,455 --> 00:47:40,186
OK!
I'll get ice cream.

535
00:49:57,795 --> 00:49:59,889
Serve you right!

536
00:50:09,707 --> 00:50:12,677
I surrender.

537
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:20,873
Ice cream.

538
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,679
Did you play?

539
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:29,589
He learns fast. He's almost <i>as</i> good <i>as</i> me.

540
00:50:39,103 --> 00:50:41,470
I've lost my earring again. Help me lind it.

541
00:50:42,673 --> 00:50:44,607
Honey, it's such a big place here.

542
00:50:44,675 --> 00:50:45,972
Let me buy you another pair?

543
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:48,944
They have sentimental value,
they were from my mother.

544
00:50:49,079 --> 00:50:51,173
So we spend the rest of the evening here.

545
00:50:52,049 --> 00:50:54,575
I know where to find
a pair that's exactly the same.

546
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:56,313
Nobody could tell the difference.

547
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:58,321
I could tell the difference

548
00:50:59,523 --> 00:51:01,184
Look! I've found it!

549
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,592
Here it is! Well, is this it?

550
00:51:08,666 --> 00:51:09,792
Yes.

551
00:51:10,134 --> 00:51:13,536
It's been in the drain, it's got to be washed.

552
00:51:14,972 --> 00:51:16,406
We'll go & fetch the car.

553
00:51:16,507 --> 00:51:19,408
Do we've to have that jerk with us for the night?

554
00:51:40,064 --> 00:51:40,929
Here it's clean.

555
00:51:40,965 --> 00:51:43,059
Did you wash it in the swimming pool then?

556
00:51:45,803 --> 00:51:47,237
Thank you!

557
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,178
Thank you!

558
00:52:03,721 --> 00:52:05,382
Jack, just a minute.

559
00:52:06,824 --> 00:52:08,519
Have you lost your key?

560
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:13,260
Yes, it must be in my other clothes, the old one.

561
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:15,095
This excuses this guy, comes up with.

562
00:52:15,165 --> 00:52:17,497
So you don't have anywhere to sleep tonight?

563
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:22,005
Well, he can't stay over at my place

564
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:24,734
Alright, he can stay over at my place then.

565
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:27,600
This way.

566
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,212
Don't be shy, just make yourself at home.

567
00:52:32,282 --> 00:52:35,217
Jackie a good guy.

568
00:52:38,956 --> 00:52:41,687
Jack, Magic can sleep in the study I'll fix it up.

569
00:52:41,759 --> 00:52:43,227
Well, I'll do the room later.

570
00:52:43,293 --> 00:52:44,385
I'll take you home first.

571
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:47,293
It's alright, I'll take a cab,
I'll call you when I'm home.

572
00:52:48,232 --> 00:52:49,563
Goodnight, Magic.

573
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,468
Look after him, won't you?

574
00:52:51,535 --> 00:52:52,900
Yes honey.

575
00:53:01,378 --> 00:53:03,676
Boy, I've to hand it to you,
you may look like a 4-eyed nerd.

576
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:06,648
From nowhere but you sure know how
to get in on a good thing.

577
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:10,052
And as for calling yourself
Magic go to the top of the class.

578
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:12,885
You really scored a lot of brownie points there,
didn't you?

579
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:15,551
But get this, she's my girl has been for 3 years,

580
00:53:15,592 --> 00:53:16,821
And don't forget it.

581
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:19,627
Where are you going?

582
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:21,327
To sleep in the study.

583
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:23,924
You'll sleep right where you are, the sofa.

584
00:53:24,234 --> 00:53:25,998
You better be warned because I'm serious.

585
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:27,265
I hate rivals, I'm going to out your balls off.

586
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:28,736
Just like I did to her dog.

587
00:53:28,806 --> 00:53:31,036
If you hang around her any more.

588
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,180
No need to sleep on the sofa,
why don't you come in the study?

589
00:53:37,781 --> 00:53:39,340
What are you doing here?

590
00:53:39,783 --> 00:53:42,445
I took your key home by mistake, I'm returning it.

591
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:43,748
Thank you.

592
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:51,420
Why don't I take you out <i>&</i> help you find a taxi?

593
00:54:01,271 --> 00:54:02,500
What's that?

594
00:54:08,479 --> 00:54:11,278
Jack, while I was away what did you do?

595
00:54:12,883 --> 00:54:14,180
You...

596
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:16,819
Kathy come back, I can explain!

597
00:54:17,421 --> 00:54:20,755
Look you know I love you Kathy.

598
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:22,758
What's the matter?

599
00:54:22,960 --> 00:54:24,485
Don't move!

600
00:54:24,895 --> 00:54:26,727
I've been with you for 3 years now.

601
00:54:26,797 --> 00:54:28,822
Kathy, listen, you know I love you.

602
00:54:30,434 --> 00:54:32,163
Listen, I can explain!

603
00:54:33,971 --> 00:54:36,406
I'm not interested in any other girls.

604
00:54:36,540 --> 00:54:37,871
Get away from me.

605
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:40,638
Stop following me around like a stupid dog.

606
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:42,371
I'm the dog!

607
00:54:42,446 --> 00:54:43,914
Why you hanging around?

608
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,779
I'm talking to you, not him!

609
00:54:45,816 --> 00:54:47,113
Mel?

610
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:54,484
You'll regret this, Kathy I promise!

611
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:01,664
Alright, can't win all.

612
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:05,530
Come on.

613
00:55:06,937 --> 00:55:08,098
Your place or mine'?

614
00:55:08,172 --> 00:55:10,072
Not you.

615
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:12,374
Excuse me.

616
00:55:30,394 --> 00:55:34,991
How did you know where my slippers were?

617
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,728
I just guessed, I guess ...

618
00:55:39,837 --> 00:55:41,100
Thank you.

619
00:55:43,974 --> 00:55:45,373
Sit down.

620
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:52,111
Let me get you something to eat.
Thanks.

621
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:08,430
What are you doing?

622
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:12,026
Nothing, I've never seen a bed like this before.

623
00:56:12,302 --> 00:56:14,270
It's really a nice bed, isn't it?

624
00:56:14,338 --> 00:56:16,204
There's another one just like
it in the guest room.

625
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:18,334
Would you mind waiting out there for me?

626
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:20,336
OK!

627
00:56:28,652 --> 00:56:30,711
Well, eat it.

628
00:56:31,989 --> 00:56:34,083
Should I make you something to go with it'?

629
00:56:34,191 --> 00:56:35,955
No need, I've got this.

630
00:56:38,962 --> 00:56:42,592
I don't know, but when I see you,
you give me this strange feeling,

631
00:56:42,633 --> 00:56:45,500
The feeling, I used to have with my dog Magic.

632
00:56:46,303 --> 00:56:48,681
I'm sorry, I don't mean to compare you to my dog.

633
00:56:48,705 --> 00:56:50,002
I'm sorry.

634
00:56:50,040 --> 00:56:52,600
Don't worry, your dog'll come back.

635
00:56:52,709 --> 00:56:54,438
It was all Jackie fault.

636
00:56:54,511 --> 00:56:56,070
If he'd had looked after Magic instead
of fooling around.

637
00:56:56,146 --> 00:56:59,081
It would never have happened.

638
00:56:59,116 --> 00:57:01,210
I never want to see him again.

639
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:08,781
See you tomorrow.

640
00:57:27,044 --> 00:57:31,413
Why'd I have to apolegise?

641
00:57:31,581 --> 00:57:35,040
She's got to be kidding,
she's not the only lish in the sea.

642
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:37,879
With my look & charm, straight up,
eat your heart out.

643
00:57:41,725 --> 00:57:43,193
Sleep!

644
00:57:57,007 --> 00:57:58,839
My God, I've to see her!

645
00:58:00,744 --> 00:58:02,143
That makes me look weak though.

646
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:03,976
No way, do I need aa woman'?

647
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:06,171
Sleep!

648
00:58:12,956 --> 00:58:14,185
You're here.

649
00:58:14,524 --> 00:58:16,492
Why not? Kathy's here as well.

650
00:58:16,526 --> 00:58:18,290
You mean you never went home last night?

651
00:58:18,362 --> 00:58:19,420
Well of course I didn't, I stayed with her.

652
00:58:19,496 --> 00:58:20,861
I did.

653
00:58:21,064 --> 00:58:22,259
Where did you sleep?

654
00:58:22,332 --> 00:58:24,130
Also. ..
What's it?

655
00:58:24,368 --> 00:58:25,699
We just stept together.

656
00:58:25,836 --> 00:58:27,031
Stept together?

657
00:58:27,070 --> 00:58:28,504
What is it?

658
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:30,732
What's the meaning of all these noise?

659
00:58:30,807 --> 00:58:35,005
Come here, I need to talk to you, Out!

660
00:58:39,316 --> 00:58:42,047
Lock out big boy?

661
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:43,746
Come on in.

662
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:51,892
Why is your bed such a mess'?

663
00:58:52,829 --> 00:58:54,797
And what's this? <i>2</i> pillows, why <i>2</i> pillows?

664
00:58:54,965 --> 00:58:56,330
Oh you didn't have company in bed, did you?

665
00:58:56,433 --> 00:58:57,867
One for you one for him!

666
00:58:57,934 --> 00:58:59,561
What are you talking about?

667
00:59:01,405 --> 00:59:03,499
Listen to that!

668
00:59:03,573 --> 00:59:05,234
Your voice is all bucky Kathy.

669
00:59:05,275 --> 00:59:07,243
You obviously didn't get any sleep last night!

670
00:59:07,444 --> 00:59:10,038
You are a real ass.

671
00:59:10,113 --> 00:59:12,047
This time you're insulting me & my friend.

672
00:59:12,082 --> 00:59:13,140
What friend?

673
00:59:13,450 --> 00:59:15,714
You hardly know the guy -
what is it a week at the most now.

674
00:59:15,786 --> 00:59:18,312
I've known you for 3 years.

675
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,356
Shut up, we've had 3 years.

676
00:59:20,424 --> 00:59:22,518
But how long have you'd with that woman'?

677
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:25,425
So you went to bed with that dog to spite me,
did you Kathy?

678
00:59:25,495 --> 00:59:27,122
Get out right now.

679
00:59:27,197 --> 00:59:29,291
I never want to see you again.

680
00:59:29,366 --> 00:59:32,199
I won't! I'm going to stay here.

681
00:59:33,537 --> 00:59:37,974
Out, get out!

682
00:59:41,044 --> 00:59:42,944
You...

683
00:59:50,053 --> 00:59:51,919
Hi, it's you!

684
00:59:53,190 --> 00:59:54,624
I love a man when he's angry.

685
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:56,216
Would you like to come over
here for a little drink?

686
00:59:56,326 --> 01:00:00,354
No! I wouldn't, what are you? A bitch'?
Get lost!

687
01:00:08,738 --> 01:00:09,830
You stop it!

688
01:00:10,073 --> 01:00:13,441
I'm pretty good at this!

689
01:00:13,877 --> 01:00:15,038
I'm outtalk here.

690
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,209
I'm lucky!

691
01:00:19,683 --> 01:00:21,583
Get away quickly!

692
01:00:24,254 --> 01:00:24,914
Stop it.

693
01:00:25,021 --> 01:00:27,251
No, Kathy, don't throw the fridge,
it's too heavy to kill him.

694
01:00:27,491 --> 01:00:29,084
I just want a drink.

695
01:00:35,866 --> 01:00:39,393
Magic, let's go to a party tonight.

696
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:47,634
Good heavens, he looks like the dog's dinner.

697
01:00:48,612 --> 01:00:52,276
Kathy did a good job really,
you do look so different.

698
01:00:52,315 --> 01:00:54,010
She even invited me to a party tonight.

699
01:00:54,818 --> 01:00:56,013
Uh? What about Jack?

700
01:00:56,119 --> 01:00:57,553
Excuse me!

701
01:00:58,889 --> 01:01:00,152
I'd like to buy a collar

702
01:01:00,223 --> 01:01:02,453
Of course, These are the new designs from Italy.

703
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:04,123
It's beatutiful

704
01:01:04,227 --> 01:01:05,922
It's snazzy!

705
01:01:07,464 --> 01:01:08,556
Just a minute.

706
01:01:08,798 --> 01:01:10,789
Can you wrap it up?

707
01:01:15,238 --> 01:01:16,569
Disgusting!

708
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,208
Who does he think he is?

709
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:21,542
You're just jealous.

710
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:25,476
You're so handsome!

711
01:01:26,249 --> 01:01:28,775
I like it, take it off my salary.

712
01:01:33,590 --> 01:01:36,560
This one's for Kathy, see you later.

713
01:01:41,031 --> 01:01:42,726
Why are you wearing a dog collar?

714
01:01:42,766 --> 01:01:45,599
You see dogs in sweaters,
why not men in dog collars'?

715
01:01:45,769 --> 01:01:48,704
Why not? Know what it's great!

716
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:50,570
This one's for you.

717
01:01:51,875 --> 01:01:53,434
Is it a fashion of this year?

718
01:01:53,743 --> 01:01:55,211
Not bad!

719
01:01:55,412 --> 01:01:58,507
And it matches my dress, Thanks.

720
01:02:12,028 --> 01:02:15,555
Hi!

721
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:17,258
Why not!

722
01:02:21,271 --> 01:02:22,966
What's happened? Who's Kathy with'?

723
01:02:23,540 --> 01:02:24,905
Hey, so who ditched who, Jack?

724
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:25,931
<i>Gross.</i>

725
01:02:44,661 --> 01:02:45,992
Disgusting.

726
01:02:52,736 --> 01:02:54,101
I'm sorry.

727
01:02:54,471 --> 01:02:56,269
Lucy, would you care to dance?

728
01:02:56,339 --> 01:02:58,068
Thank you.

729
01:02:58,141 --> 01:03:00,166
Jack is really something

730
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:08,849
Dance with me.

731
01:03:08,918 --> 01:03:10,010
I don't know how to.

732
01:03:10,053 --> 01:03:11,987
Never mind, I'll teach you.

733
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:16,092
I'm sorry.

734
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,553
Not up there, here.

735
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:22,254
Good! That's better.

736
01:03:55,065 --> 01:03:58,524
I'm sorry, I've to go to the washroom.

737
01:04:11,915 --> 01:04:13,644
What's it?

738
01:04:17,253 --> 01:04:20,348
Hi Magic, I'm John, a friend of Jack's.

739
01:04:20,390 --> 01:04:21,824
Shake your hand!

740
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:24,053
I'm George.

741
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:25,995
John, George.

742
01:04:26,029 --> 01:04:28,191
Like some snails? Delicious!

743
01:04:28,431 --> 01:04:32,026
Go on, dig it.

744
01:04:41,277 --> 01:04:42,802
Yummy

745
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:50,942
<i>(Wasabi)</i>

746
01:04:56,493 --> 01:04:59,326
Hey, buddy, someone invites you to sing.

747
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:02,058
Are you interested? Can you sing'?

748
01:05:30,827 --> 01:05:31,988
Jack!

749
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:37,227
Water at last!

750
01:05:37,634 --> 01:05:39,295
You really are something!

751
01:05:40,737 --> 01:05:42,728
I'm something at least I'm not a dog.

752
01:05:42,806 --> 01:05:43,898
Not like him!

753
01:05:44,207 --> 01:05:45,368
How do you know I'm a dog?

754
01:05:45,442 --> 01:05:47,433
Don't call yourself a dog.

755
01:05:47,510 --> 01:05:48,875
Anyone who jumps into bed with someone
elsefls girlfriend is a dog!

756
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:50,674
He is a dog!

757
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:52,412
What did you say?

758
01:05:56,553 --> 01:06:01,013
Sir...

759
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:02,588
Sir...

760
01:06:03,326 --> 01:06:05,920
Are you alright?

761
01:06:08,565 --> 01:06:09,896
Come on, let's go.

762
01:06:10,867 --> 01:06:12,266
Are you hurt?

763
01:06:12,402 --> 01:06:14,564
Howl hate him!

764
01:06:17,774 --> 01:06:20,368
You're becoming drunk, too much cognac!

765
01:06:20,443 --> 01:06:21,638
I hate him.

766
01:06:22,512 --> 01:06:26,380
You tell me, what's she got that I haven't got?

767
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:28,076
You're a nicer girl.

768
01:06:28,117 --> 01:06:29,084
And a lot cuter.

769
01:06:29,118 --> 01:06:32,418
Then why won't he tell the bitch to go?

770
01:06:35,291 --> 01:06:36,884
I'll get you some water.

771
01:06:43,132 --> 01:06:44,600
Vodka

772
01:06:45,635 --> 01:06:48,570
I want cognac!

773
01:06:49,239 --> 01:06:50,707
Drink this water

774
01:06:57,714 --> 01:07:00,945
You lie to me, I hate people who lie.

775
01:07:03,186 --> 01:07:04,551
I didn't really lie.

776
01:07:04,587 --> 01:07:05,782
I just twisted the truth.

777
01:07:06,055 --> 01:07:07,523
The truth is I'm your dog.

778
01:07:07,924 --> 01:07:08,891
D09

779
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:10,426
I know, you're an old dog?

780
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:13,928
I'm your dog!

781
01:07:14,264 --> 01:07:21,193
I like dog, dog is faithful.

782
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:28,109
Kathy ...

783
01:07:46,596 --> 01:07:47,927
Suppertime, guys!

784
01:07:47,997 --> 01:07:49,089
<i>Come 8» ea“!</i>

785
01:07:49,165 --> 01:07:50,360
I'm so hungry!

786
01:07:50,433 --> 01:07:53,892
Here it is, dinner delicious ...

787
01:07:53,970 --> 01:07:55,631
See this!

788
01:08:00,843 --> 01:08:03,369
It's fun being together, I love being a human.

789
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:04,938
I'm so hHPPY-

790
01:08:06,349 --> 01:08:07,646
<i>|</i> feel happy fOF Yo"-

791
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:10,412
Me too.

792
01:08:11,187 --> 01:08:12,814
I jealous you.

793
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:15,414
I envy you.

794
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,625
What do you think.

795
01:08:18,695 --> 01:08:21,255
I don't think it'll workout.

796
01:08:22,899 --> 01:08:24,731
Human are nothing but trouble.

797
01:08:24,968 --> 01:08:28,336
I don't speak dog, what's going on?

798
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:51,690
Bring me some chicken tomorrow.

799
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,792
Happy Ghost, can you help me please?

800
01:09:02,205 --> 01:09:05,539
Magic, how many times have I said it.

801
01:09:05,608 --> 01:09:08,339
Impossible to be a dog again before your time.

802
01:09:08,511 --> 01:09:09,706
But I don't want to be a dog.

803
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:11,280
I want to stay like this.

804
01:09:11,614 --> 01:09:13,480
Well, now that's even more difficult.

805
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:16,849
Reincarnation-wise,
you're pretty low down the ladder.

806
01:09:16,919 --> 01:09:19,718
Not long out of the plant kingdom,
so don't push your luck here.

807
01:09:19,789 --> 01:09:21,314
Even in your next life.

808
01:09:21,391 --> 01:09:23,257
You won't be human,
you got a lew more dog lives yet.

809
01:09:23,426 --> 01:09:26,885
You're very lucky you'd these 49 days.

810
01:09:26,963 --> 01:09:28,897
Don't upset the Gods,
or you may return as a grasshopper.

811
01:09:29,098 --> 01:09:30,930
But that feeling I've with my mistress.

812
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:32,900
The warmth & wonderfulness.

813
01:09:33,036 --> 01:09:36,199
It's not like being with
your average bitch at all.

814
01:09:36,472 --> 01:09:39,840
It's reserved for the human kingdom,
only human beings can have feelings like that.

815
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:41,673
They say I love you.

816
01:09:41,811 --> 01:09:42,573
Love you?

817
01:09:42,645 --> 01:09:45,945
Other than making money,

818
01:09:46,049 --> 01:09:48,575
Love motivates human to do anything,

819
01:09:48,618 --> 01:09:49,949
The trouble is ...

820
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:53,045
People just treat love & money in the same way.

821
01:09:53,122 --> 01:09:56,319
Think they can own love.

822
01:09:56,392 --> 01:09:57,985
When in fact it's a gift to give.

823
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:00,659
Many live, spent working that one out.

824
01:10:00,730 --> 01:10:01,492
But why?

825
01:10:01,597 --> 01:10:02,826
Just believe it.

826
01:10:02,932 --> 01:10:04,093
You try <i>&</i> control love.

827
01:10:04,167 --> 01:10:07,432
& you'll live to regret it.

828
01:10:08,805 --> 01:10:10,899
Come back, it's not true.

829
01:10:11,140 --> 01:10:12,437
I want love.

830
01:10:12,675 --> 01:10:14,700
I want love!

831
01:10:16,713 --> 01:10:18,545
I really like it here.

832
01:10:20,183 --> 01:10:23,244
I'm sorry sir, you're not allowed
to bring your dog in here.

833
01:10:26,589 --> 01:10:27,818
I can't go in.

834
01:10:27,924 --> 01:10:30,859
What's the matter with you? You're not a dog.

835
01:10:30,960 --> 01:10:32,485
That's right, I'm not a dog.

836
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:34,223
Let's go in.

837
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:38,893
Magic, would you like a hot dog?

838
01:10:38,935 --> 01:10:40,630
A dog? I can't eat a dog!

839
01:10:40,703 --> 01:10:42,762
Not a dog, a hot dog.

840
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:44,236
It doesn't matter if it's hot or cold.

841
01:10:44,307 --> 01:10:46,207
I just don't eat it.

842
01:10:46,576 --> 01:10:48,066
Two hot dogs please.

843
01:10:52,515 --> 01:10:55,951
Eat up! It's sausage, there's no dog.

844
01:11:01,724 --> 01:11:03,192
I promise you that

845
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:08,822
Be careful with love.

846
01:11:09,999 --> 01:11:11,023
So what happened'?

847
01:11:14,837 --> 01:11:16,236
Thought I saw something

848
01:11:16,806 --> 01:11:19,070
Well, why don't we go to a movie?

849
01:11:38,394 --> 01:11:40,021
Piss off, go on!

850
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:52,108
Be careful with love.

851
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:54,504
What is it?

852
01:11:55,545 --> 01:11:57,377
It's a scarey movie.

853
01:12:00,249 --> 01:12:03,219
Did she scare you with her body?

854
01:12:21,571 --> 01:12:24,734
No love!

855
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:32,373
No love!

856
01:12:35,818 --> 01:12:37,308
No love!

857
01:12:39,622 --> 01:12:41,147
No love!

858
01:12:41,991 --> 01:12:43,982
Let's go.

859
01:12:46,262 --> 01:12:48,663
No love my friend.

860
01:13:00,610 --> 01:13:02,977
Do you know why I asked you over for dinner?

861
01:13:03,746 --> 01:13:05,475
Today's my birthday.

862
01:13:06,616 --> 01:13:08,015
I'm sorry but I don't have a present.

863
01:13:08,184 --> 01:13:10,653
But wait till next payday.

864
01:13:10,753 --> 01:13:12,517
Happy birthday

865
01:13:15,858 --> 01:13:17,417
Excuse me.

866
01:13:19,161 --> 01:13:20,959
Hello?
Happy birthday

867
01:13:21,130 --> 01:13:22,757
Thank you.
I'm sorry.

868
01:13:22,899 --> 01:13:26,096
I'm sorry Jack, I'm not alone.

869
01:13:35,211 --> 01:13:36,474
Be careful in love.

870
01:13:36,512 --> 01:13:38,310
No love.

871
01:13:38,848 --> 01:13:41,476
You mustn't fall in love with her.

872
01:13:46,322 --> 01:13:47,517
Now what?

873
01:13:48,691 --> 01:13:52,321
Nothing, just spilled my drink,
I'll just go clean up.

874
01:14:01,137 --> 01:14:03,868
Remember, you'll live to regret
it if you love her.

875
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,635
Come here.

876
01:14:06,375 --> 01:14:08,844
You made me human,
how come you won't let me love?

877
01:14:08,978 --> 01:14:10,503
You've only got 7 more days left.

878
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:12,274
Don't wreck it by falling in love.

879
01:14:12,348 --> 01:14:14,112
I want to stay human not a dog.

880
01:14:14,150 --> 01:14:16,244
But you can't change your destiny as a dog now.

881
01:14:16,352 --> 01:14:20,152
Listen, it's not the same thing,
a man is not a dog.

882
01:14:20,189 --> 01:14:22,590
I don't care about that,
I've got 7 days left to be a lover

883
01:14:22,658 --> 01:14:23,454
And I'm going to use them.

884
01:14:23,526 --> 01:14:25,016
But it isn't worth it.

885
01:14:25,094 --> 01:14:27,563
It won't work really, cause you aren't a man.

886
01:14:27,630 --> 01:14:29,689
You're only man's best friend.

887
01:14:30,399 --> 01:14:33,300
Kathy still loves Jack.

888
01:14:33,369 --> 01:14:37,499
And Jack loves her too.

889
01:14:37,573 --> 01:14:38,597
How you know it?

890
01:14:38,674 --> 01:14:41,302
I've watched their diaries

891
01:14:43,346 --> 01:14:45,576
They're perfect couple.

892
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:49,983
You'd be responsible for this <i>mess.</i>

893
01:14:50,086 --> 01:14:52,953
Let do a good job before you leave.

894
01:14:53,055 --> 01:14:57,515
Match them <i>as a</i> merit for yourself.

895
01:15:03,666 --> 01:15:08,467
Kathy we need to talk, I want to thank you.

896
01:15:08,537 --> 01:15:11,234
For making me happy, in my new life.

897
01:15:13,175 --> 01:15:14,609
I understand.

898
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:18,674
It must be very hard in Mainland China.

899
01:15:19,281 --> 01:15:20,544
I'm glad you came to HK.

900
01:15:20,916 --> 01:15:21,974
I want to say ...

901
01:15:22,184 --> 01:15:24,118
Jack loves you, you can't just leave him.

902
01:15:24,186 --> 01:15:25,197
Forgive him.

903
01:15:25,221 --> 01:15:26,655
What are you talking about?

904
01:15:26,722 --> 01:15:28,315
Lucy means nothing at all to him.

905
01:15:28,557 --> 01:15:30,047
I'm sure of that!

906
01:15:30,192 --> 01:15:30,954
How do you know'?

907
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:32,188
I saw it with my own eyes.

908
01:15:32,261 --> 01:15:33,695
Saw it with your own eyes'?

909
01:15:33,963 --> 01:15:36,022
I'm really your dog Magic.

910
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:39,994
I see, you've met someone new.

911
01:15:40,770 --> 01:15:43,762
Do you have a wife in China, is that it?

912
01:15:44,106 --> 01:15:46,666
If you don't want to be my friend.

913
01:15:46,742 --> 01:15:49,234
Just say so, you don't have to show up
with such excuses.

914
01:15:49,345 --> 01:15:50,676
I really am your dog Magic.

915
01:15:50,746 --> 01:15:52,908
I can prove it. I know so much about you.

916
01:15:52,982 --> 01:15:54,279
What do you know about?

917
01:15:54,316 --> 01:15:56,751
That earring you're wearing was a present
years ago from your mom.

918
01:15:56,786 --> 01:15:59,346
You mist aid it, I found it for
you there in the rubbish.

919
01:15:59,422 --> 01:16:02,824
And I know about that watch,
it's a present from Jack on Valentines Day.

920
01:16:02,925 --> 01:16:04,518
But...
You stop it.

921
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:08,391
You read my diary!

922
01:16:08,464 --> 01:16:10,398
Do you have no sense of privacy?

923
01:16:10,466 --> 01:16:11,433
I didn't do it.

924
01:16:12,001 --> 01:16:13,526
Get out!

925
01:16:16,439 --> 01:16:18,771
Open the door!

926
01:16:19,041 --> 01:16:20,600
I didn't read it, I swear to you.

927
01:16:20,709 --> 01:16:23,804
Hi hunky, you've been thrown out again?

928
01:16:34,857 --> 01:16:36,723
No wonder you call yourself a dog.

929
01:16:36,826 --> 01:16:40,160
The 2 of you make a perfect couple.

930
01:16:42,198 --> 01:16:43,256
You've ruined everything.

931
01:16:43,332 --> 01:16:44,731
In the end you'll thank me.

932
01:16:44,767 --> 01:16:46,166
It's better this way.

933
01:16:47,369 --> 01:16:50,395
Never mind, come to my place.

934
01:16:50,473 --> 01:16:52,407
Little cuddle, come on honey.

935
01:16:57,480 --> 01:17:00,006

<i>He's</i> all <i>sad.</i>

01:17:52,201 --> 01:17:54,260
All the need is a good walk, he'll be line.

942
01:17:54,336 --> 01:17:55,565
Are you puzzled by love?

943
01:17:55,638 --> 01:17:56,935
I've that experience.

944
01:17:57,072 --> 01:17:59,507
Be a man!

945
01:17:59,542 --> 01:18:01,442
Women are trouble.

946
01:18:01,944 --> 01:18:05,175
It's a broken heart.

947
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:10,383
Someone to see you, Mr Chiu.

948
01:18:10,486 --> 01:18:11,681
Thank you.

949
01:18:18,093 --> 01:18:20,221
It's the last day.

950
01:18:21,730 --> 01:18:24,722

01:18:24,767 --> 01:18:27,065

I know.

955
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:38,510
Kathy doesn't know what a lucky woman
she is to have a loyal dog like this.

956
01:18:38,681 --> 01:18:40,342
Hurry up Magic.

957

01:23:51,593 --> 01:23:54,028
You'd have taken him to the vet

1040

01:24:03,305 --> 01:24:04,830

Don't get upset

1054
01:24:54,656 --> 01:24:57,751
And the best love stories are riddled with tragedy

1055
01:24:57,960 --> 01:25:00,657

01:25:25,387 --> 01:25:27,014
Is it he son f0 Magic?

1066
01:25:27,556 --> 01:25:28,682
I'm scared he's ugly.

1067
01:25:28,790 --> 01:25:32,556
Don't make that face, you'll scare the puppy

1068
01:25:32,761 --> 01:25:35,594
Alright. I promise |'ll never scare him again

1069
01:25:36,898 --> 01:25:40,596
