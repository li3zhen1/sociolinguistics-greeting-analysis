00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:09,072
Feb. 12, 1912

1
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:11,076
second year of the Revolution.

2
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:14,136
An edict proclaimed

3
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:16,010
the abdication of Emperor Pu Yi.

4
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:20,008
And the end of the Manchu Dynasty.

5
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:22,179
A new China was in the offing.

6
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:27,057
Many, however failed to cope.

7
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:30,060
Eunuchs, for instance.

8
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:33,265
Grand their titles might be.

9
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,162
They were in fact royal slaves.

10
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,262
Castration is the eunuch's prerequisite.

11
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,998
That means the removal of male genitals.

12
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:45,067
The eunuchs down the centuries

13
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:49,138
called fondly the cut off part as Pet.

14
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:53,082
The Pet was boiled in oil and wrapped

15
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:57,021
put in a container and
suspended in midair

16
00:00:57,123 --> 00:01:00,991
The eunuchs invariably
came from poor families.

17
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,997
They were forced
onto this path of no return.

18
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:07,117
One, two, one, two...

19
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,127
Hurry up.

20
00:02:12,165 --> 00:02:15,225
Wait for me.

21
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,171
- Laishi.
- Yes.

22
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:23,005
Yes, Master Eunuch.

23
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,237
- Get me that flower.
- Yes.

24
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:33,144
Hurry up.

25
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,182
Hurry up, you stupid.

26
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:42,254
- Get him.
- Yes.

27
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:51,035
Tsouti.

28
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,043
Take it.

29
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:19,999
Young Teh Chang is here.

30
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,260
Laishi, come over here.

31
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,169
Who's that?

32
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,113
- It's Young Teh Chang
- Young Teh Chang?

33
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,225
Don't take those with bones.

34
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:58,159
Yummy, yummy.

35
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:01,102
Don't, these kids are so pitiful.

36
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,233
Don't dump it on the ground.

37
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:07,143
Lord Chang is right, they are pitiable.

38
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:10,148
Leave it in the barrel for them.

39
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,048
Let's go.

40
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,215
Go, go.

41
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:22,024
One more barrel there.

42
00:04:35,074 --> 00:04:36,132
Dad.

43
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,076
Bye.

44
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:42,137
The emperor is easier
to please than she is.

45
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,239
I want to have my thing snipped.

46
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,048
Nonsense.

47
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,082
I want to serve the emperor.

48
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,180
Then I'd have shoes to wear.

49
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:53,020
It's a chicken bottom.

50
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,226
Really? Let me have a sniff.

51
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,098
I'll split it in two.

52
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,262
No need, you have it all.

53
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,166
When can I have my thing snipped?

54
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,107
Ask your mother.

55
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:13,142
If she says yes, then it's alright.

56
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,047
Go, go.

57
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,117
Really?

58
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,247
Yes.

59
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,116
Really?

60
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,159
Yes.

61
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,138
Chiang Fu.

62
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,275
Good morning, sir.

63
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:54,014
I'm not here for the rent.

64
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,282
I'm here for a favour.

65
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,217
- Are you crazy?
- Don't hit me.

66
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,158
- You are out of your mind.
- I wouldn't dare anymore.

67
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:05,094
Get lost and don't come back.

68
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,275
You did him a favour, what about us?

69
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,169
But he said...

70
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,202
And you had to offer him all our food.

71
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,043
How do we carry on?

72
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,276
He said the emperor's in trouble.

73
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:28,282
We're in trouble too, and who cares?

74
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:33,252
I'm going, you go to your emperor.

75
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:37,188
The emperor protects us from foreigners.

76
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,131
And the revolutionaries.

77
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,096
Who'll take care of us
if the emperor's dead?

78
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,033
Great, great.

79
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,195
Come here.

80
00:06:49,108 --> 00:06:50,166
Go.

81
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:59,013
Don't go.

82
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,245
Who's going to cook for us?

83
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,180
Cooking with what?

84
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,052
I'm going to dig up some roots.

85
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,112
Dig up some roots?

86
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:06,180
Come here, Laishi.

87
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,124
What for?

88
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,156
Mesh roots again?

89
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:16,031
Aren't you tired of it yet?

90
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,266
Aren't you going?

91
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,078
I'm going to borrow some rice.

92
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:34,051
Great, rice for dinner.

93
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,214
Mum's here can't do it now.

94
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,054
No more chicken bottoms.

95
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,219
- What now?
- Send her away.

96
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,054
Don't you want some chicken bottoms?

97
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,223
Think of something.

98
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,225
Why are you throwing things at me?

99
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,171
How dare you.

100
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,135
You feel ashamed that I'm borrowing.

101
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:02,147
Send her away, dad.

102
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:03,182
I'm a man.

103
00:08:03,282 --> 00:08:07,048
I won't beg for food.

104
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,211
Get away.

105
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,095
Come with me.

106
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,065
Laishi.

107
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,233
I'm a man too.

108
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,099
Good.

109
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:33,269
Dad.

110
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,022
Dad, where are you going?

111
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:48,150
To find your mother.

112
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,094
Snip it off before you do that.

113
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,255
Sit down, dad.

114
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:55,233
Everything's alright after I snip it off.

115
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:58,168
Mum won't be mad at you again.

116
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:02,264
Dad, I'm a man, I'll be the first.

117
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,183
Take care of your sister.

118
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:22,022
District Chief.

119
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:23,218
What happened in town?

120
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,093
Good news, the emperor is out.

121
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,029
The revolutionaries won.

122
00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,191
Is that right?

123
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,263
Who'll be the new emperor?

124
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:35,007
Don't know.
But no more pig-tails for sure.

125
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,245
What's there, dad?

126
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,249
Wax, goose down, calcium powder, chili.

127
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,019
What for?

128
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:57,028
To stop bleeding, according to grandpa.

129
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,153
To snip off how much?

130
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,219
Whatever is there.

131
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,129
You'll be just like your sister.

132
00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,235
Have you got what I told you to get?

133
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,265
What's that?

134
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,072
For chopping off heads?

135
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,269
Death penalty for keeping a pig-tail?

136
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,980
Up to the Government.

137
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,207
So is it the death penalty or not?

138
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,182
No one mentioned anything yet.

139
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,252
It's bloody sharp.

140
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:30,154
Ready.

141
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,054
Yes.

142
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,260
I'm going to do it.

143
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,093
Come on.

144
00:10:40,106 --> 00:10:41,073
For real now.

145
00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:42,105
No, no way.

146
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,198
It's like castration.

147
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,210
- Who's going to be emperor?
- Don't know.

148
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,076
Come on.

149
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:22,079
Mum, mum.

150
00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:29,279
Mum, am I the first one?

151
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:35,253
It hurts, mum. I want to pee.

152
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:39,188
Don't move, it hasn't healed yet.

153
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,065
You must sleep for 100 days.

154
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:43,193
Good boy.

155
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:46,271
I want to pee.

156
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:08,015
Must change a new feather after peeling.

157
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,152
Must change everyday.

158
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:17,002
Or else you have to pee with your nose.

159
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,038
Good boy.

160
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,142
I have the answer.

161
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,210
Yes?

162
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:40,088
Must fry in oil, and wrap after dry.

163
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,023
I've borrowed some oil.

164
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,153
So go ahead.

165
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,197
I have to change the medicine.

166
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,993
Where's the thing?

167
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,000
In the bowl.

168
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,008
What are you waiting for?

169
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:04,277
I've forgot to get the recipe.

170
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,281
Never mind, use a large fire.

171
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,248
He has to keep it for lift.

172
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:14,082
Has to be well done.

173
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:27,004
It's late, go home please.

174
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:30,235
Go home, weather's getting cold.

175
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,068
Go now.

176
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,052
Don't catch cold.

177
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,091
Your son is the last eunuch
of Ching Dynasty.

178
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,060
Come out, Laishi, Master Eunuch.

179
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,060
Shut up you scum. Shut up.

180
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:56,033
Or you'll be cursed.

181
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:21,059
Where's the thing?

182
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,219
It's in the bag.

183
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:35,140
Keep it even into the coffin with you.

184
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:39,076
Or you won't be a man in the next life.

185
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:40,111
Yes.

186
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,271
Don't lose it.

187
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,181
I shall return in a sedan.

188
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,219
And there'll be a lot of chicken bottoms.

189
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,019
Good boy.

190
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,055
Go.

191
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,285
We are going.

192
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:03,099
Any Masters of my age, dad?

193
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,231
The emperor doesn't need eunuchs anymore.

194
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:09,997
The emperor will
win back his throne soon.

195
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,168
Then you'll be a eunuch.

196
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,074
When?

197
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:18,176
You must try to learn from the troupe.

198
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,180
Alright.

199
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,139
Stop.

200
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,107
Laishi.

201
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:49,008
You're supposed to be a drunken empress.

202
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:52,312
Not a prostitute on the loose.

203
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:57,113
An empress speaks elegantly.

204
00:15:57,156 --> 00:16:00,091
Sways like a willow when drunk.

205
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:02,023
Not clumsy like you.

206
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:05,154
Who wants an emperor like you?

207
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:08,062
Let me show you.

208
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,034
It was my favourite role.

209
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:14,129
I'd do it myself if I were slimmer.

210
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:17,107
Take this drunken scene.

211
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,144
Feel good.

212
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,151
What's that?

213
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,216
Smell so good.

214
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,090
Oh? A flower.

215
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:39,256
Let me put it in my hair.

216
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,227
Must be pretty.

217
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:46,227
I'll take a closer look.

218
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,202
Smell so good.

219
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:57,976
What kind of a flower?

220
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,216
- Got it.
- Yes.

221
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,282
Then come pick me up.

222
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:34,084
Good.

223
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,021
Have a bite, General.

224
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,250
Eat it yourself.

225
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:55,005
Good.

226
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,023
Bring him to me tomorrow.

227
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,118
Yes.

228
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,159
Master.

229
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,069
Boss.

230
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,230
Have a seat, master.

231
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,209
- Good response
- Really?

232
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,177
Not necessary for you.

233
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,076
Yes.

234
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,175
Anything for your folks.

235
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,239
Someone's going that way.

236
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,081
Yes, there is.

237
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,251
3, 4, 5, 6.

238
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:52,059
Are you on the run or what?

239
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:56,225
Will you ask the person to take these?

240
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,030
Alright.

241
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,039
At least get a new pair of shoes.

242
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,140
I like the old ones.

243
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:09,008
Go get a new pair tomorrow.

244
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,275
Thank you, master.

245
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,017
Take this to my folks please.

246
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,176
Go buy the shoes.

247
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:17,017
I buy a pair when I get paid.

248
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,249
The old ones are still good.

249
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,059
Never mind then.

250
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:24,254
Master, master.

251
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,052
What? Want it back?

252
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:29,999
No. Any news?

253
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,163
How long have you been with me?

254
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:34,194
9 years.

255
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,104
No, more like 10.

256
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,267
Aren't you well fed and well treated?

257
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:39,101
Haven't I taught you everything?

258
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,043
Yes, yes.

259
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,177
But it's chao outside.

260
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:48,209
The emperor is our true leader.

261
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,018
He needs to be served.

262
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,112
Don't I need to be served?

263
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,180
Of course.

264
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:55,055
But?

265
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,189
Please come over here.

266
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,031
I'm a eunuch, eunuchs stay in the Palace.

267
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:05,093
What's so special about being a eunuch?

268
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,159
You can work like anybody.

269
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,260
Right?

270
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,132
Why bother that monkey of a man?

271
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,271
But I'm castrated.

272
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:18,105
I can say I'm castrated too.

273
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,141
Can you prove I'm not?

274
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:24,021
I can say anything.

275
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,990
Like I have 3 belly buttons,
who can tell.

276
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:29,118
As long as you keep your clothes on.

277
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:31,025
Who can tell the difference?

278
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,258
No eunuchs have been hired
for a while now.

279
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,226
Unless the old ones are dying.

280
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,099
And need some money.

281
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:42,038
But then it costs 60 coins to fill in.

282
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,163
But...

283
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:47,110
Your future is here.

284
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,044
Stop being silly.

285
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:50,138
- Master
- Alright...

286
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:52,115
I know... Alright...

287
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,049
Master.

288
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,132
Where's the kid?

289
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,135
Let's go to the girls.

290
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:14,001
I don't have time, may be next time.

291
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,173
Hey, kid.

292
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:19,108
Only eunuchs are afraid to go in.

293
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,078
Let's check it out.

294
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,079
The rebel gets lost in the whore houses.

295
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:25,173
Get him, hurry.

296
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:33,081
Go in, go in.

297
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,991
Open up.

298
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,190
Open up.

299
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,243
Are you scared?

300
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:03,085
You won't be scared in a minute.

301
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,019
I have no money.

302
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:08,026
It's paid for.

303
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,087
- Come on.
- No.

304
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,969
Come out.

305
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,263
Damn.

306
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,110
You will see when I get you.

307
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,010
It's all quiet.

308
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:22,166
They are your friends?

309
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,070
Thank you.

310
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,178
How come you...

311
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,047
...you are in this business?

312
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,139
It would have been different.

313
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:41,082
If you had your way.

314
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,211
But...

315
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,222
Feel good.

316
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,095
Help! Soo, open up.

317
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:01,036
Stop running, you trash.

318
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:02,096
Open up, Sister Soo.

319
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:06,076
Help, open up.

320
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:08,076
Come out, you trash.

321
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:10,205
I'm not going to sleep with that fatso.

322
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,046
Give your mum a break.

323
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:14,244
He's here, and he has paid.

324
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,116
What am I going to do?

325
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,019
You asked him here, and he paid you.

326
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:21,025
You sleep with him.

327
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:22,024
I'll show you.

328
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,185
You trash.

329
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:24,160
What did you say?

330
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:25,194
- Don't come near.
- What did you say?

331
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:28,224
How much did that fatso pay?

332
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,235
This kid will fill in for him.

333
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:35,165
Don't kid me.

334
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,140
She's in no condition to work, look.

335
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:40,042
I'll fill in for her.

336
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,170
Not a penny less.

337
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:48,245
Take care of her, kid.

338
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,115
Tsouti.

339
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:22,015
Don't come near.

340
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,145
- Tsouti.
- Don't come closer.

341
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:28,184
It's me.

342
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:30,254
Laishi.

343
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:35,226
The one from your village.

344
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,169
It's you?

345
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,055
Are you Soo's regular client?

346
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:06,028
I slipped in among the rebels.

347
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:08,156
- So you are a rebel.
- No.

348
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:10,224
All rebels deny they are.

349
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:13,232
Soo said all rebels are womanizers.

350
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:14,266
I'm not.

351
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,008
They pushed me in.

352
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,236
I wouldn't even go to the public bath.

353
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,204
I'm afraid...

354
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:23,173
You think you're a girl.

355
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:33,081
I wish I were a boy and with a name.

356
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,155
But your name is Tsouti.

357
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,198
It only means

358
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,131
to bring on a brother.

359
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:46,100
A brother did come

360
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:47,195
and it became too crowded.

361
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,206
And my mum sold me to this place.

362
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:53,142
For five coins, cheaper than a pig.

363
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:58,273
Why didn't you tell me?

364
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:00,244
I wanted to.

365
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:02,218
But they told me you were hurt

366
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,016
and locked up.

367
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,113
The next day.

368
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,215
I was sold to this place.

369
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:11,222
Yes, where did it hurt?

370
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:15,232
I...

371
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,100
Never mind, you are well now.

372
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,170
Don't feel sorry for me.

373
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:26,040
I feel like a pig when I sleep with men.

374
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:28,136
It's their loss.

375
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,204
Don't I'll rescue you.

376
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,207
I'll work and take care of you.

377
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:37,146
It costs a lot to buy me out.

378
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,215
I'll discuss it with my master.

379
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:43,124
But you better.

380
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:44,161
Not stay here.

381
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,254
Don't you have to ask your wife?

382
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,293
I don't have one.

383
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:52,296
I don't have anything.

384
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:56,231
I know all rebels are courageous.

385
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,167
Hurry.

386
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:01,269
Hurry up, please.

387
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:03,275
Don't know, I'll tell you when there is.

388
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:05,014
Where's the master?

389
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:05,981
I said I didn't know.

390
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:07,109
When will he be back?

391
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,209
What a drag.

392
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,153
How's Soo, was she good last night?

393
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:11,245
They call her "One Stroke".

394
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:13,018
And how's the virgin?

395
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,080
- Tell us.
- Yes.

396
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:18,218
Please see if someone's looking for me.

397
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:21,164
Only you can go out and look.

398
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:23,132
Is he crippled, can't he come in himself?

399
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:25,099
Yeah.

400
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:28,230
She's a girl, she can't come in.

401
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:32,101
Oh! Smart kid.

402
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:35,203
Yu Lan, someone's looking for you.

403
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:37,275
Please wait.

404
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,243
Yu Lan, they're looking for you.

405
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:44,018
Are you Liu Yu Lan?

406
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,079
Yes.

407
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:47,216
Our boss isn't here.

408
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,021
Yes...

409
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,221
We are not here for your boss.

410
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,156
Get away.

411
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:58,128
General Lei sends for you.

412
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,000
Some other time, can't make it today.

413
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,175
General Lei is waiting.

414
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:10,147
I don't know him.

415
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,272
Thank him for me.

416
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:13,074
Yes, yes.

417
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,183
Let's go.

418
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,000
Tea, master.

419
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:35,035
At least you can delay them
till I come back.

420
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,038
They have guns.

421
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:40,010
So you were afraid. We have sabers.

422
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:42,012
Was it a plot or you were scared?

423
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,069
Can't even protect.

424
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:44,115
A member of your troop.

425
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:46,082
How can I depend on you in the future?

426
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,175
What are you doing here?

427
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:50,085
I'm looking for Laishi.

428
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:52,088
The show's over, nobody's around.

429
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,022
Laishi asked me to come.

430
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,184
Send her away.

431
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:58,218
Please take me to him.

432
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,264
He asked me to come.

433
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:02,226
Wait a minute.

434
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:06,169
What do you want him for?
I'm his teacher.

435
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,200
Are you running away?

436
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:14,211
Go back, it's alright.

437
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:17,112
Relax, I brought Laishi up with me.

438
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:19,207
He treats me like his father.

439
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:22,253
Is he here? He asked me to come.

440
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:26,121
He's in trouble.
The general took him away.

441
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:29,024
Has he been discovered?

442
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,185
You know everything.

443
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:35,291
I'm the only one who knows.

444
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:37,091
Poor kid.

445
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,228
He always keeps quiet.

446
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,170
Has to be extra careful going to toilets.

447
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,264
Or change, or go take a bath.

448
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,202
That gets him no friends.

449
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:49,007
That's why he denied it
when I made a guess.

450
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,071
You're only guessing?

451
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:53,174
Not really. I grew up with him.

452
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:57,187
And bumped into each other last night.

453
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:00,047
And found out that?

454
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:01,250
He denied it all along.

455
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,186
But call it a girl's intuition.

456
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,195
Why did he ask you here?

457
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:09,122
To live with him.

458
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,102
I've been thinking, he's a nice person.

459
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:15,071
I'll stay with him for life.

460
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,235
Are you sure
that's more than being friends.

461
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,272
It is for life...

462
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,171
I understand.

463
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:24,112
I'll cope with it.

464
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:26,116
I won't ask.

465
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:28,015
I'll keep his secrets.

466
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,986
It's a matter of compromising.

467
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:31,248
We'll be happy.

468
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,183
Luck little devil.

469
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,186
Is he in danger?

470
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:40,129
Not too serious. It might hurt a bit.

471
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,166
I wish I were here.

472
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,224
You are both...

473
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:46,167
Just Laishi, not me.

474
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:49,071
You all deny it.

475
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:50,131
So I am.

476
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:51,175
See, I am right.

477
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,233
Alright, alright.

478
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,222
Stop.

479
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:14,996
Don't move.

480
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,157
Are you crazy?

481
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:18,259
Be nice, they're Laishi's escorts.

482
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:19,264
We've got sabers.

483
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,096
So what? You stupid.

484
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:23,166
Sorry, they're hot-tempered.

485
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,139
We won't delay you any longer.

486
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:29,202
General Lei sends a message.

487
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,269
What's that?

488
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,038
He's going to marry Yu Lan.

489
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:35,051
Tomorrow.

490
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,121
This is the wedding token.

491
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:51,194
Go pack up.

492
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,100
And see me later.

493
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:55,102
Go.

494
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,066
Did the beast?

495
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:02,272
- No.
- Yours.

496
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,211
What if he sends for me tomorrow?

497
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:12,022
Tsouti's waiting for you inside.

498
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:13,249
Take her to your folks
first thing tomorrow.

499
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:16,118
General Lei won't be able to find you.

500
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:20,121
But what about you, master?

501
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:23,065
You want to live with Lei for life?

502
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:24,166
Go.

503
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:27,102
Tsouti is a good girl.

504
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,167
Don't act like a woman,
she won't like it.

505
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:32,174
Go.

506
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:34,210
Go ahead.

507
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,160
How's it?

508
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,063
Where does it hurt?

509
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:57,225
I...

510
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:02,196
- They burned you with fire.
- No.

511
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:04,002
- Burned you with cigarettes.
- No.

512
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,031
- Clamped your fingers.
- No.

513
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:06,235
- Hung you upside down.
- No.

514
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:09,143
I don't know what to tell you.

515
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:10,236
The truth of course.

516
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,073
Don't tell me.

517
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:14,050
You need violin music.

518
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,215
I...

519
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:20,018
What don't girls like?

520
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:21,149
Get it out.

521
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:26,292
I'm leaving, I want you to come with me.

522
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,224
Special mission.

523
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:32,133
No.

524
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:34,034
Military secret, can't you tell?

525
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,232
No.

526
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,210
I know you won't tell.

527
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,143
Never mind, go back to the old home.

528
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:45,079
Tsouti is so nice.
She'll keep the secret.

529
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:47,140
Tell me.

530
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:49,152
If he mistreats you.

531
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,217
Take care, master, we're going.

532
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:03,100
Laishi, you're forgotten your thing.

533
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:04,293
Thing?

534
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,129
Why didn't you mention this?

535
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:11,173
What is it?

536
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:13,107
That's his thing.

537
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:26,182
You're not a rebel.

538
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,155
I'm a eunuch.

539
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:40,196
I didn't mean to lie.

540
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:44,037
I'm a good man,
no fooling around, no gambling.

541
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:46,234
You'd said you didn't mind.

542
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:50,242
Go away, you two freaks.

543
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:52,073
I?

544
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:11,228
She changes her mind. Go alone.

545
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:17,207
I'm a eunuch.

546
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:20,244
I'll be treated as a freak.

547
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,082
Go to the Palace. You're safe there.

548
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,175
No one will treat you like a freak there.

549
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:31,016
But you told me not to go to the Palace.

550
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:32,248
I didn't say that.

551
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,054
Hold your head high

552
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:36,992
be a proud eunuch.

553
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:38,153
A eunuch has dignity too.

554
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:43,132
Just like being an actor.

555
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:50,231
My respect to you, sir.

556
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:51,263
Master.

557
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,203
Stand straight.

558
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,144
Be proud, be a man.

559
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,271
Yes.

560
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,242
Is that how a eunuch would say it?

561
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:00,276
Yes.

562
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:12,026
- Be good.
- Yes.

563
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,256
Go.

564
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,099
Yes.

565
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:30,044
Yesterday has left me irretrievably.

566
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,175
Today weighs me down with worries.

567
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:36,015
Send off those migratory birds.

568
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:40,114
And sleep off the day in style.

569
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,205
You are a rebel?

570
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:04,179
Where's the rebel?

571
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,183
So seraph the whore houses.

572
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:12,990
Someone is there.

573
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,140
That's him.

574
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:47,056
A fill in. Just a little gesture.

575
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:53,263
You have left something.

576
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,191
Go.

577
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,012
Ask him to come in.

578
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,141
Yes.

579
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,083
Go in. Kneel down.

580
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:26,092
Kneel down.

581
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,994
This is the one, Lord Ting.

582
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:32,228
Long live Lord Ting.

583
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,264
What's your name?

584
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,130
My name is Liu, they call me Laishi.

585
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,233
My opera master calls me Yu Lan.

586
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:41,201
Forgive me, My lord.

587
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:44,042
You now call yourself a servant.

588
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:46,049
You are no longer Laishi,
you are Chun Lu.

589
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,242
His lordship knows you are a fill-in.

590
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:51,247
But he doesn't like to know it from you.

591
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:55,225
What's your name?

592
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:56,259
Your servant...

593
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:58,187
Your name.

594
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:00,189
Chun Lu.

595
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:02,224
Chun Lu.

596
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,260
Have you checked his purity?

597
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:06,093
Yes.

598
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,172
Very clean, my lord.

599
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:23,049
Good, there is a lot to be learned.

600
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,281
All the rituals and procedures.

601
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:28,217
All are governed by rules.

602
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:32,059
Learn it from Lee, he'll teach you.

603
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:34,029
Don't let me down.

604
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:35,189
Yes.

605
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,965
Yes.

606
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,126
Yes.

607
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:41,103
I came in at 13.

608
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:46,269
Have witnessed everything.

609
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:49,104
The Dowager's sovereign.

610
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,081
The burning of the Yuan Ming Yuan.

611
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:56,085
The murder of Lady Jane.
The emperor's death.

612
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:58,121
Now the young emperor's wedding?

613
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:02,182
A long journey of life.

614
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:06,127
All under the grace of the late emperor.

615
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,222
I only wish you would
serve His Majesty well.

616
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,232
Yes.

617
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,997
I'll serve My lord with all my heart.

618
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:17,106
I'll do anything for His Majesty.

619
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:19,039
His Majesty is the true leader.

620
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:22,169
I'll be loyal to His Majesty.

621
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:24,144
To pay back his generosity.

622
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:27,014
Good.

623
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:28,244
Give him some silver coins.

624
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:30,110
Yes.

625
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:31,211
Yes.

626
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:33,046
I learned singing.

627
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:35,114
With your master.

628
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:39,094
Before I could sing
for the Dowager. She died.

629
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,154
I'll take care of you for your master.

630
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:43,097
Learn well.

631
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:49,197
Where's your thing?

632
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:52,007
Take it out.

633
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,190
What are they doing?

634
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:13,026
To put it in calcium powder.

635
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:15,998
It'll be returned to you when you leave.

636
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,066
Follow me.

637
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:39,088
The "thing" room?

638
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:42,282
Everyone's thing is here.

639
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,220
That's mine.

640
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:52,032
Long time no see, brother. What's up?

641
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,075
Lt'll catch the moisture down here.

642
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:01,043
That's where you start.

643
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:04,170
The most honored one up there.

644
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,272
One step at a time.

645
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:09,213
Work hard.

646
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,112
Yes, yes.

647
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,186
That's Lord Ting's.

648
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:24,159
Work harder.

649
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:50,056
Why go to Jade Spring Hill for water?

650
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:53,221
His Majesty likes the water there.

651
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:56,261
There's no other hands, just you and me.

652
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:59,161
It's tough,
but then it's for His Majesty.

653
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:01,136
It's not tough at all.

654
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:02,229
Why?

655
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:04,206
You'll see.

656
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:22,158
Wait for me, be right back.

657
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:31,158
Can I help?

658
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:33,169
No, wait here.

659
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:39,166
Please.

660
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:00,997
What else?

661
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:02,087
A clock.

662
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:03,121
Are those treasures from the Palace?

663
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,168
Your servant wouldn't know.

664
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:06,998
Has Lee given you money?

665
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:08,231
Yes, but your servant refused.

666
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:10,997
- Rise.
- Yes.

667
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:14,140
There's hope for the Ching Dynasty.

668
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:17,078
We can't let them go on.

669
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:18,081
Yes.

670
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:21,015
Your servant will
stop smuggling treasures.

671
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,245
No, you must go on.

672
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,247
You know who I'm going to see?

673
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:25,283
Your servant wouldn't know.

674
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:27,081
The master.

675
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:29,284
Don't tell anyone else.

676
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:33,053
You'll be witness. Catch them red-handed.

677
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:36,028
Yes, at your service.

678
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:39,195
Such refreshing words.

679
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:44,040
The Dowager was once
so pleased with my voice?

680
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:46,042
Unforgettable.

681
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:48,078
Like father like son.

682
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:49,203
One more time.

683
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:50,980
Yes.

684
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,173
Good.

685
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:54,176
Yes.

686
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:56,212
One more time.

687
00:45:57,054 --> 00:45:58,180
Yes.

688
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:04,025
Go.

689
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,062
Check the cart for smuggling.

690
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,188
Yes.

691
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:23,078
Anything?

692
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:24,205
No.

693
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,279
Nothing.

694
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,213
Call if off.

695
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,018
Let's go.

696
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:36,055
Wait.

697
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:39,221
The goods are here.

698
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,230
He's responsible.

699
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:46,035
Yes, it's him.

700
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:47,263
Yes, get him.

701
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:49,130
Yes.

702
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:51,207
He did it, I'm innocent.

703
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:53,175
I saw you only.

704
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:55,108
You're as good as dead.

705
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:57,043
Take him back, quick.

706
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,980
I'm innocent.

707
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:00,242
It's him, I'm innocent.

708
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:03,211
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

709
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:07,986
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

710
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:10,117
11, 12, 13.

711
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,993
14, 15, 16.

712
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:21,135
17, 18, 19, 20.

713
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:34,276
Buddy, can I have some water?

714
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:36,212
Can you feel thirst?

715
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:39,221
You're a dead man
but for the royal wedding.

716
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,082
Please, I'm so thirsty.

717
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:44,218
Alright, but call me sugar-daddy.

718
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:46,254
Sugar-daddy.

719
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:51,065
Your lordship.

720
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:53,227
Don't play jokes on me, please.

721
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:57,035
Your servant's at your mercy.

722
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:03,271
Your lordship.

723
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:08,041
Chun Fu, get me some plum juice.

724
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:09,278
Yes.

725
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:17,117
It is a conspiracy of the grandest scale.

726
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:18,183
Masters of 13 houses are all in it.

727
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:23,188
Tough luck for you.

728
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:26,202
Yes, "your servant" deserves it.

729
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:28,170
The historical treasures of Ching.

730
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,172
Being sold like junk.

731
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:33,209
His Majesty has been deceived.

732
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:35,245
If all this happened 10 years ago.

733
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:38,077
I would have them executed.

734
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:41,117
But this is not 10 years ago.

735
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:47,054
Chun Lu, when you are recovered.

736
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:50,285
I want you to report it to His Majesty.

737
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:53,152
Yes, your servant will do so.

738
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,027
Good.

739
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:58,101
I'll arrange it for you, I will.

740
00:48:58,168 --> 00:49:01,001
There's hope for the Ching Dynasty.

741
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,262
Your servant's at your mercy.

742
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:06,134
Not just you.

743
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:17,051
It was a good show.

744
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,087
For Her Highness's birthday.

745
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:20,020
That was "The 8 fairies' birthday gifts".

746
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:21,216
Just part of my duty.

747
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:25,058
To entertain the masters.

748
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:27,256
Oh, Lord Ting.

749
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:29,191
Is there anything I can do for you?

750
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:32,133
I have this budding plant.

751
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:35,194
Which I would like you
to see and comment of.

752
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:37,206
I am no expert.

753
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:39,139
You are so.

754
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:41,076
No, I am not.

755
00:49:41,278 --> 00:49:43,974
Keep an eye on it then, please.

756
00:49:44,047 --> 00:49:45,981
Very flattering.

757
00:50:12,075 --> 00:50:13,133
What are you doing?

758
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:14,199
Go get some work done.

759
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:16,142
Yes.

760
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:20,209
Come over here.

761
00:50:27,057 --> 00:50:29,082
Lord Ting, Lord Chao.

762
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:31,060
Your servant will be more disciplined.

763
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:34,154
That was a good "Drunken Empress".

764
00:50:34,231 --> 00:50:35,255
He is Chun Lu.

765
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:36,260
- Chun Lu.
- Yes.

766
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,001
Lord Chao wants to know

767
00:50:38,068 --> 00:50:39,194
your repertoire.

768
00:50:39,269 --> 00:50:42,102
Answer Lord Chao.

769
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:44,004
Mother and Son, "The Bridge".

770
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:45,041
The Robe.

771
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:47,042
Spring Chamber, "The Temple".

772
00:50:47,110 --> 00:50:48,008
Not bad.

773
00:50:48,078 --> 00:50:50,012
- That's quite impressive.
- Yes.

774
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:51,239
The young are getting better these days.

775
00:50:51,281 --> 00:50:53,112
Yes.

776
00:50:57,154 --> 00:51:00,055
How about it? Do you understand?

777
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:01,988
Not really.

778
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:04,254
What has it to do
with my rehearsal with Lord Chao?

779
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:06,154
A lot.

780
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:09,222
His Majesty watches
the opera each New Year.

781
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,264
Work hard.

782
00:51:13,070 --> 00:51:14,128
And get to play a role, and?

783
00:51:14,171 --> 00:51:15,229
Come, come.

784
00:51:18,208 --> 00:51:21,041
Sing your best,
when His Majesty is listening.

785
00:51:21,111 --> 00:51:22,169
Then never mind the accompaniment.

786
00:51:22,212 --> 00:51:24,180
Or the conducting of Lord Chao.

787
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:27,273
Recite this report to His Majesty.

788
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:29,116
Yes.

789
00:51:29,219 --> 00:51:30,277
I'll recede.

790
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:32,112
Even if it costs my life.

791
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:34,020
Not recede, it's recite.

792
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:35,149
Yes, recite it.

793
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:37,056
Good.

794
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:42,996
The people have been
suffering for too long.

795
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,067
The true emperor should make a come back.

796
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:49,095
And restore the country to its old glory.

797
00:51:49,172 --> 00:51:51,197
Good, say it after me.

798
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,263
Yes.

799
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:54,101
His Majesty dearest.

800
00:51:54,177 --> 00:51:57,044
The cloud hides the moon.

801
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,250
Haven't you heard of
the 4th May Movement?

802
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:03,246
His majesty is very fashionable.

803
00:52:04,020 --> 00:52:07,080
I've spent a whole month writing this.

804
00:52:08,058 --> 00:52:12,119
You must follow the trend.

805
00:52:12,195 --> 00:52:14,129
Or His Majesty won't like it.

806
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:15,289
Let us go on.

807
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:17,055
Yes.

808
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:21,263
His Majesty dearest.

809
00:52:22,005 --> 00:52:23,199
His Majesty dearest.

810
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:27,073
The cloud hides the moon.

811
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:31,205
The cloud hides the moon.

812
00:52:31,281 --> 00:52:36,082
The ugly wings of a crow.

813
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:39,088
Hide the blue sky.

814
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:42,284
The ugly wings of a crow

815
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:47,086
hide the blue sky.

816
00:52:49,199 --> 00:52:51,064
So terrifying.

817
00:52:51,134 --> 00:52:53,034
So terrifying.

818
00:52:53,103 --> 00:52:54,263
Terrible news.

819
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:56,136
Terrible news.

820
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:57,138
What is it?

821
00:52:57,207 --> 00:52:59,072
His Majesty is mad about the Palace fire.

822
00:52:59,142 --> 00:53:00,166
He has given us one hour

823
00:53:00,243 --> 00:53:01,232
to leave the Palace.

824
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:03,075
Or be executed.

825
00:53:03,146 --> 00:53:05,114
Impossible, I want to see His Majesty.

826
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,116
Don't just stand there, Chun Lu.

827
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:10,244
Go get your "thing".

828
00:53:44,187 --> 00:53:47,054
Thing.

829
00:53:52,028 --> 00:53:54,087
My thing.

830
00:53:55,131 --> 00:53:57,031
Chun Lu?

831
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:17,052
My thing.

832
00:54:25,195 --> 00:54:29,256
I don't want to go.

833
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:36,064
Where else can I go?

834
00:54:38,308 --> 00:54:41,175
I don't want to go.

835
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:43,007
Come, kick him out.

836
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:44,171
Go, Wong.

837
00:54:44,214 --> 00:54:45,272
Go.

838
00:54:46,049 --> 00:54:47,073
Wong.

839
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:53,056
Don't drag me, I'm not leaving.

840
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:37,190
Go, go.

841
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:39,235
Hurry.

842
00:55:50,146 --> 00:55:53,081
Sir, all the rebels are dead.

843
00:55:54,284 --> 00:55:56,184
- March homeward.
- Yes.

844
00:55:58,021 --> 00:55:59,010
March homeward.

845
00:56:14,237 --> 00:56:17,172
Collect the corpses first, go.

846
00:56:23,279 --> 00:56:25,144
Tsouti?

847
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:38,126
You looking for someone?

848
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:40,093
Caught another rebel.

849
00:56:40,196 --> 00:56:41,254
Another one.

850
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:47,134
Go, go.

851
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:54,236
I know your husband is a rebel.

852
00:57:11,294 --> 00:57:13,159
Big news, big news.

853
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:16,130
The last emperor
is kicked out of the Palace.

854
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:18,292
Big news, big news.

855
00:57:19,068 --> 00:57:23,004
The last emperor
is kicked out of the Palace.

856
00:57:26,075 --> 00:57:27,235
Let mum kiss you.

857
00:57:45,161 --> 00:57:46,219
So early.

858
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,992
I'm hungry.

859
00:57:49,065 --> 00:57:51,090
A good day today.

860
00:57:52,135 --> 00:57:54,069
Sold all the plum juice.

861
00:57:55,238 --> 00:57:57,138
I don't have any money.

862
00:57:57,207 --> 00:57:59,175
What do you need money for?

863
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:01,107
Well?

864
00:58:06,149 --> 00:58:08,117
To buy you something.

865
00:58:11,087 --> 00:58:12,987
I saved it up for you.

866
00:58:13,056 --> 00:58:16,219
To open up a shop in the future.

867
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:20,221
Future? When?

868
00:58:21,030 --> 00:58:22,190
It depends on how hard you'll work.

869
00:58:36,312 --> 00:58:40,112
Chinsheng, like the drum-stick?

870
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:42,049
What's up, granny?

871
00:58:42,118 --> 00:58:44,279
Granny? Are you blind?

872
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,080
I'm looking for Chun Lu. Chun Lu.

873
00:58:47,156 --> 00:58:49,056
No such person, no Chun Lu.

874
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:51,058
You know who Chun Lu is?

875
00:58:51,127 --> 00:58:52,219
- Good boy, Chinsheng.
- No.

876
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:53,251
Then how could you say no Chun Lu here?

877
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:55,122
I'm going in to look.

878
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,187
I said no such person, go away.

879
00:58:56,266 --> 00:58:58,131
No, I'm going in.

880
00:59:01,137 --> 00:59:03,002
Bless you, Lord Ting.

881
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:05,040
Such a voice, great.

882
00:59:05,108 --> 00:59:06,006
Rise.

883
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:07,167
Yes.

884
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:15,017
Where have you been, My lord?

885
00:59:15,084 --> 00:59:17,109
Out in the country.

886
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:19,120
I've been looking all over for you.

887
00:59:19,188 --> 00:59:21,019
Me too...

888
00:59:21,157 --> 00:59:22,283
Your servant has been doing so too.

889
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,289
You only care about yourself.

890
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,033
Still clear.

891
00:59:35,071 --> 00:59:37,130
I was wondering about the kid.

892
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:43,178
His Majesty is away from the Palace.

893
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:46,113
Living in the
Japanese Embassy, suffering.

894
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:50,017
It's time for us to make a move.

895
00:59:53,289 --> 00:59:56,087
Do you still remember?

896
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:57,217
What?

897
00:59:57,260 --> 01:00:00,161
That His majesty is your master.

898
01:00:00,229 --> 01:00:03,130
You have forsaken him for this woman.

899
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:05,227
Your servant is guilty.

900
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:07,196
I remember?

901
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:11,267
His majesty dearest, the cloud?

902
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:16,068
The cloud hides the moon.

903
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:19,138
Yes, the cloud hides the moon?

904
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:26,153
Chun Lu.

905
01:00:26,255 --> 01:00:28,155
Your servant is guilty.

906
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:31,083
Chun Lu.

907
01:00:31,160 --> 01:00:32,252
Tsouti.

908
01:00:33,229 --> 01:00:35,060
He's been my master for so many years.

909
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:37,066
I'm not your wife, more like a sister.

910
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:39,033
I have no right.

911
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:41,260
He's here only for old times sake.

912
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:44,230
Why the pig-tail then?

913
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:47,242
It's all my fault.

914
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:51,144
I have let you down,
Your Majesty Dowager.

915
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,272
I could only pray
when His Majesty was in trouble.

916
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:58,020
I'm so useless.

917
01:00:58,087 --> 01:00:59,179
Don't, My lord.

918
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:04,089
I can't even keep a loyal servant.

919
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,185
Lord Ting, Lord Ting.

920
01:01:05,261 --> 01:01:07,058
I'll die to pay for my guilty.

921
01:01:07,096 --> 01:01:08,222
Don't, please.

922
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:09,286
Let me die.

923
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:12,024
Don't stop me, let me die.

924
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:14,092
I'm useless, let me die.

925
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,229
Le me die.

926
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:19,105
Let me die.

927
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:21,040
Please don't be this way.

928
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,236
I want to die.

929
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:24,006
Stop that.

930
01:01:27,283 --> 01:01:29,217
Your servant's at your mercy.

931
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:34,990
Open up, Tsouti.

932
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:36,116
I'm not becoming a eunuch again.

933
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:42,289
Open up, Tsouti.

934
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:16,188
Forgive me, My lord.

935
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:20,224
I need no sympathy, I'd rather die.

936
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,162
Lord Ting.

937
01:02:23,272 --> 01:02:27,265
Without an emperor, there is no empire.

938
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,136
How can one be without a country?

939
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:34,047
Without the county there is no home.

940
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:37,119
What do you want me to do?

941
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:39,987
Can you give her up?

942
01:02:40,056 --> 01:02:43,184
If not, get out of my sight.

943
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:48,052
If yes, we'll see the emperor tomorrow.

944
01:03:12,221 --> 01:03:14,189
I'm not hungry, you go ahead.

945
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:19,060
Let the plums dry first before squashing.

946
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:23,258
Is it so important to see the emperor?

947
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:25,227
He's in trouble.

948
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:28,061
What can you two do?

949
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:33,299
He said the emperor needs our services.

950
01:03:34,177 --> 01:03:38,011
What about us?

951
01:03:38,114 --> 01:03:42,278
I have talked to our clients.

952
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:44,247
The noodle shops and the restaurants.

953
01:03:45,054 --> 01:03:48,182
Just deliver the plum juice to them.

954
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:51,283
Never mind the cart.

955
01:03:53,062 --> 01:03:55,053
And let the plums dry before squashing.

956
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:57,291
Let the plums dry before squashing.

957
01:03:58,034 --> 01:04:00,229
Use rock-sugar, not too much water.

958
01:04:01,037 --> 01:04:04,097
Enough. I want to hear no more.

959
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:10,045
Is the emperor more important than us?

960
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:14,071
Don't forget you are just a eunuch?

961
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:16,985
Yes, I am.

962
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:19,020
I am a eunuch.

963
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:27,086
When we are together
I can stand people laughing at me.

964
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:30,155
I'm used to it.

965
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:35,193
But it hurts when they laugh at you.

966
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:39,072
Chinsheng needs a father.

967
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:43,269
And His Majesty needs eunuchs.

968
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,247
That's why...

969
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:48,040
That's why you have to go.

970
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:51,244
Don't you want us
to live happily together.

971
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:54,285
Of course, but...

972
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:05,152
Your running dogs.

973
01:06:09,098 --> 01:06:12,033
These two want to see His Majesty.

974
01:06:14,236 --> 01:06:16,067
Please let us.

975
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:17,196
See His Majesty.

976
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:18,228
Where do you think.

977
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:20,275
You are?

978
01:06:28,217 --> 01:06:31,050
Send them away, such nonsense.

979
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:35,214
What did he say?

980
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,186
He said this was not a Palace,
no need for you.

981
01:06:41,263 --> 01:06:42,252
Told you to go away.

982
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,091
Nonsense.

983
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:47,033
His Majesty needs us.

984
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:49,094
Yes, let us see him.

985
01:06:49,205 --> 01:06:52,174
If he really doesn't need us, we'll go.

986
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:55,141
Go, times have changed.

987
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:56,269
We'll take care of the emperor.

988
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:58,138
Stand still.

989
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:59,269
What?

990
01:07:00,116 --> 01:07:01,083
Chun Lu.

991
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:02,048
Yes.

992
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:03,176
Check him out.

993
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:08,019
Chun Lu, go ahead.

994
01:07:08,224 --> 01:07:10,055
Yes.

995
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:20,032
What are you doing?

996
01:07:20,102 --> 01:07:21,126
This is Japanese property

997
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:23,035
no Chinese allowed.

998
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:25,130
Especially you, dummies.

999
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:30,978
Go away, dummies.

1000
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:37,084
My lord, not clean at all.

1001
01:07:37,286 --> 01:07:39,186
Send them away.

1002
01:07:41,123 --> 01:07:42,283
Nonsense.

1003
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:46,187
You have no right to serve His Majesty.

1004
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:47,286
Ridiculous.

1005
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:53,161
Let's go back now.

1006
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:56,136
No, I'm a master, I'll see the emperor.

1007
01:07:56,205 --> 01:07:57,194
My lord.

1008
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:10,115
My lord.

1009
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:33,197
I'd give up my thing
just to see His Majesty.

1010
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:36,244
My lord.

1011
01:08:39,148 --> 01:08:42,049
Our glorious Emperor.

1012
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,245
Let's go.

1013
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:49,248
My lord.

1014
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:56,190
Long live the Emperor.

1015
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:23,014
The cloud hides the moon.

1016
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:26,128
The ugly wings of a crow

1017
01:09:26,195 --> 01:09:31,030
cover the blue sky

1018
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:35,263
So terrifying.

1019
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:00,219
I'll bury the thing with you.

1020
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:05,290
So you can come back a complete man.

1021
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:11,162
A real eunuch needs a thing.

1022
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:14,041
I'm a eunuch no more.

1023
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:18,078
What comes off

1024
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:20,081
doesn't belong anymore.

1025
01:11:03,058 --> 01:11:04,252
You naughty thing.

1026
01:11:05,027 --> 01:11:05,254
Come home

1027
01:11:06,028 --> 01:11:08,189
or I'll lock you out.

1028
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:11,064
Don't cry.

1029
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,187
Tsouti.

1030
01:11:34,256 --> 01:11:37,157
I know I hurt you so much.

1031
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:42,996
I feel so regretful leaving you.

1032
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:44,191
And did such a ridiculous thing.

1033
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,259
I would have brought him home.

1034
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:51,205
But he's dead now.

1035
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:55,166
Will you forgive me?

1036
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:58,146
Are you still angry?

1037
01:11:58,247 --> 01:12:00,078
Tsouti.

1038
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:04,051
Maybe I'll go away.

1039
01:12:14,296 --> 01:12:17,060
Look at you, full of mud.

1040
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:20,101
Go wash your face first.

1041
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:24,165
Thank you.

1042
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:35,114
Tsouti...

1043
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:38,077
I want to...

1044
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:39,142
What do you want?

1045
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:41,155
I want to marry you.

1046
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:43,020
What did you say?

1047
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:46,119
I want to marry you.

1048
01:12:49,264 --> 01:12:51,164
Will you marry me?

1049
01:12:53,302 --> 01:12:56,999
Will you marry me? Answer me please.

1050
01:12:59,174 --> 01:13:01,074
Alright.

1051
01:13:01,143 --> 01:13:03,111
Stop squashing and it means yes.

1052
01:13:03,178 --> 01:13:07,274
Carrying on means no.

1053
01:13:21,296 --> 01:13:23,127
So the answer is no.

1054
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:25,063
I didn't say anything.

1055
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:27,295
But we need to deliver tomorrow.

1056
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:30,004
Say yes please.

1057
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:33,267
Yes.

1058
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,268
What are you doing?

1059
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,194
I have made up my mind.

1060
01:13:57,099 --> 01:14:00,091
Look at you, how can I say yes?

1061
01:14:04,306 --> 01:14:07,104
I'll cut it off.

1062
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,005
For you.

1063
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:10,066
I'll bring something back.

1064
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:13,047
We three are going to celebrate.

1065
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:17,047
Wait.

1066
01:14:23,258 --> 01:14:27,024
It's cold outside, Chinsheng's father.

1067
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:29,062
Chinsheng's father.

1068
01:14:30,265 --> 01:14:32,199
I'm Chinsheng's father?

1069
01:14:34,002 --> 01:14:35,196
Chinsheng's father...

1070
01:14:37,072 --> 01:14:39,097
I'm Chinsheng's father.

1071
01:14:58,126 --> 01:14:59,991
Why are you sitting there alone?

1072
01:15:00,128 --> 01:15:02,995
For Chinsheng, isn't it pretty?

1073
01:15:07,069 --> 01:15:08,229
Are you ill?

1074
01:15:10,072 --> 01:15:11,232
Someone's here.

1075
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:25,144
Laishi.

1076
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:33,185
How are you?

1077
01:15:34,162 --> 01:15:36,130
Make yourself at home.

1078
01:15:36,231 --> 01:15:40,065
You should have told me earlier.

1079
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:45,003
I'm sorry, I am...

1080
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:47,072
I am not a very good host.

1081
01:15:47,142 --> 01:15:48,234
We have not much to offer.

1082
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:50,210
Have a plum juice.

1083
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:52,247
Good stuff.

1084
01:16:00,255 --> 01:16:02,189
Have you told him about us?

1085
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:05,151
Yes.

1086
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:07,154
Why do you come now?

1087
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:11,188
I have never given up.

1088
01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:14,000
Tsouti.

1089
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:18,164
Tsouti.

1090
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:27,205
You are a rebel?

1091
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,115
Yes, I am.

1092
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:33,247
You said he was dead.

1093
01:16:35,223 --> 01:16:36,986
Laishi.

1094
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:39,124
The juice is spilled.

1095
01:16:39,194 --> 01:16:45,030
It can be filled again, but...

1096
01:16:46,068 --> 01:16:51,096
I shouldn't have come at this time.

1097
01:16:55,177 --> 01:16:58,146
Thank you for taking care of them.

1098
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:02,045
I'm too happy already.

1099
01:17:04,052 --> 01:17:06,043
To be able to see those two.

1100
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:16,093
Hanming.

1101
01:17:33,048 --> 01:17:34,140
Good boy, good boy.

1102
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:37,242
Good boy, good boy.

1103
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:54,192
Tsouti.

1104
01:17:58,173 --> 01:18:00,141
Don't cry.

1105
01:18:01,076 --> 01:18:02,202
Laishi.

1106
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:08,014
I've made up my mind.
I'll leave tomorrow.

1107
01:18:08,116 --> 01:18:11,108
Not just you, but you two.

1108
01:18:11,286 --> 01:18:13,220
She always talks about you.

1109
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:17,023
I know a lot.

1110
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:20,253
Chinsheng, he...

1111
01:18:21,129 --> 01:18:22,187
Take him with you...

1112
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:24,027
Yes.

1113
01:18:29,171 --> 01:18:32,197
Goodbye Mr Chen.

1114
01:18:32,307 --> 01:18:35,140
Hurry back.

1115
01:18:42,017 --> 01:18:43,985
Why isn't Laishi here to see us off?

1116
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:45,117
Could it be?

1117
01:18:45,187 --> 01:18:46,154
He said.

1118
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:49,190
He would come.

1119
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:53,091
He's so worried about us too.

1120
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:54,253
Alright then.

1121
01:19:13,148 --> 01:19:15,275
Get on.

1122
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:14,132
Get away.

1123
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:18,002
Wake up, you, wake up.

1124
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:19,137
Down with the Republic.

1125
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:22,275
Ching will be restored.

1126
01:20:23,218 --> 01:20:24,981
Wake up people.

1127
01:20:25,053 --> 01:20:26,077
Get away.

1128
01:20:26,154 --> 01:20:27,246
Long live the Emperor.

1129
01:20:28,023 --> 01:20:29,183
Thank you.

1130
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:32,184
Ching will be restored,
long live the Emperor.

1131
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:33,227
Crazy.

1132
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:35,092
I'm the emperor's eunuch.

1133
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:37,189
The emperor is arriving soon.

1134
01:20:37,265 --> 01:20:39,130
Hide yourselves. Want to be dead?

1135
01:20:45,106 --> 01:20:47,199
You low lives want to die.

1136
01:20:47,275 --> 01:20:50,039
You are the one who should be dead.

1137
01:20:50,078 --> 01:20:53,070
Eunuch? Where's your pig-tail?

1138
01:20:53,215 --> 01:20:55,080
Such a ridiculous thing to say.

1139
01:20:55,116 --> 01:20:57,050
Go now, or we'll have you executed.

1140
01:20:57,118 --> 01:20:58,176
I am a eunuch.

1141
01:20:58,286 --> 01:21:00,117
Alright.

1142
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:13,100
Search the coach.

1143
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:14,190
Follow me.

1144
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:16,100
Yes.

1145
01:21:22,277 --> 01:21:24,074
Stand still.

1146
01:21:25,013 --> 01:21:26,173
Hands up.

1147
01:21:31,152 --> 01:21:32,210
Go.

1148
01:21:33,255 --> 01:21:34,187
Don't move.

1149
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:36,052
Go.

1150
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:40,220
You, stand up.

1151
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:42,088
- Where are you from?
- Shantung.

1152
01:21:42,163 --> 01:21:43,187
- It's alright.
- Shantung?

1153
01:21:43,265 --> 01:21:44,254
Carrying a pistol?

1154
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,160
No, I dare not.

1155
01:21:47,135 --> 01:21:48,159
Sit down.

1156
01:21:56,111 --> 01:21:58,079
Are you crazy?

1157
01:21:58,146 --> 01:22:00,011
What's up?

1158
01:22:01,116 --> 01:22:02,174
Come with me.

1159
01:22:07,155 --> 01:22:09,180
Come, check it out.

1160
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:11,088
See if I'm really a eunuch?

1161
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:12,183
Who says I'm not?

1162
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:14,057
Even without a pig-tail.

1163
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:15,187
There's nothing down there, right?

1164
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:17,993
Come check it out.

1165
01:22:21,169 --> 01:22:23,160
Come, come, check it out.

1166
01:22:23,238 --> 01:22:25,001
Get him.

1167
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:37,243
Scum.

1168
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:41,017
Fraud.

1169
01:22:50,065 --> 01:22:51,999
How could that hurt,
there's nothing there.

1170
01:22:53,268 --> 01:22:54,292
Get up.

1171
01:22:55,236 --> 01:22:57,033
Get up and hit me.

1172
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:07,136
Trash.

1173
01:23:07,215 --> 01:23:09,274
Scum.

1174
01:23:17,125 --> 01:23:19,059
- Go.
- Yes.

1175
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:24,992
Night, jet black night.

1176
01:24:26,161 --> 01:24:33,033
Enveloping my solitude.

1177
01:24:35,036 --> 01:24:44,069
Chilling friendly feelings.

1178
01:24:44,179 --> 01:24:54,020
Making me shiver and shiver.

1179
01:24:54,289 --> 01:25:00,125
Life yields little mirth.

1180
01:25:01,229 --> 01:25:07,134
Good fortune's a random harvest.

1181
01:25:08,169 --> 01:25:12,037
What one wants is beyond reach.

1182
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:15,201
Fulfillment is not really happiness.

1183
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:22,205
Excuse me if I am wrong.

1184
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:29,250
Perhaps there's light
at the end of tunnel.

1185
01:25:30,024 --> 01:25:37,021
My thinking has changed.

1186
01:25:37,165 --> 01:25:44,230
It brings me face to face with reality.

1187
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:51,270
Excuse me if I am wrong.

1188
01:25:52,046 --> 01:25:58,246
Perhaps there's light
at the end of tunnel.

1189
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:05,255
My thinking has changed.

1190
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:13,091
It brings me face to face with reality.

1191
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:21,075
Excuse me if I am wrong.
