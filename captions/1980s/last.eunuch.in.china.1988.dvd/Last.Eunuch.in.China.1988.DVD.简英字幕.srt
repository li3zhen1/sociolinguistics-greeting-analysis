00:00:06,239 --> 00:00:09,072
一九一二年二月十二日
Feb. 12, 1912

2
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:11,076
武昌起义第二年

3
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:14,136
清廷隆裕皇太后终于被迫颁蚜虽咭

4
00:00:14,247 --> 00:00:16,010
退位诏书

00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:17,038
从此结束
And the end of

6
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:20,018
统治中国近三百年历史的清皇朝
the Manchu Dynasty.

7
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:22,179
为中国人带来了新希望
A new China was in the offing.

8
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:23,246
但是也有很多人
Many,

9
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:27,050
成为大时代变迁的牺牲品

10
00:00:27,227 --> 00:00:30,060
太监，就是其中一种人
Eunuchs, for instance.

11
00:00:30,296 --> 00:00:33,265
外表上太监的品级及职务繁复
Grand their titles might be.

12
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:37,162
实质也不外的皇族身边的奴隶
They were in fact royal slaves.

13
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,262
所有太监都要净身
Castration is the eunuch's prerequisite.

14
00:00:40,006 --> 00:00:42,998
就是把男性生殖器官阉割
That means the removal of male genitals.

15
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:45,067
按历代太监的惯例
The eunuchs down the centuries

16
00:00:45,145 --> 00:00:49,138
净身后阉割下来的器官称为宝贝
called fondly the cut off part as Pet.

17
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:53,082
首先用油炸透，再用油纸包妥
The Pet was boiled in oil and wrapped

18
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:57,021
放在秤量食的升内，吊在屋梁之上
put in a container and suspended in midair

19
00:00:57,123 --> 00:01:00,991
也只有贫苦家庭的子弟，为生活所迫
The eunuchs invariably came from poor families.

20
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:04,997
而踏上这条无法翩身的悲惨道路
They were forced onto this path of no return.

21
00:01:59,085 --> 00:02:07,117
一、二，一、二…
One, two, one, two...

22
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:12,127
快点，快点

27
00:02:26,045 --> 00:02:33,144
快点，快点
Hurry up.

28
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:39,182
真没用，快点拿过来
Hurry up, you stupid.

29

追他    是
- Get him. - Yes.

30
00:02:49,135 --> 00:02:51,035

拿着
Take it.

32
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:19,999
小德张回来了
Young Teh Chang is here.

33
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:22,260
来喜，过来，快点
Laishi, come over here.

34
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:32,169
是什么人呀？
Who's that?

00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:35,113
是小德张    小德张？
- It's Young Teh Chang - Young Teh Chang?

36
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,225
有骨的不要拿呀
Don't take those with bones.

37
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:58,159
好味道，好味道
Yummy, yummy.

38
00:03:58,304 --> 00:04:01,102
不要这样子，乡下的小孩真可怜
Don't, these kids are so pitiful.

39
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:03,233
不要丢在地上，折坠呀
Don't dump it on the ground.

40
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:07,143
是，是很可怜，张公公说得对
Lord Chang is right, they are pitiable.

41
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:10,148
放在桶里给他们吃吧
Leave it in the barrel for them.

42
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:12,048
我们走吧
Let's go.

43
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,215
走，走

44
00:04:20,159 --> 00:04:22,024
那里还有一桶呀
One more barrel there.

45

阿爹
Dad.

46
00:04:37,176 --> 00:04:39,076
再见
Bye.

47
00:04:39,145 --> 00:04:41,010
早知道割掉小祖宗去服侍皇帝
The emperor is easier

48
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,138
比服侍一个女人好
to please than she is.

49
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,239
我也割掉
I want to have my thing snipped.

50
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,048
割你的头
Nonsense.

51
00:04:46,319 --> 00:04:48,082
我割了去服侍皇帝
I want to serve

52
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,145
那就可以跟小德张一样
the emperor.

53
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,189
有鞋子穿，有轿子坐
Then I'd have shoes to wear.

54
00:04:50,256 --> 00:04:53,020
阿爹，有鸡尾巴吧呀
It's a chicken bottom.

55
00:04:58,031 --> 00:05:00,226
真是鸡尾巴呀，先嗅一下
Really? Let me have a sniff.

56
00:05:01,267 --> 00:05:03,098
我分两份
I'll split it in two.

57
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,262
不用了，我吃过了，你吃吧
No need, you have it all.

58
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,166
等一等，你什么时候替我割呀？
When can I have my thing snipped?

59
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,107
问你妈妈吧
Ask your mother.

60
00:05:11,277 --> 00:05:13,142
你妈妈答应的话，我就肯
If she says yes, then it's alright.

61
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,047
去吧，去吧
Go, go.

62
00:05:20,286 --> 00:05:22,117

真的？
Really?

65
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:28,159
是呀
Yes.

66
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,138
祥福
Chiang Fu.

67
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,275
三爷，这么早呀
Good morning, sir.

68
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:54,014
我今天来不是要你交田租
I'm not here for the rent.

69
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:56,282
不过有件事要你帮忙
I'm here for a favour.

70
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,217
你想死吗？    不要打我
- Are you crazy? - Don't hit me.

71
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,158
你饿到发昏了    我不敢了
- You are out of your mind. - I wouldn't dare anymore.

72
00:06:02,261 --> 00:06:05,094
你走吧，你走了就不要回来
Get lost and don't come back.

73
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:16,275
你说，你做好人，我们吃什么呀？
You did him a favour, what about us?

74
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,169
三爷说…
But

75
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,109
三爷说一句
he said...

76
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:20,236
你就把米缸的米全部给了他
And you had to offer him all our food.

77
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,043
我们怎能过年呀？你说
How do we carry on?

78
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:24,276
三爷说皇上有麻烦
He said the emperor's in trouble.

79
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:28,282
我们的困难有谁会理呢？你说吧
We're in trouble too, and who cares?

80
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:32,081
我回去妈妈那里
I'm going,

81
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:33,251
你叫皇帝请你吃龙肉吧
you go to your emperor.

82
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,027
皇帝没有饭吃
The emperor protects us from foreigners.

83
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,188
谁去打红毛鬼，谁去打山贼呀？
And the revolutionaries.

84
00:06:38,197 --> 00:06:40,131
谁去打革命党？
Who'll take care of us

85
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:42,096
饿死了皇帝，谁去理我们呀？
if the emperor's dead?

86
00:06:42,168 --> 00:06:44,033
好呀，好呀
Great, great.

87
00:06:44,137 --> 00:06:45,195
过来

来喜妈，不要走吧
Don't go.

90
00:06:59,085 --> 00:07:00,245
没有人烧饭给我吃，我会饿死的
Who's going to cook for us?

91
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,180
烧，用什么烧呀？
Cooking with what?

92
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,052
我去掘些菜头回来
I'm going to dig up some roots.

93
00:07:04,123 --> 00:07:05,112
掘菜头？
Dig up some roots?

来什么？
What for?

96
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,156
吃了半年菜根糊
Mesh roots again?

97
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:16,031
吃到每个人变为菜根了，你还要吃？
Aren't you tired of it yet?

98
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:22,266
你不走了？
Aren't you going?

99
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,078
我去借几两米糠，暂时顶住肚皮
I'm going to borrow some rice.

100
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:34,051
好了，我们有米糠吃了
Great, rice for dinner.

101
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,020
阿爹，不行了
Mum's here

102
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,248
妈妈在这里我岂不是不可以割
can't do it now.

103
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:40,054
岂不是没有鸡尾巴吃了
No more chicken bottoms.

104
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,219
那怎么办？    赶走妈妈吧
- What now? - Send her away.

105
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,054
阿爹，你不想吃鸡尾巴吗？
Don't you want some chicken bottoms?

106
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,223
你想办法吧
Think of something.

107
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:51,225
你为什么掷我？
Why are you throwing things at me?

108
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:54,171
阿爹，你真好胆
How dare you.

109
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:58,135
我去借量，你就觉得没面子
You feel ashamed that I'm borrowing.

110
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:02,147
阿爹，赶走妈妈，赶走妈妈吧

我去找你妈妈
To find your mother.

121
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,094
你帮我割掉后才找妈妈吧
Snip it off before you do that.

122
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,255
阿爹，你先坐下
Sit down, dad.

123
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:55,233
阿爹，我割掉后就不用再捱饿了
Everything's alright after I snip it off.

124
00:08:55,301 --> 00:08:58,168
妈妈就不会再骂你了

125
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:02,264
阿爹，我是个男子汉，要第一个割

126
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:19,183
照顾妹妹

127
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:22,022
地保，地保
District Chief.

128
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:23,218
城里发生什么事了？
What happened in town?

129
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,093
好消息，大清皇帝打败仗
Good news, the emperor is out.

130
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,029
现在革命党作主

00:09:27,099 --> 00:09:28,191
是吗？
Is that right?

132
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,263
又不知道谁做皇帝了
Who'll be the new emperor?

133
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:35,007
不知道，我只知道要把辫子剪掉
Don't know. But no more pig-tails for sure.

134
00:09:46,152 --> 00:09:48,245
阿爹，是什么呀？
What's there, dad?

135
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,249
白蜡、鹅毛、石灰炒、花椒粉
Wax, goose down, calcium powder, chili.

136
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,019
有什么用的？
What for?

137
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:57,028
以前听你的爷爷说，是用来止血的
To stop bleeding, according to grandpa.

138
00:09:57,129 --> 00:09:58,153
要割多少呀？
To snip off how much?

139
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,219
你有多少就割多少
Whatever is there.

140
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:01,129
将来跟你的妹妹一样
You'll be just like your sister.

00:10:02,301 --> 00:10:04,235
我叫你去找的东西呢？
Have you got what I told you to get?

142
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,265
这件怎么办？
What's that?

143
00:10:09,275 --> 00:10:11,072
斩头吗？
For chopping off heads?

144
00:10:11,143 --> 00:10:12,269
不剪辫会不会杀头呀？
Death penalty for keeping a pig-tail?

145
00:10:13,012 --> 00:10:14,980
执政的说杀就杀，不杀就不杀
Up to the Government.

146
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:16,207
那是杀还是不杀呀？
So is it the death penalty or not?

147
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,182
执政的没有吩咐嘛
No one mentioned anything yet.

148
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,252
好厉害呀
It's bloody sharp.

来了
Ready.

150
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,054
好

我割了
I'm going to do it.

我真的割了
For real now.

00:10:41,173 --> 00:10:42,105
不可以，不可以
No, no way.

155
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:43,198
剪了还是个人吗？
It's like castration.

156
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,210
有没有说谁是皇帝呀？    没有
- Who's going to be emperor? - Don't know.

157
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:48,076
来吧
Come on.

00:11:24,216 --> 00:11:29,279
妈妈，我是不是第一个割呀？
Mum, am I the first one?

160
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:35,253
妈妈，我很痛，我尿急呀
It hurts, mum. I want to pee.

161
00:11:36,128 --> 00:11:39,188
不要动，不要动，伤口还没痊愈
Don't move, it hasn't healed yet.

162
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,065
六婶说要睡足一百天才可以下床
You must sleep for 100 days.

163
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:43,193
乖
Good boy.

164
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:46,271
很急呀，我要屙尿
I want to pee.

165
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:08,015
不痛，不痛，屙完要换一条新鹅毛管
Must change a new feather after peeling.

166
00:12:08,127 --> 00:12:10,152
六婶说要天天更换的
Must change everyday.

167
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:12,997
乖，不留下个洞
Or else you have to

168
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:17,001
将来尿会从鼻孔出来的
pee with your nose.

169
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,038
乖
Good boy.

170
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:32,142
我问到了
I have the answer.

171
00:12:35,221 --> 00:12:36,210
问到了？
Yes?

172
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:40,088
要用油炸，九叔说炸完吹干用布扎实
Must fry in oil, and wrap after dry.

173
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,023
我借了四两油
I've borrowed some oil.

174
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,153
那你还不去炸？
So go ahead.

175
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,197
我还要替他换药
I have to change the medicine.

176
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,993
来喜割掉出来的宝贝呢？
Where's the thing?

177
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:49,000
在汤碗里
In the bowl.

178
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:02,008
还等什么？
What are you waiting for?

179
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:02,274
我忘了问九叔
I've forgot to

180
00:13:03,015 --> 00:13:04,243
要不要用姜葱先爆香镬子
get the recipe.

181
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:08,281
就这样子炸吧，记住要火大一点
Never mind, use a large fire.

182
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:10,248
孩子挂一辈子
He has to keep it for lift.

183
00:13:11,056 --> 00:13:14,082
炸得不够透会发霉的
Has to be well done.

184
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:27,004
很晚了，其实也没有什么好看的
It's late, go home please.

185
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:30,235
天气这么冷很容易着凉的，回家吧
Go home, weather's getting cold.

186
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:33,068
走吧，走吧
Go now.

187
00:13:41,187 --> 00:13:43,052
你小心着凉呀
Don't catch cold.

188
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:47,091
你的儿子做了清朝最后一个太监了
Your son is the last eunuch of Ching Dynasty.

189
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:50,060
来喜大总管，来喜大太监，出来吧
Come out, Laishi, Master Eunuch.

190
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,060
来你的仆街，再叫没好死
Shut up you scum. Shut up.

191
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:56,033
再叫生仔没屁股，再叫吊颈死
Or you'll be cursed.

192
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:21,059
宝贝呢？
Where's the thing?

193
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,219
带来了，在包袱里
It's in the bag.

194
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,225
九叔说
Keep it

195
00:14:30,269 --> 00:14:35,104
百年归老要将它放在你的棺材里
even into the coffin with you.

196
00:14:35,174 --> 00:14:38,007
不然将来投胎就不可以再做人了
Or you won't be a man in the next life.

197
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:39,066
记得吗？
Do you remember?

198
00:14:39,144 --> 00:14:40,111
记得了
Yes.

199
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,271
不可以失掉的
Don't lose it.

200
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:44,181
我将来要坐轿回来
I shall return in a sedan.

201
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:47,219
到时一定会请你们吃鸡尾巴的
And there'll be a lot of chicken bottoms.

202
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:51,019
乖
Good boy.

203
00:14:52,224 --> 00:14:54,055
走吧
Go.

204
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,285
我们走了
We are going.

205
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:00,994
阿爹，有没有像我年纪那么小
Any Masters of my age, dad?

206
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:03,091
就做大总管的？
The emperor

207
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:05,231
现在总统不准皇帝用太监了
doesn't need eunuchs anymore.

208
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:09,997
你放心，我想皇帝很快就会打赢总统
The emperor will win back his throne soon.

209
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:11,168
那你就可能做太监了
Then you'll be a eunuch.

210
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:13,074
那是什么时候？
When?

211
00:15:14,046 --> 00:15:17,038
你在城里二老爷的戏班先学一些东西
You must try to learn from

212
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,174
我想很快的
the troupe.

213
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,180
行了
Alright.

214
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:44,139
停
Stop.

215
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,107
来喜
Laishi.

216
00:15:46,312 --> 00:15:49,008
现在叫你扮杨贵妃喝醉酒
You're supposed to

217
00:15:49,081 --> 00:15:50,275
不是叫你扮胭脂胡同的醉鸡
be a drunken empress.

218
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:52,278
发花癫，四处走
Not a prostitute on the loose.

219
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:57,113
杨贵妃风情万种，说话莺声燕语
An empress speaks elegantly.

220
00:15:57,156 --> 00:16:00,091
喝醉酒时走起路也像摇风摆柳
Sways like a willow when drunk.

221
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:02,023
不像你这样子难看
Not clumsy like you.

222
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:03,083
唐明皇要是叫鸡
Who wants

223
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,153
也不喜欢你这个杨贵妃了
an emperor like you?

224
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:08,062
走开，我再做一次给你看
Let me show you.

225
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:11,034
贵妃醉酒就是你师父我当年拿手好戏
It was my favourite role.

226
00:16:11,103 --> 00:16:12,263
如果不是你师父突然间肥了
I'd do it myself

227
00:16:13,038 --> 00:16:14,164
也不会轮到你去做
if I were slimmer.

228
00:16:14,206 --> 00:16:17,107
就好像她喝醉了出花园的一段
Take this drunken scene.

229
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,144
真舒服
Feel good.

230
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:29,151
是什么呢？
What's that?

231
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:31,216
真芳香
Smell so good.

232
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:35,090
原来是一朵花
Oh? A flower.

233
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,287
我要摘了它下来，拿在手里
Let me put it

234
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:39,258
插在头上
in my hair.

235
00:16:40,032 --> 00:16:42,227
一定会很漂亮的
Must be pretty.

236
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:46,227
让我走近看清楚
I'll take a closer look.

237
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:54,202
真芳香
Smell so good.

238
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:57,976
看看这朵是什么花？
What kind of a flower?

239
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:06,216
你们看见没有？    看见了
- Got it. - Yes.

240
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,282
还不扶我起来？
Then come pick me up.

241
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:34,084
好
Good.

242
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:38,021
先吃点东西吧，大帅
Have a bite, General.

243
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:39,250
自己吃自己吧
Eat it yourself.

244
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:55,005
好
Good.

245
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,023
明天散戏后带他回来见我
Bring him to me tomorrow.

246
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:18,118
是
Yes.

247
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,159
师父
Master.

248
00:18:25,137 --> 00:18:26,069
二老板
Boss.

249
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,230
师父，坐吧
Have a seat, master.

250
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:31,209
今天的观众反应不错    是吗？
- Good response - Really?

251
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:34,177
不过不要先开心，不一定是赞你的
Not necessary for you.

252
00:18:34,279 --> 00:18:36,076
知道了
Yes.

253
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:38,175
有人回静海去
Anything for your folks.

254
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:39,239
有没有东西带返乡下呀？
Someone's going that way.

255
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:41,081
有呀，有呀
Yes, there is.

256
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,251
三、四、五、六
3, 4, 5, 6.

257
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,090
我只教你上台唱戏
Are you on the run or what?

258
00:18:50,162 --> 00:18:52,062
我有教你走难的吗？
Will you ask the person to take these?

259
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:56,225
师父，麻烦你帮我托人送返乡下吧

260
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,030
可以
Alright.

261
00:18:58,070 --> 00:19:01,039
不买新衣服的话也得买双新鞋子
At least get a new pair of shoes.

262
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,140
不是呀，旧鞋很舒服的
I like the old ones.

263
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:09,008
明天到天桥那里去买双鞋子吧
Go get a new pair tomorrow.

264
00:19:09,081 --> 00:19:10,275
谢谢师父
Thank you, master.

265
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:13,017
师父，替我带返乡下吧
Take this to my folks please.

266
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,176
叫你去买就买好了
Go buy the shoes.

267
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:17,017
不用了，下个月出量才买吧
I buy a pair when I get paid.

268
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,249
鞋子还可以穿
The old ones are still good.

269
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:22,059
不买就省掉
Never mind then.

270
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:24,254
师父，师父
Master, master.

271
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:26,052
什么？想拿回？
What? Want it back?

272
00:19:26,131 --> 00:19:29,999
不是，那件事怎么样？
No. Any news?

273
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:33,163
你跟了我多少年？
How long have you been with me?

274
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:34,194
九年
9 years.

275
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:36,104
不，十年了
No, more like 10.

276
00:19:36,141 --> 00:19:37,267
现在没有饭你吃，没有衣服你穿
Aren't you well fed and well treated?

277
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:39,101
没教足你的功夫吗？
Haven't I taught you everything?

278
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:41,043
不是，不是
Yes, yes.

279
00:19:42,014 --> 00:19:45,177
不过现在外面很混乱，没有人负责
But it's chao outside.

280
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:48,209
宣统皇帝才是真命天子
The emperor is our true leader.

281
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:51,018
他需要人来服侍
He needs to be served.

282
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:52,112
师父不要人服侍吗？
Don't I need to be served?

283
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,180
要，要
Of course.

284
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:55,055
不过…
But?

285
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,189
师父，你先过来这边，来吧
Please come over here.

286
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:04,031
我是公公，公公就要入宫
I'm a eunuch, eunuchs stay in the Palace.

287
00:20:04,069 --> 00:20:05,093
公公不用吃饭和大小便吗？
What's so special about being a eunuch?

288
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,159
你现在没有手没有脚
You can work like anybody.

289
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:07,260
不能抬又不能挑吗？
Right?

290
00:20:08,006 --> 00:20:09,132
是要服侍那马骝干嘛
Why bother that monkey of a man?

291
00:20:13,212 --> 00:20:15,271
但是我割了
But I'm castrated.

292
00:20:16,114 --> 00:20:18,105
我也可以说我割了小祖宗
I can say I'm castrated too.

293
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:20,141
你怎么知道我是不是呀，你说吧
Can you prove I'm not?

294
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:24,021
我屁股生疮，我屁股有两个洞
I can say anything.

295
00:20:24,089 --> 00:20:26,990
有三个肚脐，谁知道呀？
Like I have 3 belly buttons, who can tell.

296
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:28,083
除了不可以生孩子外
As long as you keep your clothes on.

297
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,149
你又不脱裤子给人看
Who can tell the difference?

298
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:31,025
跟普通人有什么分别呀？
No eunuchs have been hired

299
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:33,258
不请太监很久了
for a while now.

300
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:36,226
除非有些太监老了、病了，就快断气
Unless the old ones are dying.

301
00:20:36,268 --> 00:20:38,099
想赚取一笔棺材本
And need some money.

302
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:42,038
顶名费都要六十个钱，你有吗？
But then it costs 60 coins to fill in.

303
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:43,163
我…
But...

304
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:45,073
用心唱戏吧

305
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:47,111
你唱得好的话就有美好的前途了
Your future is here.

306
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:49,044
不要太多心了
Stop being silly.

307
00:20:49,114 --> 00:20:50,138
师父    是了…
- Master - Alright...

308
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:52,115
我知道了…行了…
I know... Alright...

309
00:20:52,184 --> 00:20:54,049
师父
Master.

310
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,132
师弟，去那里呀？
Where's the kid?

311
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:11,135
师弟，跟我们去喝花酒吧
Let's go to the girls.

312
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:14,001
师兄，我没有空，改天吧
I don't have time, may be next time.

313
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,173
师弟…
Hey, kid.

314
00:21:16,241 --> 00:21:19,108
公公才不进入妓寨的，你是公公吗？
Only eunuchs are afraid to go in.

315
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:21,078
先检查一下
Let's check it out.

316
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,079
那个乱党走进了胭脂胡同，追他
The rebel gets lost in the whore houses.

317
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:25,173
追他，快点
Get him, hurry.

318
00:21:26,084 --> 00:21:33,081
进去…
Go in, go in.

319
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,991
开门呀
Open up.

320
00:21:38,030 --> 00:21:39,190
开门呀
Open up.

321
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,243
你很害怕？
Are you scared?

322
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:03,085
告诉你，等一会儿什么你也不会害怕
You won't be scared in a minute.

323
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:05,019
我没有钱的
I have no money.

324
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:08,026
已经付钱了
It's paid for.

325
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,087
来吧    不要
- Come on. - No.

326
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,969
你快点出来
Come out.

327
00:22:19,137 --> 00:22:20,263
该死的
Damn.

328
00:22:25,210 --> 00:22:27,110
捉到你就知道厉害
You will see when I get you.

329
00:23:08,019 --> 00:23:10,010
没有声音的？
It's all quiet.

330
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:22,166
他们是你的朋友？
They are your friends?

331
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,070
谢谢
Thank you.

332
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,178
你为什么会做…
How come you...

333
00:23:35,180 --> 00:23:38,047
做，做这种东西呢？
...you are in this business?

334
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,139
当初你有办法
It would have been different.

335
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:41,082
今日就不用被人家玩弄了
If you had your way.

336
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,211
我…
But...

337
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,222
真舒服
Feel good.

338
00:23:57,002 --> 00:23:59,095
救命呀，苏姐，开门呀
Help! Soo, open up.

339
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:01,036
臭丫头，你还走？
Stop running, you trash.

340
00:24:01,072 --> 00:24:02,096
开门呀，苏姐
Open up, Sister Soo.

341
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:06,076
开门呀，救命呀
Help, open up.

342
00:24:06,211 --> 00:24:08,076
臭丫头，你快点出来，出来
Come out, you trash.

343
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:10,205
我不跟那个胖子睡，我宁死也不愿意
I'm not going to sleep with that fatso.

344
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,046
你不要害阿妈
Give your mum a break.

345
00:24:13,084 --> 00:24:14,244
人家来了，钱又收了
He's here, and he has paid.

346
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,116
你现在叫我怎么办？
What am I going to do?

347
00:24:16,188 --> 00:24:18,019
人是你叫来的，钱也是你收的
You asked him here, and he paid you.

348
00:24:18,056 --> 00:24:21,025
要睡的话你跟他睡，我宁死也不愿意
You sleep with him.

349
00:24:21,092 --> 00:24:22,024
你看看
I'll show you.

350
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,185
我今天一定要打死这个死丫头
You trash.

351
00:24:23,228 --> 00:24:24,160
你说什么？
What did you say?

352
00:24:24,262 --> 00:24:25,194
你不要过来    你说什么
- Don't come near. - What did you say?

353
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:28,224
那个肥佬给了多少钱开苞呀？
How much did that fatso pay?

354
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:31,235
这个小兄弟要顶了她
This kid will fill in for him.

355
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:35,165
苏姐，你不要跟我开玩笑
Don't kid me.

356
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:37,140
你看她的样子怎能见人呀
She's in no condition to work, look.

357
00:24:37,209 --> 00:24:40,042
不如这样吧，我帮S顶了她
I'll fill in for her.

358
00:24:40,111 --> 00:24:42,170
一毛钱也不少给你的
Not a penny less.

359
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:48,245
小弟弟，替我好好的照顾她
Take care of her, kid.

360
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:20,115
招弟？
Tsouti.

361
00:25:20,218 --> 00:25:22,015
你不要过来
Don't come near.

362
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,145
招弟    不要过来
- Tsouti. - Don't come closer.

363
00:25:27,092 --> 00:25:28,184
是我呀
It's me.

364
00:25:29,094 --> 00:25:30,254
来喜呀
Laishi.

365
00:25:31,096 --> 00:25:35,226
静海东柳木村那个来喜呀
The one from your village.

366
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:39,169
是你？
It's you?

367
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,055
你常常来找苏姐的？
Are you Soo's regular client?

368
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:04,060
不是，刚才外面捉革命党

369
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:06,029
我进来躲避一下
I slipped in among the rebels.

370
00:26:06,097 --> 00:26:08,156
你是革命党    不是
- So you are a rebel. - No.

371
00:26:08,199 --> 00:26:10,224
苏姐说革命党不会认自己是革命党的
All rebels deny they are.

372
00:26:11,002 --> 00:26:13,232
苏姐又说革命党很风流的
Soo said all rebels are womanizers.

373
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:14,266
我不风流的
I'm not.

374
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,008
刚才是他们付钱捉我进来的
They pushed me in.

375
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,236
我连外面的浴室也不敢去
I wouldn't even go to the public bath.

376
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,204
我怕…
I'm afraid...

377
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:23,173
你以为你是女孩子吗？
You think you're a girl.

378
00:26:29,054 --> 00:26:31,079
如果我是男孩子就好了
I wish I were a boy

379
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:33,056
我连名字也没有
and with a name.

380
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,155
你不是叫招弟的吗？
But your name is Tsouti.

381
00:26:39,230 --> 00:26:41,198
招弟即是带一个弟弟来的意思
It only means

382
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,131
不是名字
to bring on a brother.

383
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:46,100
结果妈妈真的生了一个弟弟
A brother did come

384
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:47,195
说不够吃
and it became too crowded.

385
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,206
跟着把我卖到这里来
And my mum sold me to this place.

386
00:26:49,274 --> 00:26:53,142
只得五个钱，比猪还要便宜
For five coins, cheaper than a pig.

387
00:26:56,214 --> 00:26:58,273
为什么你走也不告诉我？
Why didn't you tell me?

388
00:26:59,084 --> 00:27:00,244
你以为我不想找你吗？
I wanted to.

389
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:02,218
人家说你不知道割伤了那里
But they told me you were hurt

390
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,016
被妈妈困住了
and locked up.

391
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,113
你伤了的第二天
The next day.

392
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,215
我就被人捉到这里来了
I was sold to this place.

393
00:27:09,027 --> 00:27:11,222
是呀，你割伤那里呀？
Yes, where did it hurt?

394
00:27:13,264 --> 00:27:15,232
我…
I...

395
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:19,100
算了，你现在已经痊愈
Never mind, you are well now.

396
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:21,170
你不用替我难过
Don't feel sorry for me.

397
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:26,040
我当自己是只死猪，陪男人上床睡觉
I feel like a pig when I sleep with men.

398
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:28,136
是那些男人吃亏
It's their loss.

399
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:30,204
不要吧，我救你
Don't I'll rescue you.

400
00:27:31,216 --> 00:27:33,207
我赚钱，我养你
I'll work and take care of you.

401
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:37,146
赎身要很多钱的
It costs a lot to buy me out.

402
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,215
我跟师父商量一下
I'll discuss it with my master.

403
00:27:40,291 --> 00:27:43,124
不过这样子，这里那么危险
But you better.

404
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:44,161
你还是不要留在这里？
Not stay here.

405
00:27:44,229 --> 00:27:46,254
你不用去问你老婆吗？
Don't you have to ask your wife?

406
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,293
我没有
I don't have one.

407
00:27:51,136 --> 00:27:52,296
我什么也没有
I don't have anything.

408
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:56,231
我知道革命党是不会见死不救的
I know all rebels are courageous.

409
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,167
你走快两步，精乖一点
Hurry.

410
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:01,269
请你们快一点
Hurry up, please.

411
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:03,275
不知道，有的话我会告诉你
Don't know, I'll tell you when there is.

412
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:05,014
师兄，师父呢？
Where's the master?

413
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:05,981
我早说过不知道
I said I didn't know.

414
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:07,109
师兄，师父什么时候回来呀？
When will he be back?

415
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,209
真讨厌
What a drag.

416
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,153
师兄，你昨晚怎样搞掂苏姐的？
How's Soo, was she good last night?

417
00:28:10,221 --> 00:28:11,245
她的外号叫一招了
They call her "One Stroke".

418
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:13,018
你怎样子跟那个处女开苞的？
And how's the virgin?

419
00:28:13,091 --> 00:28:14,080
告诉我们    是
- Tell us. - Yes.

420
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:17,092
大师兄，麻烦你帮我去后门
Please see

421
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,219
看看有没有人找我
if someone's looking for me.

422
00:28:18,263 --> 00:28:21,164
在这个时候，只有你才可以出去
Only you can go out and look.

423
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:23,132
他跛的吗？他自己不会进来吗？
Is he crippled, can't he come in himself?

424
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:25,099
是呀
Yeah.

425
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:28,230
她是个女孩子，这里怎可以进来呀？
She's a girl, she can't come in.

426
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:32,101
你好呀
Oh! Smart kid.

427
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:35,203
玉兰，有人找你
Yu Lan, someone's looking for you.

428
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:37,275
你们等一等
Please wait.

429
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,243
玉兰，他们说要找你
Yu Lan, they're looking for you.

430
00:28:42,187 --> 00:28:44,018
你是不是刘玉兰？
Are you Liu Yu Lan?

431
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:45,079
是呀
Yes.

432
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:47,216
这位官大哥，我们的二老板不在？
Our boss isn't here.

433
00:28:47,292 --> 00:28:49,021
是呀…
Yes...

434
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,221
不关你们二老板的事，也不关你的事
We are not here for your boss.

435
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:53,156
走开
Get away.

436
00:28:54,032 --> 00:28:58,128
我们的雷大帅想请你喝酒
General Lei sends for you.

437
00:28:58,203 --> 00:29:00,000
我今天没有空，改天吧
Some other time, can't make it today.

438
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:05,175
雷大帅在等你
General Lei is waiting.

439
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:10,147
我不认识他，麻烦你告诉他
I don't know him.

440
00:29:10,248 --> 00:29:11,272
说我多谢了
Thank him for me.

441
00:29:12,016 --> 00:29:13,074
是…
Yes, yes.

442
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,183
走
Let's go.

443
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:32,000
师父，喝茶
Tea, master.

444
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:33,204
你们算什么？
At least you can delay them

445
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,034
为什么不延迟到我回来？
till I come back.

446
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:36,038
他们有枪的
They have guns.

447
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:40,010
怕什么？他们有枪，我们没有刀呀
So you were afraid. We have sabers.

448
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:42,012
你们有意整蛊还是没胆子呀？
Was it a plot or you were scared?

449
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,069
在自己的地盘
Can't even protect.

450
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:44,115
自己的师兄弟也保不住了
A member of your troop.

451
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:46,082
怎能落班？怎能跑马头呀？
How can I depend on you in the future?

452
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:47,175
你鬼鬼祟祟的在干什么呀？
What are you doing here?

453
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:50,085
来喜在不在？你能不能带我去见他？
I'm looking for Laishi.

454
00:29:50,188 --> 00:29:52,088
戏散了，所有的人都走光了
The show's over, nobody's around.

455
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,022
刘来喜，是他叫我来找他的
Laishi asked me to come.

456
00:29:54,092 --> 00:29:55,184
别噜嗦了，叫她走吧
Send her away.

457
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:58,218
你让我看看他吧
Please take me to him.

458
00:29:58,296 --> 00:30:00,264
谢谢你们，是他叫我来这里找他的
He asked me to come.

459
00:30:01,032 --> 00:30:02,226
等一等…
Wait a minute.

460
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:06,169
你找来喜有什么事？我是他的师父
What do you want him for? I'm his teacher.

461
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:10,200
你是逃出来的吗？
Are you running away?

462
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:14,211
没事了，进去吧
Go back, it's alright.

463
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:17,112
你放心吧，来喜八岁就开始跟着我
Relax, I brought Laishi up with me.

464
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:19,207
我当是他爸爸一样
He treats me like his father.

465
00:30:19,284 --> 00:30:22,253
来喜在不在？他叫我来找他的
Is he here? He asked me to come.

466
00:30:23,288 --> 00:30:26,121
他出了事，被大帅带走了
He's in trouble. The general took him away.

467
00:30:26,191 --> 00:30:29,024
是不是他的身份被人识破了？
Has he been discovered?

468
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:31,185
你知道他的身份？
You know everything.

469
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:34,256
在这里除了我一个人之外
I'm the only one

470
00:30:34,999 --> 00:30:35,260
没有其他人知道
who knows.

471
00:30:36,067 --> 00:30:37,091
其实他很凄凉
Poor kid.

472
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:38,067
平时连说一句话
He always keeps quiet.

473
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:39,228
也害怕人家识破他的身份
Has to be extra careful going to toilets.

474
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:41,170
甚至去厕所，大小便
Or change, or go take a bath.

475
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:43,264
脱衣服、洗澡，都特别小心
That gets him no friends.

476
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:45,202
所以弄到一个朋友也没有
That's why he denied it

477
00:30:45,276 --> 00:30:49,007
难怪我猜中了他也不承认
when I made a guess.

478
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,071
原来你是靠猜的
You're only guessing?

479
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:53,174
那又不是，我跟他从小玩到大
Not really. I grew up with him.

480
00:30:53,251 --> 00:30:57,187
后来失去联络，昨晚才遇上
And bumped into each other last night.

481
00:30:58,056 --> 00:31:00,047
发觉他原来是…
And found out that?

482
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:01,250
虽然我怎样去问他，他也不肯承认
He denied it all along.

483
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,186
但是女孩子很敏感的
But call it a girl's intuition.

484
00:31:03,261 --> 00:31:05,195
他叫你来干什么？
Why did he ask you here?

485
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:09,122
他叫我跟他一起生活
To live with him.

486
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,102
我考虑过了，他是一个好人
I've been thinking, he's a nice person.

487
00:31:13,171 --> 00:31:15,071
我决定一辈子跟着他
I'll stay with him for life.

488
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,235
你想清楚呀，做夫妻不同做朋友
Are you sure that's more than being friends.

489
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,272
有很多事情夫妻一世流…
It is for life...

490
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,171
算了，我明白的
I understand.

491
00:31:22,247 --> 00:31:24,112
有些事情我就当看不见
I'll cope with it.

492
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:26,116
他不肯说我就不问
I won't ask.

493
00:31:26,184 --> 00:31:28,015
我可以替他保守秘密
I'll keep his secrets.

494
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:29,986
大家你迁就我，我迁就你
It's a matter of compromising.

495
00:31:30,088 --> 00:31:31,248
一样会很开心的
We'll be happy.

496
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:34,183
来喜这只马骝仔真有福气
Luck little devil.

497
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,186
来喜是不是很危险呀？
Is he in danger?

498
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:40,129
恐怕不会死的，但是屁股可能会开花
Not too serious. It might hurt a bit.

499
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:42,166
刚才我在这里就好了
I wish I were here.

500
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:44,224
原来你和来喜都是…
You are both...

501
00:31:44,302 --> 00:31:46,167
来喜是，我不是
Just Laishi, not me.

502
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:49,071
不是等于是，你们都不会承认的
You all deny it.

503
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:50,131
那我是了
So I am.

504
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:51,175
我已说过你们是的
See, I am right.

505
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,233
对…
Alright, alright.

506
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,222
停手
Stop.

507
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:14,996
别动
Don't move.

508
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,157
你们这些兔崽子想作反呀？
Are you crazy?

509
00:32:16,234 --> 00:32:18,259
人家送来喜回来，就该客气一点
Be nice, they're Laishi's escorts.

510
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:19,264
我们有刀呀
We've got sabers.

511
00:32:20,038 --> 00:32:21,096
刀？你妈的
So what? You stupid.

512
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:23,166
对不起，他们近来火气上升
Sorry, they're hot-tempered.

513
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,139
如果没事的话，不阻碍你们了
We won't delay you any longer.

514
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:29,202
二老板，雷大帅要我来通知你一声
General Lei sends a message.

515
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,269
什么呀？
What's that?

516
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,038
大帅很喜欢玉兰
He's going to marry Yu Lan.

517
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:35,051
明天会有大红花桥来接她过门
Tomorrow.

518
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,121
下聘礼
This is the wedding token.

519
00:32:50,034 --> 00:32:51,194
你们回旅馆收拾东西
Go pack up.

520
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:53,100
然后来戏院找我
And see me later.

521
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:55,102
去吧
Go.

522
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,066
那禽兽有没有…
Did the beast?

523
00:33:00,111 --> 00:33:02,272
没有    你的
- No. - Yours.

524
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,211
如果他明天抬花桥来的话，怎么办？
What if he sends for me tomorrow?

525
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:12,022
招弟在里面等着你
Tsouti's waiting for you inside.

526
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:13,249
明天早上城门一开，你就带她返乡下
Take her to your folks first thing tomorrow.

527
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:16,118
雷大帅就找不到你了
General Lei won't be able to find you.

528
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:20,121
师父，我这样子走了，会连累你的
But what about you, master?

529
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:23,065
难道你想跟雷大帅过着一辈子吗？
You want to live with Lei for life?

530
00:33:23,234 --> 00:33:24,166
快点去吧
Go.

531
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:27,102
很难才找到像招弟逆来顺受的女孩子
Tsouti is a good girl.

532
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,167
不要婆婆妈妈了，女孩子不喜欢的
Don't act like a woman, she won't like it.

533
00:33:30,274 --> 00:33:32,174
走吧
Go.

534
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:34,210
来吧
Go ahead.

535
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:51,160
怎么样呀？
How's it?

536
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:56,063
你那里开花呀？
Where does it hurt?

537
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:57,225
我…
I...

538
00:34:01,172 --> 00:34:02,196
他们用火烧你？    不是
- They burned you with fire. - No.

539
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:04,002
用香烟烫你？    不是
- Burned you with cigarettes. - No.

540
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,031
夹你的手指？    不是
- Clamped your fingers. - No.

541
00:34:05,109 --> 00:34:06,235
将你倒吊？    不是
- Hung you upside down. - No.

542
00:34:07,278 --> 00:34:09,143
我不知道该怎样对你说
I don't know what to tell you.

543
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:10,236
当然是直接说
The truth of course.

544
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,073
难道还要音乐过场
Don't tell me.

545
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:14,050
让你慢慢唱出来吗？
You need violin music.

546
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,215
我…
I...

547
00:34:18,289 --> 00:34:20,018
女人不喜欢什么呀？
What don't girls like?

548
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:21,149
快点说
Get it out.

549
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:26,292
我要去另一处地方，你跟我一起走吧
I'm leaving, I want you to come with me.

550
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:30,224
是不是特别任务？
Special mission.

551
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:32,133
不是
No.

552
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:34,034
军事秘密，不可以说出来的？
Military secret, can't you tell?

553
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,232
也不是
No.

554
00:34:38,242 --> 00:34:40,210
我看你们怎样也不会说出来的
I know you won't tell.

555
00:34:40,278 --> 00:34:42,143
你别胡思乱想了，返乡下耕田吧
Never mind, go back to the old home.

556
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:45,079
招弟很好的，她又可以替你守秘密
Tsouti is so nice. She'll keep the secret.

557
00:34:45,149 --> 00:34:47,140
如果他欺负你，你告诉我
Tell me.

558
00:34:47,218 --> 00:34:49,152
让我教训他
If he mistreats you.

559
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,217
师父，我们要走了，你要好好保重
Take care, master, we're going.

560
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:03,100
来喜，你忘了那个宝贝了
Laishi, you're forgotten your thing.

561
00:35:03,167 --> 00:35:04,293
宝贝？
Thing?

562
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:08,129
有宝贝也不告诉我
Why didn't you mention this?

563
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:11,173
是什么？
What is it?

564
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:13,107
是他的小祖宗
That's his thing.

565
00:35:25,022 --> 00:35:26,182
你不是革命党？
You're not a rebel.

566
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,155
我是公公
I'm a eunuch.

567
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:40,196
我不是想骗你的
I didn't mean to lie.

568
00:35:40,271 --> 00:35:44,037
我是个乖儿子，又不风流，又不赌钱
I'm a good man, no fooling around, no gambling.

569
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:46,234
你又说不计较的
You'd said you didn't mind.

570
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:50,242
走开，你们两只怪物
Go away, you two freaks.

571
00:35:51,015 --> 00:35:52,073
我？
I?

572
00:36:08,065 --> 00:36:11,228
她不走，你自己走吧
She changes her mind. Go alone.

573
00:36:15,273 --> 00:36:17,207
我是公公
I'm a eunuch.

574
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:20,244
我到那里人家也把我当怪物看待
I'll be treated as a freak.

575
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:26,082
你入宫吧，军阀不能进紫禁城拉人的
Go to the Palace. You're safe there.

576
00:36:26,150 --> 00:36:28,175
在那里，就没有人把你当怪物看待
No one will treat you like a freak there.

577
00:36:28,252 --> 00:36:31,016
但是你说过不要做太监的
But you told me not to go to the Palace.

578
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:32,248
没有，我没有说过
I didn't say that.

579
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,054
只要你挺着胸膛做人
Hold your head high

580
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:36,992
做一个硬桥硬马的太监
be a proud eunuch.

581
00:36:37,061 --> 00:36:38,153
太监也是人
A eunuch has dignity too.

582
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:41,130
唱戏是骗饭吃，做太监也是骗饭吃

583
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,099
没有分别的
Just like being an actor.

584
00:36:49,173 --> 00:36:50,231
跟公公请安
My respect to you, sir.

585
00:36:50,274 --> 00:36:51,263
师父
Master.

586
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,203
站着，做个堂堂正正
Stand straight.

587
00:36:53,244 --> 00:36:55,144
有骨气、有男子气慨的太监
Be proud, be a man.

588
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,271
是
Yes.

589
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,242
太监是这样说话的吗？
Is that how a eunuch would say it?

590
00:36:59,116 --> 00:37:00,276
是
Yes.

591
00:37:09,193 --> 00:37:12,026
用心干吧    是
- Be good. - Yes.

592
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:14,256
走吧
Go.

593
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,099
是
Yes.

594
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:30,044
弃我去者，昨日之日不可留
Yesterday has left me irretrievably.

595
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:33,175
乱我心者，今日之日多烦优
Today weighs me down with worries.

596
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:36,015
长风万里送秋雁
Send off those migratory birds.

597
00:37:36,053 --> 00:37:40,114
对此可以酣高楼
And sleep off the day in style.

598
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,205
你是革命党？
You are a rebel?

599
00:38:03,247 --> 00:38:04,179
那个乱党走了那里去？
Where's the rebel?

600
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:07,183
再到胭脂胡同里搜
So seraph the whore houses.

601
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:12,990
好像有人呀
Someone is there.

602
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:41,140
就是这个了
That's him.

603
00:38:45,122 --> 00:38:47,056
顶包来的，小小意思
A fill in. Just a little gesture.

604
00:38:51,295 --> 00:38:53,263
李爷，你漏掉了东西
You have left something.

605
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,191
走吧
Go.

606
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:12,012
叫他进来吧
Ask him to come in.

607
00:39:12,083 --> 00:39:13,141
是
Yes.

608
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:22,083
进去吧，跪呀
Go in. Kneel down.

609
00:39:24,261 --> 00:39:26,092
跪呀
Kneel down.

610
00:39:27,264 --> 00:39:29,994
启禀丁公公，就是这个
This is the one, Lord Ting.

611
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:32,228
谢谢丁公公收留，丁公公福寿无疆
Long live Lord Ting.

612
00:39:33,104 --> 00:39:34,264
叫什么名字呀？
What's your name?

613
00:39:35,139 --> 00:39:37,130
小人姓刘，乡下的人叫我来喜
My name is Liu, they call me Laishi.

614
00:39:37,208 --> 00:39:39,233
戏班师父叫我玉兰
My opera master calls me Yu Lan.

615
00:39:40,177 --> 00:39:41,201
奴才该死
Forgive me, My lord.

616
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:44,042
你不是小人，你是奴才
You now call yourself a servant.

617
00:39:44,115 --> 00:39:46,049
你不是来喜，你是春禄
You are no longer Laishi, you are Chun Lu.

618
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,242
公公知道你是冒充
His lordship knows you are a fill-in.

619
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:51,247
但是不喜欢亲口听你说，明白吗？
But he doesn't like to know it from you.

620
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:55,225
你究竟叫什么名字？
What's your name?

621
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:56,259
奴才…
Your servant...

622
00:39:57,027 --> 00:39:58,187
奴才？
Your name.

623
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:00,189
春禄
Chun Lu.

624
00:40:01,098 --> 00:40:02,224
春禄
Chun Lu.

625
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,260
验明正身没有？
Have you checked his purity?

626
00:40:05,035 --> 00:40:06,093
是
Yes.

627
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,172
回公公，非常干净
Very clean, my lord.

628
00:40:19,283 --> 00:40:23,049
好，春禄，宫中有很多礼法
Good, there is a lot to be learned.

629
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:25,281
譬如叩头请安、倒茶递水
All the rituals and procedures.

630
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:28,217
传话、回话，都有一定的规矩
All are governed by rules.

631
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:32,059
你多点向李爷学习，以后跟着李爷
Learn it from Lee, he'll teach you.

632
00:40:32,129 --> 00:40:34,029
不要丢我的脸呀
Don't let me down.

633
00:40:34,131 --> 00:40:35,189
是
Yes.

634
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,965
喳
Yes.

635
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:39,126
喳
Yes.

636
00:40:39,203 --> 00:40:41,103
老夫十三岁入宫
I came in at 13.

637
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:46,269
亲眼看见先帝登基大婚，变法维新
Have witnessed everything.

638
00:40:47,011 --> 00:40:49,104
老佛爷两度垂帘听政
The Dowager's sovereign.

639
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:52,081
红毛鬼一把火烧毁圆明园
The burning of the Yuan Ming Yuan.

640
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:56,085
珍贵人跳井自尽，先帝驾崩
The murder of Lady Jane. The emperor's death.

641
00:40:56,187 --> 00:40:58,121
到现在皇上说要大婚
Now the young emperor's wedding?

642
00:40:58,189 --> 00:41:01,090
由一条开档裤到现在同皇后主子
A long journey of life.

643
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:02,216
同一个灶吃饭

644
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:06,127
都是先帝所赐，老夫无以为报
All under the grace of the late emperor.

645
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:09,222
只希望你们勤勤力力侍奉皇上
I only wish you would serve His Majesty well.

646
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,232
是
Yes.

647
00:41:10,267 --> 00:41:12,997
奴才一定尽心服侍丁公公
I'll serve My lord with all my heart.

648
00:41:13,170 --> 00:41:16,037
他日有机会服侍万岁爷
I'll do anything for His Majesty.

649
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:17,130
一定赴汤蹈火

650
00:41:17,174 --> 00:41:19,039
皇上才是真命天子
His Majesty is the true leader.

651
00:41:19,109 --> 00:41:21,043
我有机会一定效忠皇上
I'll be loyal to His Majesty.

652
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,203
报答皇上、服侍皇上
To pay back his generosity.

653
00:41:22,279 --> 00:41:24,144
谢谢皇上恩典
Good.

654
00:41:24,181 --> 00:41:27,014
好，小李，传话管事房
Give him some silver coins.

655
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:28,244
赐春禄白银二两

656
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:30,110
是
Yes.

657
00:41:30,187 --> 00:41:31,211
是
Yes.

658
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:33,046
以前老佛爷喜欢听戏
I learned singing.

659
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:35,114
我特意请你师父教我唱几句
With your master.

660
00:41:35,192 --> 00:41:39,094
想不到一开腔老佛爷就死了
Before I could sing for the Dowager. She died.

661
00:41:39,163 --> 00:41:41,154
你师父关照到我，我一定会照顾你我
I'll take care of you for your master.

662
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:43,097
要用心学呀
Learn well.

663
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:49,197
宝贝呢？
Where's your thing?

664
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:52,007
拿出来吧
Take it out.

665
00:42:06,290 --> 00:42:08,190
李爷，他干什么？
What are they doing?

666
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:13,026
他们现在用石灰粉替你把宝贝腌了
To put it in calcium powder.

667
00:42:13,097 --> 00:42:15,998
到你以后离开时候，就把宝贝还给你
It'll be returned to you when you leave.

668
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,066
跟我来
Follow me.

669
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:39,088
宝贝房？
The "thing" room?

670
00:42:39,256 --> 00:42:41,190
是呀，我们每个人的宝贝
Everyone's thing is here.

671
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:42,283
都是放在这里的
That's mine.

672
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:44,220
那个就是我的

673
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:52,032
兄弟，很久没见，别来无恙吗？
Long time no see, brother. What's up?

674
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:59,075
放这么低，地气重，很容易会发霉
Lt'll catch the moisture down here.

675
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:01,043
你新来的
That's where you start.

676
00:43:01,178 --> 00:43:04,170
以前李莲英那个就放在那里
The most honored one up there.

677
00:43:04,248 --> 00:43:05,272
所以要勤力一点
One step at a time.

678
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:09,213
步步高升，就不会生虫了
Work hard.

679
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:11,112
是呀，是呀
Yes, yes.

680
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:18,186
这个是丁公公的
That's Lord Ting's.

681
00:43:22,032 --> 00:43:24,159
用多点心思去学习吧
Work harder.

682
00:43:48,225 --> 00:43:50,056
李爷，为什么要到玉泉山取水呀？
Why go to Jade Spring Hill for water?

683
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:53,221
皇上喜欢喝玉泉山的水没有苦涩味
His Majesty likes the water there.

684
00:43:54,031 --> 00:43:56,261
又请不起苏拉，只有你和我去做
There's no other hands, just you and me.

685
00:43:57,034 --> 00:43:59,161
给皇上喝，辛苦一点也是应该的
It's tough, but then it's for His Majesty.

686
00:43:59,236 --> 00:44:01,136
不辛苦，是优差呀
It's not tough at all.

687
00:44:01,205 --> 00:44:02,229
为什么？
Why?

688
00:44:02,272 --> 00:44:04,206
取水嘛
You'll see.

689
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:22,158
春禄，你等我一会，我很快就回来
Wait for me, be right back.

690
00:44:29,099 --> 00:44:31,158
李爷，用不用帮忙？
Can I help?

691
00:44:31,235 --> 00:44:33,169
不用，在这里等我吧
No, wait here.

692
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:39,166
请
Please.

693
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:00,997
还有什么？
What else?

694
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:02,087
还有个钟
A clock.

695
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:03,121
究竟是不是宫中珍品？
Are those treasures from the Palace?

696
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,168
奴才该死，奴才不知宫中有什么珍品
Your servant wouldn't know.

697
00:45:05,235 --> 00:45:06,998
李胖子有没有赏赐给你？
Has Lee given you money?

698
00:45:07,071 --> 00:45:08,231
有，不过奴才没有要
Yes, but your servant refused.

699
00:45:09,006 --> 00:45:10,997
起来    是
- Rise. - Yes.

700
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:14,140
大清有救了
There's hope for the Ching Dynasty.

701
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:17,078
春禄，我们不可以纵容这班败类
We can't let them go on.

702
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:18,081
是
Yes.

703
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:21,015
奴才从明天开始，不再替李爷送赃物
Your servant will stop smuggling treasures.

704
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:22,245
不可以，一定要送
No, you must go on.

705
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:24,247
你知不知道我准备找谁人呀？
You know who I'm going to see?

706
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:25,283
奴才不知道
Your servant wouldn't know.

707
00:45:26,023 --> 00:45:27,081
你不要告诉别人
The master.

708
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:29,284
我找大总管商量商量
Don't tell anyone else.

709
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:33,053
到时你要做证人，我要人赃并获
You'll be witness. Catch them red-handed.

710
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:36,028
是，奴才一定会守秘密
Yes, at your service.

711
00:45:37,034 --> 00:45:39,195
我很久没有听到人叫得这么正义凛然
Such refreshing words.

712
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:44,040
老佛爷有次游园赏花，赞我叫得响亮
The Dowager was once so pleased with my voice?

713
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:46,042
我毕生难忘
Unforgettable.

714
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:48,078
真是虎父无犬子
Like father like son.

715
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:49,203
再叫呀
One more time.

716
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:50,980
是
Yes.

717
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,173

是

719
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:56,212
再多叫一次

是
Yes.

721
00:46:03,127 --> 00:46:04,025
走吧
Go.

722
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:06,062
有人偷运宝物，立刻搜查水车
Check the cart for smuggling.

723
00:46:06,130 --> 00:46:07,188
是
Yes.

724
00:46:22,146 --> 00:46:23,078
有没有发现？
Anything?

725
00:46:23,147 --> 00:46:24,205
没有
No.

726
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:30,279
报告，没有发现
Nothing.

727
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:32,213
收队
Call if off.

728
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,018
你们走吧
Let's go.

729
00:46:34,224 --> 00:46:36,055
等一等…
Wait.

730
00:46:38,095 --> 00:46:39,221
宝物在这里呀
The goods are here.

731
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:41,230
是他偷出去卖的
He's responsible.

732
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:46,035
是，是他
Yes, it's him.

733
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:47,263
不错，是他，捉住他
Yes, get him.

734
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:49,130
是
Yes.

735
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:51,207
宝物是他偷的，不关我的事
He did it, I'm innocent.

736
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:53,175
我只是看见你一个人
I saw you only.

737
00:46:53,243 --> 00:46:55,108
你等着去午门斩首吧
You're as good as dead.

738
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:57,043
抓他回去，快点
Take him back, quick.

739
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,980
冤枉呀，不关我的事
I'm innocent.

740
00:46:59,082 --> 00:47:00,242
是他呀，冤枉呀
It's him, I'm innocent.

741
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:03,211
一、二、三、四、五
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

742
00:47:03,253 --> 00:47:07,986
六、七、八、九、十
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

743
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:10,117
十一、十二、十三
11, 12, 13.

744
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,993
十四、十五、十六
14, 15, 16.

745
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:21,135
十七、十八、十九、二十
17, 18, 19, 20.

746
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:34,276
兄弟，可不可以拿杯水给我？
Buddy, can I have some water?

747
00:47:35,052 --> 00:47:36,212
你还有知觉喝水？
Can you feel thirst?

748
00:47:36,286 --> 00:47:39,221
如果不是皇上大婚，你早就被斩头了
You're a dead man but for the royal wedding.

749
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:42,082
求求你，我真的很口喝
Please, I'm so thirsty.

750
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:44,218
可以，先叫我做契爷
Alright, but call me sugar-daddy.

751
00:47:45,128 --> 00:47:46,254
契爷
Sugar-daddy.

752
00:47:50,133 --> 00:47:51,065
公公吉祥
Your lordship.

753
00:47:51,168 --> 00:47:53,227
你们不要再耍我了
Don't play jokes on me, please.

754
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:57,035
奴才该死…
Your servant's at your mercy.

755
00:48:02,179 --> 00:48:03,271
公公吉祥
Your lordship.

756
00:48:04,014 --> 00:48:08,041
春福，你们俩去御茶房拿酸梅汤来
Chun Fu, get me some plum juice.

757
00:48:08,118 --> 00:48:09,278
是
Yes.

758
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:17,117
敬事房、交泰殿、内左门、内右门
It is a conspiracy of the grandest scale.

759
00:48:17,194 --> 00:48:18,183
干清门、御书房

760
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:20,992
十三宫的总管首领串同一起
Masters of 13 houses are all in it.

761
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,225
你是不是走黑运呀？
Tough luck for you.

762
00:48:24,234 --> 00:48:26,202
是，奴才该死
Yes, "your servant" deserves it.

763
00:48:26,270 --> 00:48:28,170
大清二百多年的国宝，古玩文物
The historical treasures of Ching.

764
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,172
竟然当废物论斤的卖给人家
Being sold like junk.

765
00:48:30,274 --> 00:48:33,209
皇上被小人蒙蔽
His Majesty has been deceived.

766
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:35,245
如果这些事发生在十年前
If all this happened 10 years ago.

767
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:38,077
我要好好惩诫这班卖国贼
I would have them executed.

768
00:48:38,148 --> 00:48:41,117
但是现在过了十年，那怎么办？
But this is not 10 years ago.

769
00:48:44,187 --> 00:48:47,054
春禄，让你的伤好了之后
Chun Lu, when you are recovered.

770
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:50,285
我要你直谏皇上，你能做得到吗？
I want you to report it to His Majesty.

771
00:48:51,161 --> 00:48:53,152
是，奴才做得到
Yes, your servant will do so.

772
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:55,027
好
Good.

773
00:48:55,132 --> 00:48:58,101
我会替你好好安排…
I'll arrange it for you, I will.

774
00:48:58,168 --> 00:49:01,001
大清有救了
There's hope for the Ching Dynasty.

775
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:03,262
奴才该死…
Your servant's at your mercy.

776
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:06,134
该死的不只你一个
Not just you.

777
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:17,051
娘娘贺寿，你安排的那出戏唱得真好
It was a good show.

778
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:18,087
叫什么呀？
For Her Highness's birthday.

779
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:20,020
八仙贺寿
That was "The 8 fairies' birthday gifts".

780
00:49:20,090 --> 00:49:21,216
这是小人该做的事
Just part of my duty.

781
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:25,058
替主子安排玩乐是小人的责任
To entertain the masters.

782
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:27,256
对了，丁公公，你叫小人来
Oh, Lord Ting.

783
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:29,191
不知道有什么事呢？
Is there anything I can do for you?

784
00:49:29,266 --> 00:49:32,133
没什么，我种了一盆未成器的盆栽
I have this budding plant.

785
00:49:32,202 --> 00:49:35,194
请赵公公你过目，指点指点
Which I would like you to see and comment of.

786
00:49:35,272 --> 00:49:37,206
不敢当，我是外行
I am no expert.

787
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:39,139
你是内行
You are so.

788
00:49:39,176 --> 00:49:41,076
不，我是外行

948
01:00:44,307 --> 01:00:47,242
我真的不争气
It's all my fault.

949
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:51,144
老佛爷，奴才对不起你
I have let you down, Your Majesty Dowager.

950
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,272
皇上有难，我只会敲经念佛
I could only pray when His Majesty was in trouble.

951
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:58,020
我没用
I'm so useless.

952
01:00:58,087 --> 01:00:59,179
丁公公，你不要这个样子
Don't, My lord.

953
01:00:59,288 --> 01:01:02,280
我没用，我连一个忠心报国的徒弟
I can't even keep a loyal servant.

954
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:04,083
也找不到

955
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:05,185
丁公公…
Lord Ting, Lord Ting.

956
01:01:05,261 --> 01:01:07,058
我要一死以谢天下
I'll die to pay for my guilty.

957
01:01:07,096 --> 01:01:08,222
丁公公，不要这样子
Don't, please.

958
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:09,286
你让我去死吧
Let me die.

959
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:12,024
你不要拉着我，你让我去死吧
Don't stop me, let me die.

960
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:14,092
我没用，你让我去死吧
I'm useless, let me die.

961
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,229
你让我去死吧
Le me die.

962
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:19,105
我要死，我不死也没有用
Let me die.

963
01:01:19,175 --> 01:01:21,040
丁公公，不要这样子
Please don't be this way.

964
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:22,236
我要死…
I want to die.

965
01:01:22,311 --> 01:01:24,006
不要呀
Stop that.

966
01:01:27,283 --> 01:01:29,217
奴才该死
Your servant's at your mercy.

967
01:01:32,055 --> 01:01:34,990
招弟，  你开门吧
Open up, Tsouti.

968
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:36,116
我不是回去做太监呀
I'm not becoming a eunuch again.

969
01:01:36,225 --> 01:01:42,289
你开门吧，招弟…
Open up, Tsouti.

970
01:02:13,196 --> 01:02:16,188
请公公见谅，奴才该死
Forgive me, My lord.

971
01:02:16,265 --> 01:02:20,224
我不用人家可怜，我跳河死了算了
I need no sympathy, I'd rather die.

972
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:22,162
丁公公
Lord Ting.

973
01:02:23,272 --> 01:02:27,265
没有了真命天子，中国何以为国？
Without an emperor, there is no empire.

974
01:02:28,077 --> 01:02:30,136
我宁死也不做亡国奴
How can one be without a country?

975
01:02:30,213 --> 01:02:34,047
无国又何以为家呢？
Without the county there is no home.

976
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:37,119
丁公公，你想我怎么样？
What do you want me to do?

977
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:39,987
你舍不舍得抛弃这个贱人？
Can you give her up?

978
01:02:40,056 --> 01:02:43,184
不舍得的话就跟我滚回去
If not, get out of my sight.

979
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:48,052
舍得的话，明天就跟我去见皇上
If yes, we'll see the emperor tomorrow.

980
01:03:12,221 --> 01:03:14,189
我肚子不饿，你先吃饭吧
I'm not hungry, you go ahead.

981
01:03:15,124 --> 01:03:19,060
酸梅要干了水才可以踩呀
Let the plums dry first before squashing.

982
01:03:21,097 --> 01:03:23,258
见皇上真的那么重要？
Is it so important to see the emperor?

983
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:25,227
丁公公说皇上有难
He's in trouble.

984
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:28,061
凭你们两个可以救皇上？
What can you two do?

985
01:03:28,271 --> 01:03:31,138
丁公公说我们去服侍皇上
He said the emperor needs our services.

986
01:03:32,041 --> 01:03:33,269
皇上需要我们
What about us?

987
01:03:34,177 --> 01:03:38,011
皇上需要你，那我和京生怎么样呀？

988
01:03:38,114 --> 01:03:41,049
你放心，我已经跟面店的张伯
I have talked to our clients.

989
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:42,277
家乡味的老黄
The noodle shops and the restaurants.

990
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:44,247
路口的张婶说好了

991
01:03:45,054 --> 01:03:48,182
只要你每天送酸梅汤去就行了
Just deliver the plum juice to them.

992
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:51,283
你不要开档，太辛苦了
Never mind the cart.

993
01:03:53,062 --> 01:03:55,053
是呀，记得酸梅要干了水才能踩呀
And let the plums dry before squashing.

994
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:57,291
记得酸梅干了水才能踩
Let the plums dry before squashing.

995
01:03:58,034 --> 01:04:00,229
要放冰糖，不要加太多水
Use rock-sugar, not too much water.

996
01:04:01,037 --> 01:04:04,097
够了，我要听的不是这些东西
Enough. I want to hear no more.

997
01:04:07,076 --> 01:04:08,168
你说，是不是服侍皇上
Is the emperor more important than us?

998
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:10,041
比跟我们两母子一起好呀？
Don't forget you are just a eunuch?

999
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:11,136
一天到晚就皇上皇上

1000
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:14,081
你不可以忘记自己是太…

1001
01:04:15,051 --> 01:04:16,985
是，我是
Yes, I am.

1002
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:19,020
我是一个太监
I am a eunuch.

1003
01:04:21,090 --> 01:04:23,991
你知不知道我和你在一起的时候
When we are together

1004
01:04:24,060 --> 01:04:27,086
我就算被人家取笑，我都可以忍受
I can stand people laughing at me.

1005
01:04:28,130 --> 01:04:30,155
因为我已经习惯了
I'm used to it.

1006
01:04:31,200 --> 01:04:32,292
但是如果有人取笑你
But it hurts when they laugh at you.

1007
01:04:33,069 --> 01:04:35,196
我心里就很难过
Chinsheng needs a father.

1008
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:39,072
京生需要爸爸

1009
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:43,269
而皇上就需要太监
And His Majesty needs eunuchs.

1010
01:04:44,280 --> 01:04:45,247
所以…
That's why...

1011
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:48,040
所以你就要跟丁公公走？
That's why you have to go.

1012
01:04:49,185 --> 01:04:51,244
难道你不想和我们好好的过日子吗？
Don't you want us to live happily together.

1013
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:54,285
想，我不是不想
Of course, but...

1014
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:05,152
狗仗人势的畜生
Your running dogs.

1015
01:06:09,098 --> 01:06:12,033
就是他们两个要见皇上
These two want to see His Majesty.

1016
01:06:14,236 --> 01:06:16,067
我们是专诚来侍候皇上的

1017
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:17,196
请你让我们见皇上吧
Please let us.

1018
01:06:17,239 --> 01:06:18,228
你说要入就入的吗
See His Majesty.

1019
01:06:18,307 --> 01:06:20,275
你当这里是什么地方？
Where do you think.

1020
01:06:28,217 --> 01:06:31,050
叫他们走，不知所为
You are?

1021
01:06:32,154 --> 01:06:35,214
他说什么？
Send them away, such nonsense.

1022
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:41,186
他说，这里不是皇宫，不用你们侍候
What did he say?

1023
01:06:41,263 --> 01:06:42,252
叫你们走
He said this was not a Palace, no need for you.

1024
01:06:42,999 --> 01:06:44,091
放肆
Told you to go away.

1025
01:06:44,166 --> 01:06:47,033
侍候皇上随便什么人都可以的吗？
Nonsense.

1026
01:06:47,103 --> 01:06:49,094
是呀，请你们让我们见皇上吧
His Majesty needs us.

1027
01:06:49,205 --> 01:06:50,194
如果他真的不需要我们
Yes, let us see him.

1028
01:06:50,272 --> 01:06:52,172
我们就走
If he really doesn't need us, we'll go.

1029
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:55,141
走吧，也不知道现在是什么时代
Go, times have changed.

1030
01:06:55,177 --> 01:06:56,269
皇帝有我们来照顾
We'll take care of the emperor.

1031
01:06:57,046 --> 01:06:58,138
站着
Stand still.

1032
01:06:58,280 --> 01:06:59,269
什么？
What?

1033
01:07:00,116 --> 01:07:01,083
春禄
Chun Lu.

1034
01:07:01,150 --> 01:07:02,048
是
Yes.

1035
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:03,176
验明净身
Check him out.

1036
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:08,019
春禄，去吧
Chun Lu, go ahead.

1037
01:07:08,224 --> 01:07:10,055
是
Yes.

1038
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:20,032
什么？你想干什么？
What are you doing?

1039
01:07:20,102 --> 01:07:21,126
这里是日本人的地方
This is Japanese property

1040
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:23,035
不是每个中国人都能进来的
no Chinese allowed.

1041
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:25,130
尤其是你这些奴才
Especially you, dummies.

1042
01:07:28,077 --> 01:07:30,978
走吧，奴才
Go away, dummies.

1043
01:07:34,183 --> 01:07:37,084
回公公，那个奴才很不干净
My lord, not clean at all.

1044
01:07:37,286 --> 01:07:39,186
赶他们走
Send them away.

1045
01:07:41,123 --> 01:07:42,283
赶我们？混帐
Nonsense.

1046
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:46,187
皇上圣体，岂容你们左右侍奉？滚开
You have no right to serve His Majesty.

1047
01:07:46,262 --> 01:07:47,286
戆居
Ridiculous.

1048
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:53,161
丁公公，我们先回去吧
Let's go back now.

1049
01:07:53,235 --> 01:07:56,136
不可以，我是总管，我要见皇上
No, I'm a master, I'll see the emperor.

1050
01:07:56,205 --> 01:07:57,194
公公
My lord.

1051
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:10,115
公公
My lord.

1052
01:08:28,237 --> 01:08:33,197
我可以没了宝贝，不可以没了皇上
I'd give up my thing just to see His Majesty.

1053
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:36,244
公公
My lord.

1054
01:08:39,148 --> 01:08:42,049
皇上英明…
Our glorious Emperor.

1055
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,245
我们走
Let's go.

1056
01:08:48,190 --> 01:08:49,248
公公
My lord.

1057
01:08:54,029 --> 01:08:56,190
皇上吉祥
Long live the Emperor.

1058
01:09:18,020 --> 01:09:23,014
美丽底月亮已给黑漆底乌云盖上
The cloud hides the moon.

1059
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:26,128
蔚蓝的天空已给黑色的
The ugly wings of a crow

1060
01:09:26,195 --> 01:09:31,030
乌鸦的、丑陋的翅膀掩蔽
cover the blue sky

1061
01:09:31,133 --> 01:09:35,263
多么可怕
So terrifying.

1062
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:00,219
我现在将我的宝贝跟你一起埋葬
I'll bury the thing with you.

1063
01:10:00,296 --> 01:10:05,290
希望你有个全尸，来世可以投胎做人
So you can come back a complete man.

1064
01:10:06,202 --> 01:10:11,162
其实，一个真正的太监才要宝贝陪着
A real eunuch needs a thing.

1065
01:10:12,141 --> 01:10:14,041
我以后都不再做太监了
I'm a eunuch no more.

1066
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:18,078
而且，割了下来的宝贝
What comes off

1067
01:10:18,147 --> 01:10:20,081
根本不属于任何人
doesn't belong anymore.

1068
01:11:03,058 --> 01:11:04,252
死兔崽子，一天到晚往外跑
You naughty thing.

1069
01:11:05,027 --> 01:11:05,254
你再不回家
Come home

1070
01:11:06,028 --> 01:11:08,189
我以后不理你了，知道吗？
or I'll lock you out.

1071
01:11:09,164 --> 01:11:11,064
不要哭了
Don't cry.

1072
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,187
招弟
Tsouti.

1073
01:11:34,256 --> 01:11:37,157
我知道这次走了，令你伤心
I know I hurt you so much.

1074
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:42,996
我很后悔这么糊涂，留下你们两个
I feel so regretful leaving you.

1075
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:44,191
干出这么无谓的事
And did such a ridiculous thing.

1076
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,259
本来我决定带同丁公公回来
I would have brought him home.

1077
01:11:47,303 --> 01:11:51,205
可惜他已经死掉了
But he's dead now.

1078
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:55,166
我这次回来，不知你会不会原谅我？
Will you forgive me?

1079
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:58,146
你不出声，是不是还在生我的气？
Are you still angry?

1080
01:11:58,247 --> 01:12:00,078
招弟
Tsouti.

1081
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:04,051
既然你不肯原谅我，我走了
Maybe I'll go away.

1082
01:12:14,296 --> 01:12:17,060
你看看你，整个脸都是泥
Look at you, full of mud.

1083
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:20,101
先洗脸吧
Go wash your face first.

1084
01:12:23,005 --> 01:12:24,165
谢谢
Thank you.

1085
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:35,114
招弟  ，我…
Tsouti...

1086
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:38,077
我想…
I want to...

1087
01:12:38,153 --> 01:12:39,142
你想怎么样？
What do you want?

1088
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:41,155
我想你嫁给我，做我的老婆
I want to marry you.

1089
01:12:41,223 --> 01:12:43,020
你说什么？
What did you say?

1090
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:46,119
我想你嫁给我，做我的老婆
I want to marry you.

1091
01:12:49,264 --> 01:12:51,164
你答应我吗？
Will you marry me?

1092
01:12:53,302 --> 01:12:56,999
你究竟答不答应我？你说吧
Will you marry me? Answer me please.

1093
01:12:59,174 --> 01:13:01,074
你不用说
Alright.

1094
01:13:01,143 --> 01:13:03,111
如果你答应我的话，你就不要踩
Stop squashing and it means yes.

1095
01:13:03,178 --> 01:13:07,274
如果你不答应我的话，那你继续踩吧
Carrying on means no.

1096
01:13:21,296 --> 01:13:23,127
你是不答应我的了
So the answer is no.

1097
01:13:23,198 --> 01:13:25,063
我什么也没有说过
I didn't say anything.

1098
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:27,295
不过，这些酸梅汤明天要交给人家的
But we need to deliver tomorrow.

1099
01:13:28,036 --> 01:13:30,004
你答应我吧
Say yes please.

1100
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:33,267
好吧
Yes.

1101
01:13:35,244 --> 01:13:36,268
你干什么？
What are you doing?

1102
01:13:51,260 --> 01:13:53,194
我已经下定决心了
I have made up my mind.

1103
01:13:57,099 --> 01:14:00,091
你这个样子就叫我嫁给你？难了
Look at you, how can I say yes?

1104
01:14:04,306 --> 01:14:07,104
我现在立刻出去把它剃掉
I'll cut it off.

1105
01:14:07,276 --> 01:14:09,005
交给你
For you.

1106
01:14:09,077 --> 01:14:10,066
我今晚顺便买些东西回来
I'll bring something back.

1107
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:13,047
我们一家人开开心心庆祝一番
We three are going to celebrate.

1108
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:17,047
等一等
Wait.

1109
01:14:23,258 --> 01:14:27,024
京生阿爹，外边冷呀，多穿件衣服吧
It's cold outside, Chinsheng's father.

1110
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:29,062
京生阿爹？
Chinsheng's father.

1111
01:14:30,265 --> 01:14:32,199
我是京生阿爹？
I'm Chinsheng's father?

1112
01:14:34,002 --> 01:14:35,196
京生阿爹…
Chinsheng's father...

1113
01:14:37,072 --> 01:14:39,097
我是京生阿爹
I'm Chinsheng's father.

1114
01:14:58,126 --> 01:14:59,991
为什么单独坐在这里呀？
Why are you sitting there alone?

1115
01:15:00,128 --> 01:15:02,995
买给京生的，你看漂不漂亮？
For Chinsheng, isn't it pretty?

1116
01:15:07,069 --> 01:15:08,229
你不舒服吗？
Are you ill?

1117
01:15:10,072 --> 01:15:11,232
有人来了
Someone's here.

1118
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:25,144
来喜
Laishi.

1119
01:15:32,127 --> 01:15:33,185
你好
How are you?

1120
01:15:34,162 --> 01:15:36,130
随便坐…
Make yourself at home.

1121
01:15:36,231 --> 01:15:40,065
瞧瞧你有客人来也不预早通知我
You should have told me earlier.

1122
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:45,003
真对不起，我还没有…
I'm sorry, I am...

1123
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:47,072
我还没有招呼你
I am not a very good host.

1124
01:15:47,142 --> 01:15:48,234
其实我家里也没有什么可以招呼的
We have not much to offer.

1125
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:50,210
不如给碗酸梅汤你
Have a plum juice.

1126
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:52,247
很好喝的，不会酸的
Good stuff.

1127
01:16:00,255 --> 01:16:02,189
你没有对他说我们的事吗？
Have you told him about us?

1128
01:16:04,059 --> 01:16:05,151
有
Yes.

1129
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:07,154
为什么你现在才来找我？
Why do you come now?

1130
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:11,188
不是现在，是从来也没有放弃过
I have never given up.

01:16:12,100 --> 01:16:14,000
招弟

1132
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:18,164
招弟
Tsouti.

1133
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:27,205
你不是革命党？
You are a rebel?

1134
01:16:28,250 --> 01:16:30,115
我是
Yes, I am.

1135
01:16:32,087 --> 01:16:33,247
又说他死了？
You said he was dead.

1136
01:16:35,223 --> 01:16:36,986
来喜
Laishi.

1137
01:16:37,259 --> 01:16:39,124
汤倒泻了
The juice is spilled.

1138
01:16:39,194 --> 01:16:45,030
汤倒泻了可以再倒，但是…
It can be filled again, but...

1139
01:16:46,068 --> 01:16:47,228
你说得对

1140
01:16:48,236 --> 01:16:51,103
我不应该在这个时候回来找你们
I shouldn't have come at this time.

1141
01:16:55,177 --> 01:16:58,146
很多谢这两年来你照顾他们母子俩
Thank you for taking care of them.

1142
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:02,045
这次回来能够再见他们
I'm too happy already.

1143
01:17:04,052 --> 01:17:06,043
我已经很开心了
To be able to see those two.

1144
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:16,093
汉民
Hanming.

1145
01:17:33,048 --> 01:17:34,140
孩子，孩子乖
Good boy, good boy.

1146
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:37,242
孩子乖，乖
Good boy, good boy.

1147
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:54,192
招弟
Tsouti.

1148
01:17:58,173 --> 01:18:00,141
不要哭，乖
Don't cry.

1149
01:18:01,076 --> 01:18:02,202
来喜
Laishi.

1150
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:08,014
我已经决定了，明天就走
I've made up my mind. I'll leave tomorrow.

1151
01:18:08,116 --> 01:18:11,108
要走的不只你一个，是你们
Not just you, but you two.

1152
01:18:11,286 --> 01:18:13,220
她常常跟我提起你
She always talks about you.

1153
01:18:14,156 --> 01:18:17,023
她也跟我说了很多关于你的事
I know a lot.

1154
01:18:19,127 --> 01:18:20,253
京生他…
Chinsheng, he...

1155
01:18:21,129 --> 01:18:22,187
你们也把他带走？
Take him with you...

1156
01:18:22,264 --> 01:18:24,027
是
Yes.

1157
01:18:29,171 --> 01:18:32,197
再见陈老师…
Goodbye Mr Chen.

1158
01:18:32,307 --> 01:18:35,140
快点回来呀…
Hurry back.

1159
01:18:42,017 --> 01:18:43,985
为什么来喜还不来送我们呢？
Why isn't Laishi here to see us off?

1160
01:18:44,219 --> 01:18:45,117
不知道会不会…
Could it be?

1161
01:18:45,187 --> 01:18:46,154
他不会的
He said.

1162
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:49,190
他说要开档，开完档就来送我们
He would come.

1163
01:18:49,291 --> 01:18:53,091
而且他很胆心我们的安全
He's so worried about us too.

1164
01:18:53,195 --> 01:18:54,253
那最好了
Alright then.

1165
01:19:13,148 --> 01:19:15,275
买了，上车吧
Get on.

1166
01:20:12,073 --> 01:20:14,132
走开…
Get away.

1167
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:18,002
大家醒醒吧…
Wake up, you, wake up.

1168
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:19,137
打倒民国
Down with the Republic.

1169
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:22,275
大清必胜，打倒民国
Ching will be restored.

1170
01:20:23,218 --> 01:20:24,981
大家醒醒
Wake up people.

1171
01:20:25,053 --> 01:20:26,077
走开
Get away.

1172
01:20:26,154 --> 01:20:27,246
皇帝万岁
Long live the Emperor.

1173
01:20:28,023 --> 01:20:29,183
谢谢
Thank you.

1174
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:32,184
大清必胜，皇帝万岁
Ching will be restored, long live the Emperor.

1175
01:20:32,260 --> 01:20:33,227
发神经
Crazy.

1176
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:35,092
我是皇帝的太监
I'm the emperor's eunuch.

1177
01:20:35,130 --> 01:20:37,189
皇帝很快就来这里，你们还不快回避
The emperor is arriving soon.

1178
01:20:37,265 --> 01:20:39,130
是不是想杀头？是不是想杀头？
Hide yourselves. Want to be dead?

1179
01:20:45,106 --> 01:20:46,198
你们这班贱民，以下犯上

1180
01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:47,206
是不是想死？
You low lives want to die.

1181
01:20:47,275 --> 01:20:50,039
想死？想死的是你，不是我
You are the one who should be dead.

1182
01:20:50,078 --> 01:20:53,070
太监？太你的头，瓣子也没有
Eunuch? Where's your pig-tail?

1183
01:20:53,215 --> 01:20:55,080
在这里发什么神经？
Such a ridiculous thing to say.

1184
01:20:55,116 --> 01:20:57,050
还不走就拉你去打靶
Go now, or we'll have you executed.

1185
01:20:57,118 --> 01:20:58,176
我真的是太监呀
I am a eunuch.

1186
01:20:58,286 --> 01:21:00,117
好
Alright.

1187
01:21:11,166 --> 01:21:13,100
你带几个人上车搜查
Search the coach.

1188
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:14,190
跟我来
Follow me.

1189
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:16,100
是

1190
01:21:22,277 --> 01:21:24,074
站着
Stand still.

1191
01:21:25,013 --> 01:21:26,173
举起双手

1192
01:21:31,152 --> 01:21:32,210
走吧

1193
01:21:33,255 --> 01:21:34,187
别动
Don't move.

1194
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:36,052
走吧
Go.

1195
01:21:39,060 --> 01:21:40,220
你，起来
You, stand up.

1196
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:42,088
从那里来的？    山东
- Where are you from? - Shantung.

1197
01:21:42,163 --> 01:21:43,187
不用怕    山东？
- It's alright. - Shantung?

1198
01:21:43,265 --> 01:21:44,254
有没有带枪？
Carrying a pistol?

1199
01:21:45,000 --> 01:21:46,160
我不敢带枪
No, I dare not.

1200
01:21:47,135 --> 01:21:48,159
坐下
Sit down.

1201
01:21:56,111 --> 01:21:58,079
癫佬，你发神经呀
Are you crazy?

1202
01:21:58,146 --> 01:22:00,011
什么事？
What's up?

1203
01:22:01,116 --> 01:22:02,174
跟我来
Come with me.

1204
01:22:07,155 --> 01:22:09,180
来，你们来检验吧
Come, check it out.

1205
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:11,088
验一验我是不是太监？
See if I'm really a eunuch?

1206
01:22:11,159 --> 01:22:12,183
谁说我不是太监？
Who says I'm not?

1207
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:14,057
没有瓣子就是假的吗？
Even without a pig-tail.

1208
01:22:14,095 --> 01:22:15,187
没有下面是不是真的？
There's nothing down there, right?

1209
01:22:15,263 --> 01:22:17,993
来，你检验一下
Come check it out.

1210
01:22:21,169 --> 01:22:23,160
来，来检验一下，验一下
Come, come, check it out.

1211
01:22:23,238 --> 01:22:25,001
捉住他
Get him.

1212
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:37,243
贱格
Scum.

1213
01:22:39,220 --> 01:22:41,017
装模作样
Fraud.

1214
01:22:50,065 --> 01:22:51,999
你没有的，还会痛吗？
How could that hurt, there's nothing there.

1215
01:22:53,268 --> 01:22:54,292
起来
Get up.

1216
01:22:55,236 --> 01:22:57,033
起来，打我吧
Get up and hit me.

1217
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:07,136
废物
Trash.

1218
01:23:07,215 --> 01:23:09,274
贱格、下流、卑鄙
Scum.

1219
01:23:17,125 --> 01:23:19,059
走    是
- Go. - Yes.

1220
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:24,992
夜已深深得似一张黑幕
Night, jet black night.

1221
01:24:26,161 --> 01:24:33,033
尽隔开欢笑留寂寞
Enveloping my solitude.

1222
01:24:35,036 --> 01:24:44,069
骤冷的空气冻结热情感觉
Chilling friendly feelings.

1223
01:24:44,179 --> 01:24:54,020
令我心跟冷风一样萧索
Making me shiver and shiver.

1224
01:24:54,289 --> 01:25:00,125
一生可得到几许欢乐
Life yields little mirth.

1225
01:25:01,229 --> 01:25:07,134
幸福只偶然拾获
Good fortune's a random harvest.

1226
01:25:08,169 --> 01:25:12,037
没法得到想要
What one wants is beyond reach.

1227
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:15,201
得到不等于快乐
Fulfillment is not really happiness.

1228
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:22,205
或许一切出于错觉
Excuse me if I am wrong.

1229
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:29,250
或会将所想寻获
Perhaps there's light at the end of tunnel.

1230
01:25:30,024 --> 01:25:37,021
可惜我心思不再像旧时
My thinking has changed.

1231
01:25:37,165 --> 01:25:44,230
突破思想空壳我似骤然醒觉
It brings me face to face with reality.

1232
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:51,270
或许一切出于错觉
Excuse me if I am wrong.

1233
01:25:52,046 --> 01:25:58,246
或会将所想寻获
Perhaps there's light at the end of tunnel.

1234
01:25:59,020 --> 01:26:05,255
可惜我心思不再像旧时
My thinking has changed.

1235
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:13,091
突破思想空壳我似骤然醒觉
It brings me face to face with reality.

1236
01:26:13,168 --> 01:26:21,075
或许一切出于错觉
Excuse me if I am wrong.
