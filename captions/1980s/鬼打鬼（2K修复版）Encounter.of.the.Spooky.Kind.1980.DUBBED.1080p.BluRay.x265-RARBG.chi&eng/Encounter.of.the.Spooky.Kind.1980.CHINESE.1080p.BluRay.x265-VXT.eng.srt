1
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,199
Why are you sighing?

2
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,236
I'm just worried about you.

3
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,954
I've been waiting here more than a decade
for an opportunity.

4
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,242
You've just arrived,
with no idea how long you'll have to wait.

5
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:30,163
Not necessarily,
maybe my luck's better than yours.

6
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,168
I thought the same way, too.

7
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:34,632
But then even my bones grew uncertain.

8
00:01:34,678 --> 00:01:36,634
I don't want you to be like me.

9
00:01:36,638 --> 00:01:38,253
Uncle, you're so nice.

10
00:01:38,307 --> 00:01:40,639
You don't know
just how hypocritical people up there are.

11
00:01:40,726 --> 00:01:43,934
If everyone were like you,
I wouldn't be down here.

12
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:45,014
Is that right?

13
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:47,429
All that's left of me are these old bones.

14
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:48,897
You're still young.

15
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,937
I also hope you'll make it one day.

16
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,652
Uncle, how are you?

17
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:55,813
I'm fine.

18
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:59,316
Maybe this hole's getting bigger,
and I've caught a bit of a chill.

19
00:01:59,328 --> 00:02:02,240
Move over here when I'm gone, then.
Help yourself.

20
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,239
Someone's coming.

21
00:02:13,258 --> 00:02:14,418
It's a fat guy.

22
00:02:14,426 --> 00:02:16,667
The fatty's mine.

23
00:02:16,762 --> 00:02:19,720
Uncle, you're wrong to say that.

24
00:02:19,765 --> 00:02:22,177
How am I wrong?
I've been waiting for this day.

25
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:24,007
Why are you such a hypocrite?

26
00:02:24,102 --> 00:02:28,186
This isn't hypocrisy,
it's reality.

27
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:29,521
You old bastard!

28
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,558
Young man, don't be impetuous.

29
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,558
Don't be hasty.

30
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:35,923
If I'm not hasty, I'll have to wait
decades just like you said!

31
00:02:35,947 --> 00:02:38,108
All things must have
a beginning and an end.

32
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:40,448
Ghosts must never fight ghosts.

33
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:42,450
Let's see who has the means.

34
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:43,656
Fine.

35
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,384
Old man, don't be greedy!

36
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:16,328
That was really scary!

37
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:19,964
You trying to scare me to death?

38
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,333
More like you scared me to death!

39
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,217
- You see a ghost?
- How did you know?

40
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:26,096
If it wasn't a ghost, you wouldn't
be screaming like a man possessed!

41
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:29,178
Those two ghosts,
don't know if they were crazy,

42
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,259
but they just kept chasing me!

43
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,390
You're this scared
from seeing ghosts in your dreams.

44
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:38,559
Aren't you always saying you've got guts?

45
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,685
Like that needs to be said!

46
00:04:39,738 --> 00:04:42,578
Who in this village doesn't know
your husband's name is big guts cheung?

47
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:43,446
Ghosts, that's all!

48
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:45,406
- You'll definitely be seeing some.
- Why?

49
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:48,239
As the saying goes:
Poorer you are, the more it haunts you.

50
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:50,558
The way I see it,
you'll soon be crushed by your own demons!

51
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:52,447
You're the one
who'll be crushed by demons!

52
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,080
Better crushed by demons
than crushed by you!

53
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,463
This dress...

54
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:05,009
Does it make you look bad?

55
00:05:05,055 --> 00:05:06,386
Where did you get such a beautiful dress?

56
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:08,755
- Bought it.
- Bought it?

57
00:05:08,767 --> 00:05:10,803
This dress looks very expensive.

58
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,717
It's not like I used your money.

59
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,560
What are you so stressed about?

60
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,936
You didn't use my money...?
Whose did you use, then?!

61
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,104
Used? I used my own!

62
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,313
Yours?

63
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:23,277
How come you've got so much money?

64
00:05:24,574 --> 00:05:27,111
If you're thrifty...
If you're thrifty, you'll have money!

65
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:31,035
If you're thrifty...
You'll have money?

66
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:37,037
Aren't you going to work?

67
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,205
Today's the ghost festival.

68
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:41,046
Master tam said he won't be going out,
so I don't have to work.

69
00:05:41,258 --> 00:05:43,294
- Want to go for tea?
- No.

70
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,833
Suit yourself.

71
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,585
I'm going, then.

72
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:49,383
Pork buns!

73
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:53,599
Hey...

74
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,184
Ah dou, here so early?

75
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,600
Eat what you like.
The meal's on me.

76
00:05:57,649 --> 00:05:59,935
Big guts cheung, you're great!

77
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,558
They really named you right.

78
00:06:01,611 --> 00:06:02,566
You don't say?!

79
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:05,438
In this town, who doesn't know
I've got the biggest guts?

80
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:09,782
Pfft, what's so great about
tempting the spirits of unmarked graves?

81
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,155
Think you're clever?

82
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,696
I know of a game that comes from the west.

83
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,161
It's already scared
plenty of foreigners to death!

84
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:19,205
We're scaring foreigners now?

85
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:20,539
Hey, how do you play it?

86
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:22,037
Peel an apple.

87
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,458
So long as...

88
00:06:23,675 --> 00:06:24,710
Peeling an apple?!

89
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:26,333
And here I thought you had something.

90
00:06:26,595 --> 00:06:29,211
Don't go cutting in midsong.
Let him finish first.

91
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,258
Alright, finish chirping then.

92
00:06:31,892 --> 00:06:34,304
Midnight. Take an apple.

93
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:37,766
Light a candle. Face a mirror.

94
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,227
Peel with a knife.
Don't break the peel.

95
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,642
When you're done peeling...

96
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:44,778
What then?

97
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,774
You'll see what you want to see.

98
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:47,775
That for real?

99
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,735
What if the peel breaks?

100
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:55,366
Then some horrific things will appear,
the likes of which you've never seen.

101
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,996
Maybe even...

102
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,454
Who you trying to scare?
I don't believe it.

103
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:00,624
So arrogant!

104
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,126
You have the guts to give it a try?

105
00:07:02,172 --> 00:07:05,505
If someone's treating me to tea,
I'll do it any time.

106
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,757
Ok. Tomorrow's meal is on me.

107
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,085
- Tonight, you come to my house.
- Ok.

108
00:07:10,096 --> 00:07:12,132
Now, help yourself.
Eat all you want.

109
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:14,764
This meal's on me.
Someone's paying.

110
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,975
Hey, waitress,
set one more place.

111
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,719
Hey, there's another meal tomorrow.

112
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,058
Don't forget.

113
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,772
Go.

114
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,430
I broke the peel.

115
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:48,062
I wonder what horrific things
will happen now?

116
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,739
Come on...

117
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:01,279
Why's a female ghost wearing men's shoes?

118
00:09:03,626 --> 00:09:05,582
Why are those eyes so familiar?

119
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:08,457
Turns out, it's ah do...

120
00:09:08,465 --> 00:09:10,171
You're finished!

121
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,339
Come out...

122
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,049
Quickly, come out!

123
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,009
Coming out...

124
00:09:19,768 --> 00:09:21,349
How dare you make a fool of me?!

125
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:23,093
I'll beat you up!

126
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:24,894
I was only joking with you.

127
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,139
Joking?!
You could've scared me to death!

128
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,267
How could that be?
You've got some real big guts, remember?

129
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,445
Hey, stop the fanning now!

130
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,364
We've been busted!

131
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:42,032
We've been busted?

132
00:09:42,165 --> 00:09:43,405
Hey, you can stop fanning!

133
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,793
- How come you got busted?
- Oh, so you teamed up to scare me?

134
00:09:48,797 --> 00:09:51,630
Say no more.
Go light the candles.

135
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,549
- You...
- Actually, we didn't mean it.

136
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,442
There's no denying it,
you really have big guts!

137
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,159
My god,
you only had to light them again!

138
00:10:22,664 --> 00:10:23,870
Hey...

139
00:10:24,082 --> 00:10:26,994
- Hey... what's wrong?
- There's a ghost! Let's go!

140
00:10:27,669 --> 00:10:29,580
How did you come out of the mirror?

141
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,085
I have a way, of course.

142
00:10:31,131 --> 00:10:32,131
Come.

143
00:10:32,674 --> 00:10:34,539
The mirror's manoeuvrable.

144
00:10:34,676 --> 00:10:36,667
Slide it down and you can see me.

145
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,509
I slide it back up...

146
00:10:38,596 --> 00:10:41,258
How can you see me in the mirror now?

147
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,344
Listen, I'm telling you,
I'm not afraid of real ghosts.

148
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:47,184
But there's no cure
for scaring someone to death!

149
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:49,888
You ever do anything like this again,
I'll...

150
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,816
Alright, I admit defeat.
Tea's on me.

151
00:10:52,944 --> 00:10:56,061
Don't lose your temper.
I'll pour you tea to apologise.

152
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,358
Come on, forgive me.

153
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:01,942
You really live up to the name
big guts cheung.

154
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:03,222
- They really named you right.
- There's no more to be said.

155
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:05,862
- Drink up.
- After this, we're even. But never again!

156
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:18,299
Hey, that's enough!

157
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,918
Hiding to try and scare me again?

158
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:21,757
I'll lose my temper!

159
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,064
He's not here?

160
00:11:53,004 --> 00:11:54,744
If I find you, you're a dead man!

161
00:11:59,677 --> 00:12:01,258
Where'd he go?

162
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:07,557
Ah mou! Ah pang!

163
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:15,226
What's this?

164
00:13:07,245 --> 00:13:08,360
Ol' cheung!

165
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:09,864
What is it, master tam?

166
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:12,993
Remember,
don't tell anyone where I'm going.

167
00:13:13,001 --> 00:13:16,243
Don't worry, master tam.
I, big guts cheung, am no fool.

168
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:18,107
Once you tell me something,
I'l remember it forever.

169
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:20,292
You needn't tell me again.

170
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:25,051
You know I'm a rich and respectable man,
and now I'm running for mayor.

171
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,635
If people knew of these affairs,

172
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,846
it would have a major impact
on my reputation.

173
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:31,057
Yeah, a major impact.

174
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,435
As long as you're smart,
I won't treat you shabbily.

175
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:35,519
Sure.

176
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,897
Oh yeah, master tam.
I don't understand.

177
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,107
A rich and powerful man like you
can have any woman.

178
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,727
Name her, she's yours.
Why go to all this trouble?

179
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,855
I'm a squire, to say the least.

180
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:48,362
There are things you don't want
people to know or see.

181
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:51,861
What's more, the flowers at home aren't
as fragrant as the ones in the wild.

182
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:54,034
I agree with that sentiment.

183
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,536
We're here.

184
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:02,835
Be careful, master tam.

185
00:14:04,177 --> 00:14:07,135
I'll come pick you up
in one stick of incense's time.

186
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,337
Master tam, please...

187
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:13,682
Smoothest of the smooth tofu pudding!

188
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,139
Hey.

189
00:14:15,188 --> 00:14:16,582
Uncle fook,
give me a bowl of that smooth.

190
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:18,346
- Coming up.
- Why are you so late today?

191
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,060
I'm waiting for master tam.

192
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:24,481
Hey, the incense's almost burnt out.
Get going or your boss will whine.

193
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,982
Thanks, uncle fook.

194
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:28,068
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

195
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:29,907
- Go on.
- Hurry up.

196
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:34,033
I never thought so many young men
would still be in this line of work.

197
00:14:34,082 --> 00:14:36,243
Oh, what's so bad
about this line of work?

198
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:37,661
We come and go on wheels, yeah?

199
00:14:37,668 --> 00:14:39,374
It's leisurely.
We get a lot of tips, too.

200
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:40,744
- Right?
- Yeah.

201
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,578
Well, it is quite a lot.

202
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:44,588
Here, let me tell you a story.

203
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:45,840
Great...

204
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:48,759
- Old biddy!
- What is it?

205
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:50,962
Go buy some sugar for me.

206
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,326
Aren't you worried
I'll have a bit on the side?

207
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,911
If you've the appetite,
snack all you want!

208
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,766
Hurry up and go!

209
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:02,649
Now, back in the day,
there was a guy in your line of work.

210
00:15:02,777 --> 00:15:04,267
He came and went on a set of wheels.

211
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,986
Everyday he lived his life
to a stick of incense.

212
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,938
It was most leisurely.

213
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:12,867
You lot are squatting here
eating tofu pudding.

214
00:15:12,954 --> 00:15:16,037
He on the other hand
went looking for fresh meat.

215
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,457
One day,
he unexpectedly knocked off early.

216
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:20,833
He got back home and saw...

217
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:22,243
My goodness!

218
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,705
Can you guess what his wife was doing?

219
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,040
What was she doing?

220
00:15:29,387 --> 00:15:30,968
What the hell was she doing?

221
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:32,758
Making love.

222
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,598
His mind was set.

223
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,008
He quit being a coachman,

224
00:15:37,061 --> 00:15:40,553
and with wife in tow
sold tofu pudding instead.

225
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:45,774
That's a true story.

226
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:47,856
You old bastard!

227
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,695
You're dragging up something
that happened decades ago!

228
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:51,439
You're telling people I had an affair.

229
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,232
You think you're a big shot?!

230
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:57,286
No, I didn't say you had an affair.

231
00:15:57,331 --> 00:16:00,448
- I only said you were making love.
- You still want to argue?

232
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,957
You said I made love to someone.

233
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:03,355
That means you're saying I had an affair!

234
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:06,416
My goodness, wife! Would I dare?

235
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:08,193
- Even if I had the courage...
- Here's your money.

236
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,208
I wouldn't say that about you!

237
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:12,001
Fine.
Just wait till I get you home!

238
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:14,466
- Quit yelling... get back to work...
- Old bastard!

239
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,724
- Don't bother me!
- Hey!

240
00:16:28,863 --> 00:16:31,650
- Good stuff!
- Yeah...

241
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,489
Good, yeah?

242
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:43,783
What're you peeping at?
Get lost!

243
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:47,461
Open the door...

244
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,507
Hurry!

245
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,543
Be careful.

246
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,101
- Where's that man?
- What man?

247
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:11,811
The man who was in bed with you!

248
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:14,150
The man who was in bed with me?

249
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,863
So you're saying
I'm sleeping with other men, then?!

250
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,375
Here, you take a look.
Look for this other man.

251
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:26,826
I saw him with my own eyes.

252
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,710
Saw him, my backside!

253
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:31,956
Oh, I know
you're no longer satisfied with me.

254
00:17:31,968 --> 00:17:33,549
You want an excuse to divorce me.

255
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,760
Fine! Divorce me!

256
00:17:35,805 --> 00:17:37,636
Huh? Divorce!

257
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:41,424
Here, write the divorce letter...
Write it...

258
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:42,637
I...

259
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,018
You think you're so appealing?

260
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,228
That I like being with you, huh?

261
00:17:46,274 --> 00:17:48,435
I work hard day and night,
so went to take a nap.

262
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,940
And you say I'm sleeping around?!

263
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,819
Oh, you've even got a knife
to chop me up, huh?!

264
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:54,194
Chop me...

265
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,947
You're heartless! Chop me, then!

266
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,834
Whose shoe's this?

267
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:13,210
It's so big, it doesn't fit me.

268
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:14,666
Where's the other one?

269
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:19,963
Because it wouldn't fit,
I exchanged it for you.

270
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:21,676
This shoe's old.

271
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:24,843
When have you had money for new shoes?
You've always worn old ones!

272
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:30,264
See?! You've wronged me
in front of so many people.

273
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,933
How can I ever face anyone again?

274
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:35,106
I don't want to live!
Just kill me! Kill me!

275
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,609
Hey... alright, wife.
Don't be like this.

276
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,611
My goodness!
I won't make it on time.

277
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:41,238
Wife, let's just say I was wrong.

278
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,610
I have to hurry to work now.

279
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:43,953
I'll see you later, then.

280
00:18:44,624 --> 00:18:45,989
You're leaving just like that?!

281
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,657
Don't you go!

282
00:18:47,668 --> 00:18:50,000
My goodness!
What are you all gawking at?

283
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:51,460
Let's go.

284
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:53,917
Makes no sense.
This shoe must be the adulterer's.

285
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:57,049
What do a husband and wife argue about?
The less words the better.

286
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,138
Master, you're looking for me?

287
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:14,559
Are you tired of playing
with fat cheung's wife?

288
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,897
But fat cheung
almost caught me red-handed today.

289
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:20,819
How could that be?

290
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,191
Didn't you ask someone
to keep an eye on big guts cheung?

291
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:26,825
I don't know what
got the lad so riled up today

292
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:29,248
that he would think his wife
was sleeping around,

293
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:31,249
and go home to check.

294
00:19:31,462 --> 00:19:32,622
He didn't see you?

295
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:33,707
Nol

296
00:19:33,714 --> 00:19:36,171
if he saw me,
would I have made it back alive?

297
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,254
However,
he picked up a shoe I left behind.

298
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,385
Pfft! It's no big deal.

299
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,463
There's nothing on the shoe
to identify you.

300
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:47,717
My biggest fear's that his wife
will get spooked again,

301
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,726
and reveal everything.

302
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:53,139
Oh, you can rest easy then.
I can't speak for anyone else,

303
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:57,060
but this woman isn't someone
big guts cheung can handle.

304
00:19:58,114 --> 00:19:59,354
Even so.

305
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:01,571
It doesn't bear thinking about.

306
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:05,158
Master, you mean...?

307
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:10,118
Big guts cheung...

308
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:15,787
However... this type of thing
needs to be done cleanly.

309
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,003
Otherwise, there'll be even more
loose ends to wrap up.

310
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:25,509
Don't tell me you didn't know
that fat cheung's no push-over.

311
00:20:26,142 --> 00:20:27,973
That's right.

312
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:36,516
I know of a friend who's a maoshan master.

313
00:20:36,652 --> 00:20:38,188
You're talking about maoshan sorcery?

314
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,352
That's right.

315
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:41,604
Does that kind of thing actually work?

316
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:45,073
If not, would so many people in this
village believe in maoshan sorcery?

317
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,777
- What's his name?
- His name's chin hoi.

318
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:51,701
This chap's willing to do anything
as long as he's paid.

319
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,788
Daoist master chin, this arrangement...

320
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:58,500
- I've thought about it.
- And...?

321
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,335
I can agree to do it.

322
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,833
- But...
- But what?

323
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:05,302
The altar must be set up at your place.

324
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:06,514
That so?

325
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,302
It's all for safety's sake.

326
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,185
Alright.
I'll leave it all to you.

327
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,846
Daoist hall of daoist master chin

328
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:18,478
come in.

329
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:22,819
Senior.

330
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,355
This is advisor la...

331
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,818
He's my junior.

332
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,817
- That's all for now.
- Fine.

333
00:21:27,828 --> 00:21:29,443
- I'm going.
- Please...

334
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:35,536
Oh, yeah.

335
00:21:35,878 --> 00:21:38,460
Senior, you were in a hurry to find me.
What's the matter?

336
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:41,672
Some guy's offended a rich man.

337
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:44,842
The rich man discussed with me
having said guy bumped off.

338
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,260
Murder?

339
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,146
It's not like
we'd have to get our hands dirty.

340
00:21:49,225 --> 00:21:52,092
We just have to set up an altar
and that'll be that.

341
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:54,969
Senior, the purpose for our learning
maoshan sorcery was to save people.

342
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,728
We've saved so many people.

343
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:59,766
Killing one of them would only be right.

344
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:02,150
Senior,
according to our sect's doctrine...

345
00:22:02,196 --> 00:22:03,686
First taboo: Insatiable greed.

346
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,937
Second taboo: Unscrupulous killing.

347
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,510
Third taboo:
Blasphemy of the three luminaries.

348
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:09,116
- Fourth taboo...
- Nefarious collusion with cronies, right?

349
00:22:09,245 --> 00:22:12,783
Aren't you foolish?
In this world, money is the only truth.

350
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,907
Besides,
master has been dead such a long time.

351
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,208
- Senior, you...
- That's enough...

352
00:22:18,295 --> 00:22:20,536
All you need say
is whether you'll help me.

353
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,332
I'm sorry, senior.

354
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,177
Don't help, then!

355
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,506
But I'm warning you,
don't tell anyone about this.

356
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,259
Otherwise, there'll be no mercy,
even between brothers.

357
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:38,625
Doesn't appreciate my favour.

358
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:40,059
Master, martial uncle, he...

359
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:47,571
Hey, that's big guts cheung.

360
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,656
Go on.

361
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,247
How can you go looking like that?

362
00:22:58,252 --> 00:22:59,867
Change your clothes first.

363
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:02,245
Change quickly! Go on!

364
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:21,514
Excuse Mel!

365
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:32,904
Aren't you big guts cheung?

366
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:34,033
You are...?

367
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,910
It's old dog fa!

368
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:37,738
Old dog fa?

369
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,782
Yeah, that's me.

370
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:42,289
We've even gone out drinking together.

371
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:44,374
- Really?
- Really!

372
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:47,256
Hey, are your guts
still as big as they used to be?

373
00:23:48,010 --> 00:23:51,753
I've now claimed the number two spot,
so nobody dares claim they're number one.

374
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:53,761
I don't believe it.

375
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:56,389
If you don't believe it,
there's nothing I can do.

376
00:23:57,645 --> 00:24:00,057
Hey... now, how about this...?

377
00:24:00,189 --> 00:24:03,352
I bet you ten taels of silver.

378
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,766
- Ten taels of silver?
- Right.

379
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:06,858
What's the bet?

380
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:09,862
The bet's that you spend the night
at the ma family ancestral hall.

381
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:11,989
Spend the night
at the ma ancestral hall?

382
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:14,362
It's as simple as that.
Do you dare?

383
00:24:14,370 --> 00:24:16,656
It's not like I'm facing a firing squad.
I'm all in.

384
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:27,789
- Excuse me.
- Oh, no matter.

385
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,041
My friend...

386
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:34,712
Have we been out drinking together?

387
00:24:34,765 --> 00:24:36,175
Nol

388
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:38,348
then there's no problem.

389
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:44,645
Hey!

390
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:49,234
May I ask
where ma ancestral hall is?

391
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:55,240
Now, pass through the forest,
turn left, and there's a small path.

392
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,571
At the top's ma ancestral hall.

393
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,572
I'm going to ma ancestral hall.

394
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:02,782
Why's he going?

395
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:05,167
Hey...

396
00:25:05,671 --> 00:25:06,856
Why are you going to ma ancestral hall?

397
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,166
- To collect a body.
- Huh? Collect whose body?

398
00:25:09,633 --> 00:25:12,090
Some fat guy's spending the night
at ma ancestral hall.

399
00:25:12,094 --> 00:25:14,801
He's definitely done for.
I'll be collecting his body tomorrow.

400
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,088
I'm going now to check out the location.

401
00:25:17,141 --> 00:25:19,132
Hey, do I count as fat?

402
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:21,557
You don't just count as,
you really are fat!

403
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,060
Hey, then I'm the fat guy!

404
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,520
He's done for!

405
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:30,646
Done for?!

406
00:25:30,696 --> 00:25:32,607
Did old dog fa ask you to come?

407
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:35,572
I don't know any foreign dogs,
Chinese dogs, or mixed-breed dogs.

408
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:38,318
My senior said you're done for
and asked me to collect the body.

409
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:39,906
Your senior, who's that?

410
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:41,557
- A maoshan sorcerer.
- Maoshan sorcery?

411
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,995
Five ghosts carrying wealth
kind of stuff?

412
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:47,914
I don't believe in it.
Now, I'm poor enough.

413
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:50,150
If you can conjure up some silver taels,
I'll believe in it.

414
00:25:50,174 --> 00:25:52,460
If I could do that,
I wouldn't need to work!

415
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:58,634
Now,
I can turn blank paper into hell money.

416
00:25:58,724 --> 00:25:59,839
Then let's see you change it.

417
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,056
Hold this.

418
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:03,183
Watch this.

419
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:09,397
See, one piece, two pieces,

420
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:13,148
three pieces, four pieces,
five pieces.

421
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:17,356
Change!

422
00:26:18,619 --> 00:26:22,077
One, two, three, four, five.

423
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:31,796
One note, two notes,
three notes,

424
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:34,331
four notes, five notes.

425
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,630
That's great!

426
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:45,259
Hey, big brother,
are there any ways to save me?

427
00:26:45,312 --> 00:26:46,973
There aren't any!
You believe me now?

428
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:48,583
You changed blank paper into hell money.

429
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,893
Now I believe everything!

430
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:53,768
Ok, allow me to enlighten you.

431
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:57,488
When at ma ancestral hall,
wait until nightfall.

432
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:59,815
First interval:
Nothing will happen.

433
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:03,653
Second interval:
Climb up onto the tallest beam.

434
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:06,664
No matter what happens,
don't make a sound.

435
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:08,911
Third interval's quiet.

436
00:27:09,044 --> 00:27:11,126
Fourth interval's...

437
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:12,411
What happens then?

438
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,039
You must lie under the coffin.

439
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,957
And the fifth interval?

440
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:20,382
By then it'll be dawn.
At dawn you'll be fine.

441
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,261
I guess so. Let's go.

442
00:27:22,891 --> 00:27:24,552
- I'm not going.
- Why?

443
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,850
You're not going to die,
so why do I have to go?

444
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:28,811
I haven't asked your name.

445
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:31,309
My name's tsui.
I live on the nine miles trail.

446
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,144
If you ever need anything,
come find me.

447
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,151
Remember what I just told you.

448
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,936
Of course, I'll remember.

449
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,233
I hope I've met a noble man.

450
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:41,357
You'd better not be a scoundrel!

451
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:49,373
Hey... big guts cheung!
Are you kidding me?!

452
00:27:49,585 --> 00:27:50,870
You're driving me crazy!

453
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:54,328
Hurry up! Get a move on!

454
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:56,835
- It's getting dark.
- I get it!

455
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,044
Now, go in on your own.

456
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,254
Hey, go on!

457
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:05,964
Get inside!

458
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:09,634
Hey...

459
00:28:14,067 --> 00:28:16,058
It's a while until dark.

460
00:28:16,195 --> 00:28:18,186
I'll find a place to rest first.

461
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:49,554
Master, the cinnabar's ground.

462
00:30:13,312 --> 00:30:14,677
- Fire it up.
- Yes.

463
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,058
The time has come.

464
00:35:15,030 --> 00:35:16,861
Why can't I find him?

465
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:40,486
It's ready.

466
00:36:44,994 --> 00:36:46,200
Water...

467
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:48,035
- All gone.
- All gone?

468
00:36:48,373 --> 00:36:50,739
Daoist master chin,
are you up to this?

469
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,398
Damn! It's daybreak!

470
00:37:59,527 --> 00:38:01,063
I command you: Get back!

471
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:42,063
Big guts cheung...

472
00:38:42,529 --> 00:38:44,269
Maybe he's kicked the bucket?

473
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:46,029
Cheung...

474
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:56,625
Big guts cheung!

475
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:58,787
Here, let's make another bet.

476
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,957
Sleep in there for one more night,
and I'll give you another 50 taels.

477
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:03,442
- 50 taels?
- That's right, 50 taels!

478
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,751
- 50 taels?
- Right!

479
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,251
Great, it's a deal!

480
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,461
See you later, then.

481
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,386
Hey... come back!

482
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,342
Hey... hold on!

483
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:18,478
Shit!

484
00:39:19,065 --> 00:39:21,772
This time my life really is on thin ice!

485
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,900
Oh... it's all good!

486
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:28,233
Now it comes down to whether you've
got enough luck and enough balls!

487
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,358
Enough luck? Enough balls?

488
00:39:31,578 --> 00:39:33,159
What time have you arranged to meet?

489
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:34,235
The hour of the rooster.

490
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:35,654
What time's it now?

491
00:39:35,957 --> 00:39:36,867
The hour of the monkey.

492
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,247
You have one more hour.

493
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,541
In this hour,
see if you can find...

494
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:43,457
A pot of black dog's blood,
four dog paws, and fifty chicken eggs.

495
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:47,336
Remember,
be sure they're chicken eggs!

496
00:39:47,677 --> 00:39:50,635
Boss, please give me fifty chicken eggs.
I'll be back for them later.

497
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:52,341
- Fifty?
- They must be chicken eggs!

498
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,177
- Alright, pick them up later.
- Thanks.

499
00:39:57,687 --> 00:39:59,177
Ten.

500
00:40:00,773 --> 00:40:02,263
Twenty.

501
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:04,891
Thirty.

502
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:09,062
Forty.

503
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:12,190
Oh, damn! Not enough.

504
00:40:13,578 --> 00:40:15,569
Duck eggs

505
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,996
not one less.

506
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,743
Slaughterhouse

507
00:40:32,972 --> 00:40:34,178
Boss, are they ready yet?

508
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,675
All done. Here.

509
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:37,267
Thanks.

510
00:40:37,477 --> 00:40:41,061
First of all,
place everything inside ma ancestral hall.

511
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,388
Everything's settled.

512
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,648
- All done?
- What now?

513
00:40:46,903 --> 00:40:48,859
Where do I sleep tonight?

514
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,440
Tonight,
you sleep on top of the coffin.

515
00:40:53,743 --> 00:40:54,949
You scared?

516
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:58,111
I'm not scared... but I am afraid!

517
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,908
You're in no position to be so afraid!

518
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:04,626
Remember, sleep on top of the coffin,
holding the chicken eggs.

519
00:41:04,671 --> 00:41:10,587
Once it's night's second interval,
the coffin will go "lak"...

520
00:41:10,927 --> 00:41:13,464
When the coffin lid opens,
throw in a chicken egg right away.

521
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:15,970
The coffin lid will then close.

522
00:41:16,099 --> 00:41:17,589
Now, anyway, just remember this:

523
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:20,384
When it opens, throw one in.
You have to use all 50 eggs.

524
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,764
By then,
the sun will almost be up.

525
00:41:23,064 --> 00:41:25,976
Pow! He'll then use all his strength
to throw the coffin lid up.

526
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:30,109
You'll have to pour that pot of black
dog's blood and four dog paws over him.

527
00:41:31,948 --> 00:41:33,404
What a relief!

528
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:37,033
At which point the vampire
won't be able to hurt you anymore.

529
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:38,451
That's seriously bad!

530
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:41,033
Also, I'm leaving here tonight.

531
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:43,160
No matter what,
don't make any more bets.

532
00:41:43,251 --> 00:41:45,082
Where are you going?

533
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,500
If you get the chance,

534
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:49,288
come find me at man fook mortuary
over at ten mile town.

535
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:25,365
How cruel...

536
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:27,875
I'm going to bed first.
You stay here and watch.

537
00:42:27,879 --> 00:42:30,291
Ok... you get some rest first.

538
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,074
What flipped me over?

539
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,157
It makes no sense.

540
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:08,570
Master, are you alright?

541
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:10,033
Piss off!

542
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:15,538
Come onl

543
00:46:38,546 --> 00:46:39,831
Water.

544
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,142
Water.

545
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:04,439
None left.

546
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:15,256
How did you even end up like this?

547
00:48:21,774 --> 00:48:23,435
So what now?

548
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:34,612
Can it work?

549
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:36,948
For surel

550
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:42,871
master tam, that was quick.

551
00:48:42,962 --> 00:48:44,147
I'm a bit worse for wear lately.

552
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,877
Then you need to nourish your body.

553
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:48,255
Once you've taken me home,
you can call it a day.

554
00:48:48,384 --> 00:48:49,669
Thanks, master tam.

555
00:48:50,719 --> 00:48:54,257
You have to be a serious man.
Stop being so immature.

556
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:55,971
You understand?

557
00:49:08,404 --> 00:49:10,861
Just try and get away this time!

558
00:49:19,373 --> 00:49:20,658
Blood?!

559
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:30,255
How come my house's in such a mess?

560
00:49:31,093 --> 00:49:33,175
Wife...

561
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:36,132
Wife!

562
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:39,973
Wife!

563
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:45,137
Out of the way.

564
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:51,481
Chief constable,
I was just looking for you.

565
00:49:51,572 --> 00:49:54,780
You weren't looking for me.
You wanted to cut and run.

566
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:58,488
No,
it looks like my wife's been killed!

567
00:49:58,537 --> 00:50:00,869
Not looks like; Definitely has.

568
00:50:00,998 --> 00:50:03,865
Fatty, where's the body?

569
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:05,746
I couldn't actually find the body.

570
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:08,376
Oh, you got rid of the body
and destroyed the evidence?!

571
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:09,707
Nol

572
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:11,463
where's your proof?

573
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:13,632
Where were you
when the crime was committed?

574
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,838
- I was...
- Say it!

575
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,841
I was at uncle fook's
eating sweet tofu pudding.

576
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:21,265
- Men, bring in uncle fook.
- Yes!

577
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:26,637
Fatty.

578
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,856
See if they match.

579
00:50:36,617 --> 00:50:37,857
It fits?

580
00:50:38,077 --> 00:50:39,567
Fits perfectly.

581
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:42,236
Needless to say,
this is also yours?

582
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:43,954
I guess so.

583
00:50:45,292 --> 00:50:50,286
Fatty, you murdered your wife,
and moved the corpse to the kitchen.

584
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:53,297
You wanted to pull off a 'stash the
corpse under the stove' type deal,

585
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,540
but couldn't manage it.

586
00:50:54,677 --> 00:50:58,090
So you shifted the corpse
through the window.

587
00:50:58,180 --> 00:51:00,762
- I...
- Why did you murder your wife?

588
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:03,591
Hate, fun, love, money?

589
00:51:03,769 --> 00:51:05,600
You only need to
answer with one word.

590
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:08,183
I didn't!
We really loved each other!

591
00:51:08,232 --> 00:51:09,768
We brought witnesses!

592
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:11,811
You speak first.

593
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:13,816
You speak.

594
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:19,149
Chief constable, this couple
fought and argued all day.

595
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:21,742
A few days ago, big guts cheung
even slashed his wife with a knife!

596
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:23,451
- Right!
- A-a-also...

597
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,909
That's enough... get out...

598
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,747
- Did you hear that?
- 1...

599
00:51:27,793 --> 00:51:29,124
Uncle fook's here.

600
00:51:29,545 --> 00:51:31,126
But he's had a stroke.

601
00:51:33,465 --> 00:51:36,047
Your last hope's right there.

602
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:39,589
Uncle fook,
please tell the chief constable

603
00:51:39,722 --> 00:51:42,464
that I went to your place
to eat tofu pudding today!

604
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,256
I...

605
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:48,348
Uncle fook, how could you have a stroke
at a time like this?

606
00:51:48,397 --> 00:51:50,388
If you don't speak up,
I'm a dead man!

607
00:51:50,441 --> 00:51:52,898
Uncle fook, you must talk!
Uncle fook!

608
00:51:54,153 --> 00:51:57,441
Fatty, you're interfering with the witness
and obstructing justice.

609
00:51:57,489 --> 00:51:58,774
I'm not!

610
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,530
You can't talk, can you?

611
00:52:00,618 --> 00:52:02,449
Men, bring a pen and ink.

612
00:52:03,579 --> 00:52:07,868
Now, all you have to do
is write 'yes' or 'no' on the paper.

613
00:52:18,802 --> 00:52:26,802
Yes...

614
00:52:31,857 --> 00:52:33,188
He said you didn't!

615
00:52:33,233 --> 00:52:35,394
The evidence is irrefutable
and you're still denying it?

616
00:52:35,402 --> 00:52:36,733
Men, take him back!

617
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:40,938
I'm innocent!

618
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:06,301
Master tam. Advisor la...

619
00:53:06,350 --> 00:53:08,762
Fat cheung,
how could you do such a thing?

620
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:11,309
Master tam, I'm innocent!

621
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:14,685
When my wife died, I was still waiting
for you at the front of the inn.

622
00:53:16,110 --> 00:53:18,066
I haven't told anyone.

623
00:53:18,821 --> 00:53:22,063
Master tam,
please think of a way to save me.

624
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:25,156
I don't think fat cheung's
that kind of man.

625
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:28,740
Our master's doing what he can
to help you.

626
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:33,457
I've spent a lot of money
to try and help you.

627
00:53:33,502 --> 00:53:35,743
So just be calm and wait.

628
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:37,161
For death!

629
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:39,163
Thank you, master tam.

630
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,081
Alright. We're leaving now.

631
00:53:41,135 --> 00:53:42,420
I'll see you out.

632
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,251
No need.

633
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:45,760
I won't bother, then.

634
00:53:45,848 --> 00:53:47,554
Master tam,
drop by whenever you're free.

635
00:53:57,359 --> 00:53:59,315
Whoa! So plentiful!

636
00:53:59,403 --> 00:54:01,815
Master tam really has his ways.

637
00:54:01,864 --> 00:54:04,822
Fatty, indulge to your
heart's content tonight.

638
00:54:05,159 --> 00:54:07,650
You'll be gone after tomorrow.

639
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:09,610
You're letting me out tomorrow?

640
00:54:09,663 --> 00:54:10,869
We'll let something out.

641
00:54:10,873 --> 00:54:13,285
But it'll be your blood.

642
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:16,370
Boss, what do you mean by that?

643
00:54:17,546 --> 00:54:20,162
You've got such a big head,
your brow's beaded with sweat.

644
00:54:23,177 --> 00:54:24,542
Understand?

645
00:54:25,053 --> 00:54:26,759
Eat up!

646
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,431
Makes no sense.

647
00:54:40,194 --> 00:54:41,525
Makes no sense, at all!

648
00:54:43,238 --> 00:54:45,729
Boss,
did you send it to the wrong cell?

649
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:47,864
It's not the wrong cell.

650
00:54:47,868 --> 00:54:50,405
Are you going to eat it?
If not, I'll take it away.

651
00:54:50,454 --> 00:54:51,864
I won't!

652
00:54:52,039 --> 00:54:54,496
Master tam has spent a lot of money on me.

653
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:56,331
It makes no sense.

654
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:04,464
I'll eat alright!

655
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,262
Yeah, eat till you're full!

656
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:38,750
Give us some...

657
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:44,330
Don't steal... that's mine...

658
00:55:51,223 --> 00:55:53,054
It hurts!

659
00:55:57,104 --> 00:56:01,188
It hurts, hurts like hell.
I'm dying...

660
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:03,397
Hey, he's got a bellyache!

661
00:56:03,527 --> 00:56:04,858
Let him have it.

662
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,311
Best he messes up his guts
and drops dead.

663
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:10,724
That way we won't have to collect his body
from the execution ground tomorrow, right?

664
00:56:22,963 --> 00:56:24,578
Hey, he hasn't had enough.

665
00:56:24,673 --> 00:56:26,334
Let's give him a little more.

666
00:56:28,927 --> 00:56:30,042
Go in.

667
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:34,713
Damn fatty,
destroying public property!

668
00:56:34,766 --> 00:56:37,758
- Beat him good!
- Don't beat me! Don't!

669
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,805
These death row prisoners
are always like this.

670
00:56:39,813 --> 00:56:42,054
- They always need a good beating.
- Beat him up.

671
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:46,938
I wouldn't dare!
Don't hit me! Don't!

672
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:49,444
Don't hit me!

673
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:52,360
I wouldn't dare!

674
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:55,192
He's as good as dead.

675
00:56:55,203 --> 00:56:58,912
- Leaves less work for us to do.
- Yeah, forget those death row inmates.

676
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:01,407
Yeah, tonight we knock off early.

677
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:04,743
- Where are we going to play?
- We'll decide after we knock off.

678
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:40,964
Boss,
I didn't mean to knock over your coffin.

679
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:44,051
I'm sorry...

680
00:58:53,447 --> 00:58:55,438
I don't know who's the unlucky one,
you or me?

681
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:57,064
How fragile is this?

682
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,863
Next time you come across some cash,
don't spend it at this coffin shop!

683
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:07,616
Excuse me.

684
00:59:13,717 --> 00:59:15,799
There's no place to sleep.

685
00:59:17,304 --> 00:59:18,339
Here, old friend,

686
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:20,908
you've got four and a half planks.
Let me borrow one to sleep on.

687
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:22,843
Come daybreak I'm gone.

688
00:59:23,143 --> 00:59:24,553
I'm sorry.

689
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:50,534
How did he escape?

690
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:52,085
Don't ask me.

691
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:54,045
At any rate, we were unlucky.

692
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:56,464
- Then thanks for all your trouble.
- Track him down.

693
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:23,687
Where is he?

694
01:02:23,698 --> 01:02:25,359
He's disappeared.

695
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:19,492
He must've absorbed some of my qi,

696
01:03:19,504 --> 01:03:21,870
so whatever I do,
he does as well.

697
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:53,280
You're shrewder than a ghost!

698
01:03:53,621 --> 01:03:55,236
I'm afraid of you!

699
01:03:55,290 --> 01:03:58,498
Ok! Let's see what you're like
when day breaks.

700
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:50,375
It's like there's wolves to the front
and tigers to the rear!

701
01:04:54,140 --> 01:04:55,425
It's big guts cheung!

702
01:04:57,352 --> 01:04:59,013
He's coming this way.

703
01:04:59,354 --> 01:05:02,061
With me here,
he has nowhere run.

704
01:05:06,486 --> 01:05:07,486
Come on.

705
01:05:09,531 --> 01:05:11,021
He's coming...

706
01:05:11,116 --> 01:05:12,822
Give me the swords!

707
01:05:35,056 --> 01:05:36,546
Men!

708
01:05:38,184 --> 01:05:39,515
Men!

709
01:05:39,602 --> 01:05:40,602
Yes...

710
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:44,271
Hurry up!

711
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:47,683
- Hurry, lift him off!
- Yes...

712
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:49,066
Hurry up!

713
01:05:51,781 --> 01:05:53,487
Burn him!

714
01:06:05,378 --> 01:06:06,288
Are you ok, boss?

715
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:07,452
Of course, I'm alright.
Go after him!

716
01:06:07,464 --> 01:06:08,464
Yes...

717
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:37,656
Whoa! This kind of thing again?!

718
01:06:58,806 --> 01:07:00,046
Big guts cheung?!

719
01:07:03,728 --> 01:07:06,060
Hey, what are you doing here?

720
01:07:06,898 --> 01:07:08,263
I'm in some real hot water.

721
01:07:08,274 --> 01:07:10,811
I've got the bailiffs on my tail.

722
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:13,564
Hey,
is there any place here to hide?

723
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:16,187
I think the bailiffs
will catch up with me soon.

724
01:07:17,951 --> 01:07:19,236
Follow me.

725
01:07:21,246 --> 01:07:23,077
Hey... what are you doing?

726
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:25,033
You're going in the coffin.

727
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:26,740
Hide in the coffin?

728
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:28,165
But the thing inside...?

729
01:07:28,253 --> 01:07:29,493
It's decomposed into nothing.

730
01:07:29,504 --> 01:07:31,119
Hurry up!

731
01:07:32,966 --> 01:07:34,126
Hurry up and lie inside.

732
01:07:34,175 --> 01:07:35,790
Hurry up!

733
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:49,395
This way!

734
01:08:06,416 --> 01:08:07,872
Anyone there?

735
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:10,992
You can't see such a big man sitting here?

736
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:18,875
Have you seen anyone come in here?

737
01:08:20,263 --> 01:08:21,628
Sure!

738
01:08:22,181 --> 01:08:23,466
Where is he?

739
01:08:23,516 --> 01:08:25,347
Right beside me.

740
01:08:28,896 --> 01:08:30,807
I meant before we came in.

741
01:08:30,857 --> 01:08:32,848
Oh, then no.

742
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:37,940
- Search everywhere.
- Yes...

743
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:44,867
- Hey, there...
- Hey...

744
01:08:48,082 --> 01:08:50,368
- Hey, there...
- Anyone there?

745
01:08:50,877 --> 01:08:52,837
We've searched everywhere
and there's no one here.

746
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:02,134
You guys, go and take a look
inside the third coffin.

747
01:09:02,221 --> 01:09:03,427
Yes!

748
01:09:10,688 --> 01:09:12,895
Boss, you should go...

749
01:09:13,566 --> 01:09:15,272
So useless!

750
01:09:27,914 --> 01:09:29,870
That one's been dead for a long time.

751
01:09:29,874 --> 01:09:32,160
It's overgrown with bugs.
My god...

752
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:34,329
It's really disgusting!

753
01:09:35,713 --> 01:09:37,704
Now, think it through carefully.

754
01:09:37,757 --> 01:09:39,918
- Right?
- Yeah...

755
01:10:02,115 --> 01:10:03,776
Whoa!

756
01:10:05,576 --> 01:10:07,942
It's truly disgusting!

757
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:11,863
It's truly disgusting?

758
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:14,574
- I told you...
- Say no more.

759
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:19,579
If you see this fatty,
notify me at the court.

760
01:10:19,632 --> 01:10:20,963
Sure...

761
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:22,423
Let's go.

762
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:36,846
Hey, come out.

763
01:10:38,192 --> 01:10:39,898
- They've gone?
- Yes.

764
01:10:43,823 --> 01:10:45,563
Hey,
what are you going to do now?

765
01:10:45,867 --> 01:10:47,232
I don't know what to do.

766
01:10:47,326 --> 01:10:50,284
How about you stay here and assist me?

767
01:10:52,665 --> 01:10:53,825
That's actually what I meant.

768
01:10:59,464 --> 01:11:00,795
Thank you very much.

769
01:11:01,424 --> 01:11:02,834
- This is for you.
- Thanks.

770
01:11:03,134 --> 01:11:04,590
No need to see me off.

771
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:07,969
Here.

772
01:11:10,141 --> 01:11:11,506
Did you actually murder your wife?

773
01:11:11,517 --> 01:11:13,223
Absolutely not!

774
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:14,329
Do you know who did kill her?

775
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:16,139
Oh, of course I do.

776
01:11:16,981 --> 01:11:18,812
It was the owner of this shoe.

777
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:21,148
- Who's that?
- It's...

778
01:11:22,445 --> 01:11:23,810
I don't know.

779
01:11:24,113 --> 01:11:25,899
Nonsense! Don't talk so much.

780
01:11:25,948 --> 01:11:27,676
I'm as hungry as a ghost.
Let's find a place to eat first.

781
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,691
Good. I'm a bit hungry, too!

782
01:11:38,711 --> 01:11:40,201
What tea would you two like?

783
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:41,502
Pu'er.

784
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:45,935
Here, the water's boiling
and the tea's good.

785
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,799
The dim sum isn't bad either.

786
01:11:54,769 --> 01:11:56,350
This place's speciality is pot rice?

787
01:11:56,354 --> 01:11:58,219
- Yeah, you in?
- Sure!

788
01:11:58,314 --> 01:12:00,020
- Waiter!
- Oh, what can I get you?

789
01:12:00,024 --> 01:12:02,140
- Two pork rib rice.
- Oh, of course.

790
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:04,642
Coming up,
two pork ribs with rice.

791
01:12:04,821 --> 01:12:06,061
How many?

792
01:12:27,218 --> 01:12:29,459
Big guts cheung

793
01:13:05,840 --> 01:13:07,831
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

794
01:13:08,926 --> 01:13:10,291
My pot rice?!

795
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:13,628
What are you doing?

796
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:18,290
- What the hell are you doing?
- I don't know what's going on!

797
01:13:21,272 --> 01:13:22,853
Why's this happening?

798
01:13:34,327 --> 01:13:37,285
How can this be? Could it be...?

799
01:13:56,307 --> 01:13:57,797
It's nothing to do with me!

800
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:24,077
Stop!

801
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:32,173
I'm alright!

802
01:14:39,183 --> 01:14:40,468
You...

803
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:42,554
Senior, you've gone too far!

804
01:14:43,396 --> 01:14:45,102
I am no longer your senior!

805
01:14:45,982 --> 01:14:47,893
Those are your words,
not mine, senior.

806
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:52,648
If you still think of me as your senior,
then don't go against me.

807
01:14:53,072 --> 01:14:55,188
You shouldn't be so quick
to kill an innocent man.

808
01:14:56,242 --> 01:14:58,449
Received their payment,
remove their ailment.

809
01:14:58,494 --> 01:15:00,325
- Senior...
- Spit on you!

810
01:16:28,793 --> 01:16:30,784
Senior,
you will not control him again.

811
01:16:30,836 --> 01:16:32,121
Or else...

812
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:35,045
I won't! T won't!

813
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:40,130
Fine. I'm going.

814
01:16:40,221 --> 01:16:41,221
You...

815
01:16:42,139 --> 01:16:43,549
You beware!

816
01:16:50,898 --> 01:16:52,604
Astrological birth chart?

817
01:16:57,446 --> 01:17:03,863
Sorry...

818
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:06,235
- Let's go!
- That's the fatty who broke everything!

819
01:17:06,372 --> 01:17:07,532
Get lost!

820
01:17:08,874 --> 01:17:11,581
Big guts cheung,
let's see you escape this time.

821
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:14,039
I told you,
I didn't murder my wife!

822
01:17:14,421 --> 01:17:17,163
If you can't bring him in alive...
Bring him in dead.

823
01:17:17,550 --> 01:17:18,550
Gol

824
01:18:47,264 --> 01:18:49,255
No matter what,
you must kill him!

825
01:18:52,269 --> 01:18:55,056
Bailiff

826
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:24,881
Kill him!

827
01:19:29,306 --> 01:19:30,591
Truly useless!

828
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:33,886
Step aside!

829
01:19:40,442 --> 01:19:41,727
What are you doing?

830
01:19:43,070 --> 01:19:44,070
Constable

831
01:19:44,363 --> 01:19:45,603
get him!

832
01:19:58,043 --> 01:19:59,043
How did this happen?

833
01:19:59,086 --> 01:20:00,872
Hey, still standing around?

834
01:20:04,591 --> 01:20:06,673
Have you all
been possessed by evil spirits?

835
01:20:07,761 --> 01:20:10,343
Hey, big guts,
who knows your astrological birth chart?

836
01:20:10,389 --> 01:20:11,674
Astrological birth chart?

837
01:20:11,724 --> 01:20:14,591
Except for my wife and master tam,
no one else knows.

838
01:20:14,601 --> 01:20:16,216
Master tam?

839
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:21,180
He has an advisor named lau?

840
01:20:21,275 --> 01:20:23,061
Yes, how did you know?

841
01:20:23,944 --> 01:20:26,185
Then it must be your boss
who hired someone to kill you.

842
01:20:26,238 --> 01:20:28,445
Master tam? Impossible.

843
01:20:28,490 --> 01:20:29,730
He treats me so well.

844
01:20:29,783 --> 01:20:31,774
Why would he hire someone to kill me?

845
01:20:32,411 --> 01:20:35,824
In this world, there are many people
who appear benevolent,

846
01:20:35,873 --> 01:20:37,329
but harbour evil intentions.

847
01:20:37,416 --> 01:20:41,250
If it wasn't for him, how could my senior
have your astrological birth chart?

848
01:20:44,965 --> 01:20:47,068
- What do we do now?
- Change your clothes, pack up our things.

849
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:49,959
We're going to look for master tam
and get to the bottom of this.

850
01:20:49,970 --> 01:20:51,551
Let's go.

851
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:09,653
Hey... this is just a run down temple.
What are we doing here?

852
01:21:09,823 --> 01:21:11,563
I'm going to cleanse you.

853
01:21:11,617 --> 01:21:15,075
Pfft! Why would I come all this way
just to take a bath?

854
01:21:15,621 --> 01:21:18,283
I'm going to cleanse you,
not bathe you!

855
01:21:18,415 --> 01:21:20,101
I must cleanse you
till only past lives remain.

856
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:23,242
Formally induct you into the dao.
Accept you as my disciple.

857
01:21:23,337 --> 01:21:24,577
Accept me as your disciple?

858
01:21:24,630 --> 01:21:25,836
That's right.

859
01:21:25,964 --> 01:21:28,171
Because my senior's magic power
is greater than mine,

860
01:21:28,175 --> 01:21:30,416
I can't always protect you.

861
01:21:30,552 --> 01:21:33,589
If I'm negligent,
your life can't be guaranteed.

862
01:21:33,639 --> 01:21:35,755
You should've accepted me
as your disciple ages ago!

863
01:21:35,766 --> 01:21:37,256
I should warn you,

864
01:21:37,351 --> 01:21:40,013
once you join my sect,
you can no longer have children.

865
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:42,761
Hey, now! Rein it in for a sec!

866
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:46,895
If we don't act now...
You're dead for sure.

867
01:21:47,194 --> 01:21:50,027
Get a move on!

868
01:21:58,038 --> 01:22:00,780
Daoist master chin,
will it work this time?

869
01:22:01,417 --> 01:22:02,748
Master tam, don't worry!

870
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:04,662
This time,
either he dies or I perish!

871
01:22:07,464 --> 01:22:09,375
Master.

872
01:22:12,803 --> 01:22:14,589
What are you doing out here?

873
01:22:14,972 --> 01:22:19,466
I came out to see
how big guts cheung's going to die.

874
01:22:20,227 --> 01:22:21,830
However you look at it,
he's going to die.

875
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:23,139
Go back inside now.

876
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:24,887
Yes, go back inside.

877
01:22:25,023 --> 01:22:26,308
What's it to do with you?!

878
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:28,056
Big mouth...

879
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:32,735
Master, the hour has come.

880
01:22:34,992 --> 01:22:36,948
Light the candle, raise the altar.

881
01:23:03,395 --> 01:23:05,386
Vastness of heaven,
vastness of earth...

882
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:09,144
Ancestral patriarch shines bright for you,
light reflecting the vastness of heaven.

883
01:23:09,234 --> 01:23:11,976
The body has golden light,
enveloping its entirety.

884
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:15,133
Look without seeing,
listen without hearing.

885
01:23:15,157 --> 01:23:17,117
Encapsulate the world,
nurture a collective heart.

886
01:23:17,493 --> 01:23:19,950
White paper is your face,
coloured paper is your body.

887
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:23,075
Until your awakening, it is but paper.
Upon your awakening, it's divine power.

888
01:23:24,374 --> 01:23:26,490
Open your left ear,
listen to the land of the dead.

889
01:23:27,085 --> 01:23:29,245
Open your right ear,
listen to the world of the living.

890
01:23:30,047 --> 01:23:32,038
Open your mouth and recite the talisman.

891
01:23:32,925 --> 01:23:34,540
Ghosts stricken with terror,
ghouls lose their heads.

892
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:37,167
Vajra manifest,
with haste as though compelled by law.

893
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:52,061
Please, you mustn't move.

894
01:23:52,110 --> 01:23:54,021
My senior's now sending his curses.
Y

895
01:24:11,338 --> 01:24:13,078
You've painted talismans on his body?

896
01:24:54,381 --> 01:24:56,872
Master,
from now on we're of the same people.

897
01:25:05,267 --> 01:25:08,179
It'll be fine.
Now we're of the same people.

898
01:25:09,855 --> 01:25:10,560
How come?

899
01:25:10,606 --> 01:25:13,188
We of maoshan are shabby
and trample the ground.

900
01:25:13,191 --> 01:25:17,184
The shabby never wear pristine clothes,
never keep money overnight.

901
01:25:18,697 --> 01:25:19,652
Why trample the ground, then?

902
01:25:19,698 --> 01:25:21,984
Those who trample the ground
keep divinity by their side,

903
01:25:22,075 --> 01:25:24,487
borrowing divine powers
to attract luck and avoid calamity.

904
01:25:31,793 --> 01:25:33,909
- What are you doing?
- It doesn't work!

905
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:35,918
These things don't happen overnight.

906
01:25:35,922 --> 01:25:38,538
It's going to take at least
seven times seven days.

907
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:40,670
It'll take as long as 49 days?

908
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:42,459
I'll make it through, then?

909
01:25:48,977 --> 01:25:50,183
Put it on.

910
01:25:52,105 --> 01:25:55,065
Does wearing this red dudou mean you
don't worry about being cut by blades?

911
01:25:55,192 --> 01:25:57,023
You still worry,
you just won't die.

912
01:25:57,027 --> 01:25:58,437
Put it on now.

913
01:26:45,242 --> 01:26:47,449
Master, more weird stuff's coming!

914
01:27:27,451 --> 01:27:29,470
Rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, snake,
horse, goat, monkey, rooster, dog, pig.

915
01:27:29,494 --> 01:27:31,075
Good luck, great success!

916
01:27:33,665 --> 01:27:35,326
Wooden sword breaks the seal.

917
01:27:45,802 --> 01:27:47,572
Heavenly spirits, earthly spirits,
demons and ghosts hear my command.

918
01:27:47,596 --> 01:27:48,506
My spoken instructions are clear.

919
01:27:48,555 --> 01:27:51,595
10,000 buddhas' mighty power revealed,
with haste as though compelled by law.

920
01:27:51,975 --> 01:27:53,715
Where did you raise the altar?
Talk!

921
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:56,017
Longevity inn.

922
01:27:57,522 --> 01:27:58,728
Longevity inn?

923
01:27:59,649 --> 01:28:01,230
Daoist master chin, is it done?

924
01:28:01,318 --> 01:28:02,854
My junior broke my spell again.

925
01:28:02,903 --> 01:28:04,063
They're coming here now.

926
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:05,568
Coming here?

927
01:28:05,697 --> 01:28:07,653
Hurry up and think of something.

928
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:11,233
Ask your men to elevate the altar at once.

929
01:28:11,328 --> 01:28:12,488
Did you hear that?

930
01:28:12,579 --> 01:28:15,195
- Ask the men to elevate the altar now.
- Right.

931
01:28:16,416 --> 01:28:17,906
Let's go inside first.

932
01:28:23,215 --> 01:28:25,581
Go inside and get your money...

933
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:29,216
Daoist master chin?

934
01:28:29,596 --> 01:28:32,588
Even if they come now,
there's nothing to fear.

935
01:28:46,988 --> 01:28:49,525
The one named tsui,
if you've arrived then crawl out here!

936
01:28:57,541 --> 01:28:58,906
Master tam!

937
01:28:59,793 --> 01:29:01,533
It really is you!

938
01:29:02,170 --> 01:29:04,331
- Big guts cheung!
- Don't be afraid!

939
01:29:05,465 --> 01:29:08,298
Senior, your altar's pretty tall.

940
01:29:08,385 --> 01:29:09,545
Tall, isn't it?

941
01:29:09,594 --> 01:29:11,880
Have you forgotten that master once said:

942
01:29:11,888 --> 01:29:14,254
With two people
who are more or less evenly matched,

943
01:29:14,266 --> 01:29:17,099
the one with the taller altar
will have the upper hand.

944
01:29:17,143 --> 01:29:19,805
How could I forget master's words?

945
01:29:19,855 --> 01:29:22,312
- Then today you will die.
- Maybe not.

946
01:29:22,315 --> 01:29:24,306
- Big guts cheung, raise the altar.
- Yes!

947
01:29:24,442 --> 01:29:25,932
- Raise the altar.
- Yes!

948
01:29:47,215 --> 01:29:50,048
Senior, my altar
isn't that short either, no?

949
01:29:52,095 --> 01:29:54,006
- Light the incense, raise the altar.
- Yes.

950
01:30:56,868 --> 01:30:58,278
Five thunder palm?

951
01:31:16,763 --> 01:31:18,048
Big guts cheung?!

952
01:31:28,233 --> 01:31:29,643
Inviting the gods?

953
01:31:48,712 --> 01:31:50,898
I invite arhat to the Jade palace,
appear at the altar by emperor's decree.

954
01:31:50,922 --> 01:31:53,109
Invite immortals with mantras and curses,
reveal power to slay dragons and tigers.

955
01:31:53,133 --> 01:31:54,777
Tiger-subduing arhat,
heed my call and come.

956
01:31:54,801 --> 01:31:56,862
Your disciple reveres before the furnace.
May arhat please descend soon.

957
01:31:56,886 --> 01:31:58,966
Divine soldier make haste
as though compelled by law.

958
01:31:59,889 --> 01:32:02,159
Bright sky, spirited earth, god descend
to the altar, reflecting the bright sky.

959
01:32:02,183 --> 01:32:04,954
Monkey king make your presence known,
manifest before the altar. Manifest.

960
01:32:04,978 --> 01:32:07,248
Manifest as clear as the sun and the moon.
With a Sincere heart I invite monkey king.

961
01:32:07,272 --> 01:32:09,352
Divine soldier make haste
as though compelled by law.

962
01:33:48,081 --> 01:33:50,163
You're no match for me.

963
01:33:50,291 --> 01:33:52,577
What do you mean? You big ape!

964
01:33:52,669 --> 01:33:54,785
Everyone knows my kung fu's much better.

965
01:33:54,879 --> 01:33:57,370
Prove it to me!

966
01:33:57,465 --> 01:33:59,171
You'll regret you said that!

967
01:34:19,445 --> 01:34:21,276
Got you! You'd better surrender!

968
01:34:21,364 --> 01:34:24,777
No way! Just watch me!

969
01:35:03,114 --> 01:35:07,574
Want to have another round?

970
01:35:07,869 --> 01:35:09,860
I give up!

971
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:14,076
I wish I'd stayed home.

972
01:35:14,167 --> 01:35:16,158
See what you got me into now?!
I'm leaving!

973
01:35:29,098 --> 01:35:30,634
A red dudou!

974
01:35:51,079 --> 01:35:52,181
Flags, drums, and incense
penetrate the three sanctuaries.

975
01:35:52,205 --> 01:35:54,287
First beat of the drum shakes heaven,
second beat shakes earth.

976
01:35:54,290 --> 01:35:56,435
Bang the gong, heaven and earth move,
light incense to invite Dharma master.

977
01:35:56,459 --> 01:35:58,620
Invite demon-slayer, master lu dong-bin,
sword in hand, to appear before the altar.

978
01:35:58,628 --> 01:36:00,708
Divine soldier make haste
as though compelled by law.

979
01:36:06,302 --> 01:36:07,792
Sharpen the sword!

980
01:36:14,894 --> 01:36:17,039
Haze of incense reflects the cosmos,
burning incense penetrate heavenly gate.

981
01:36:17,063 --> 01:36:19,416
Divine dragon walks the big Dipper,
body clothed in protective red dudou.

982
01:36:19,440 --> 01:36:21,835
Red-tasselled thunderbolt spear, penetrate
heaven, shake earth, ghosts and gods fear.

983
01:36:21,859 --> 01:36:24,441
Above and below, your true form's seen.
I reverently invite red boy to descend.

984
01:36:24,445 --> 01:36:26,525
Divine soldier make haste
as though compelled by law.

985
01:36:34,872 --> 01:36:36,112
Master, what's wrong with you?

986
01:36:36,249 --> 01:36:37,409
Master?

987
01:36:42,338 --> 01:36:45,580
Big mouth...

988
01:37:24,464 --> 01:37:25,544
You little brat!

989
01:37:25,590 --> 01:37:27,376
Same to you!

990
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:04,370
Go to hell!

991
01:38:05,171 --> 01:38:06,661
After you!

992
01:39:09,318 --> 01:39:11,309
I wonder if that shoe's master tam's?

993
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:13,060
Big guts, throw up the shoe!

994
01:39:16,742 --> 01:39:18,949
Not this one,
the one on your back!

995
01:39:52,278 --> 01:39:53,939
What happened to my foot?

996
01:39:55,823 --> 01:39:59,782
Don't...

997
01:42:04,744 --> 01:42:05,950
Master!

998
01:42:06,746 --> 01:42:08,907
Master, are you alright?

999
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:13,329
You try climbing up and falling down,
and see if you're alright?

1000
01:42:15,004 --> 01:42:17,711
Master...

1001
01:42:21,969 --> 01:42:23,379
Master!

1002
01:42:28,726 --> 01:42:30,512
Big guts!

1003
01:42:34,273 --> 01:42:35,888
Are you alright?

1004
01:42:36,067 --> 01:42:37,352
Wife?!

1005
01:42:38,903 --> 01:42:40,063
Wife!

1006
01:42:40,154 --> 01:42:42,361
I'm so scared!

1007
01:42:44,367 --> 01:42:47,279
Your boss wanted to rape me!

1008
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:49,576
I know...

1009
01:42:55,127 --> 01:42:57,038
I know you're a slut!

1010
01:42:58,547 --> 01:43:01,960
You bitch!
