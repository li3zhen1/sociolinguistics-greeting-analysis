1
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:33,333
为下一位选手鼓掌。
你准备好了吗？

2
00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:40.833
你敢吗？
我们安排马。他去了。

3
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,154
完成的？

4
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,416
下一个已经在马上。

5
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:51,333
宝贝，怎么了？
看。

6
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:54,333
我们要回家吗？
- 爸爸呢？

7
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,583
我们要找到他。来。

8
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,958
你在这。

9
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:53,208
吃冰淇淋太热了。
- 但是你在温暖的时候吃它们。

10
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,708
如果你把它们清理干净，
他们没有融化。

11
00:04:58.833 --> 00:05:01,125
但你总是这样做。

12
00:05:02.666 --> 00:05:07,041
首先是冰箱里的冰淇淋
然后养肥。这里。

13
00:05:08.625 --> 00:05:12,000
我不喝。
- 一点点，你喜欢。

14
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,333
那是什么？

15
00:05:42.166 --> 00:05:43.875
警卫。

16
00:05:44.625 --> 00:05:46.416
那是什么？

17
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,875
今天早上来了一个人。

18
00:05:52.625 --> 00:05:54,916
法警？
- 是的。

19
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,208
我不得不付给他 28,733.17 欧元……

20
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:03,375
否则我必须在一个月内
离开我的房子。

21
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:10,750
你有 28,733.17 欧元吗？
- 你怎么看？

22
00:06:11.666 --> 00:06:14,500
我钱包里有 35 欧元。

23
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,583
你丈夫蒂娜呢？
- 不。

24
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,383
对不起。
蒂娜。

25
00:06:25,508 --> 00:06:26,729
萨维诺？

26
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,916
一切都好吗？
- 打扰一下。

27
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,750
您将赶上下一个班次。
- 好的。

28
00:06:31.875 --> 00:06:33.416
对不起。

29
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,916
你好。

30
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,333
她已收到驱逐通知。
- 驱逐？

31
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,166
我们能做点什么吗？

32
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:07,958
28,733 欧元不是猫尿。

33
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11.958
应该按时支付。

34
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,541
我们一直在做我们能做的。

35
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,166
的确。

36
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,500
你快乐吗？

37
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,541
那是错的吗？

38
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,791
我在 17 岁时得到了第一个吻。
我在读高中。

39
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:59,375
他很棒。
我爱他。

40
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,750
住口。即使你是最后一个女孩
在地球上，他不会带走你。

41
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:12,125
我应该马上张开嘴吗？
- 是的。

42
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,208
不，只是在最后。

43
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:19,875
我的表弟慢慢地打开它。
- 你是什么意思？这不是前门。

44
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23.916
我想马上，但不要太多，
因为他还应该做什么？

45
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,125
也许。

46
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,291
别理她
她对此一无所知。

47
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,166
我们去吗？

48
00:08:43.083 --> 00:08:45.541
嘿，咪玛。

49
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,500
再见宝贝。
亲爱的。

50
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:59,124
真可惜，咪玛。

51
00:08:59,249 --> 00:09:01,458
多么浪费。

52
00:09:40.666 --> 00:09:43.958
好纯洁的妈妈...
- 为我们祷告。

53
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:48,000
处女座...
- 为我们祷告。

54
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:51,541
纯洁的母亲...
- 为我们祷告。

55
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:55,541
可爱的妈妈...
- 为我们祷告。

56
00:09:55.666 --> 00:09:59.208
敬佩的妈妈...
- 为我们祷告。

57
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,791
你在这里做什么？

58
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,958
她真的很红

59
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,849
是的。

60
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,166
但是天色越来越暗了。

61
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18.458
那正确吗？
- 是的。

62
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:24,125
机关是不是太阴暗了
对于一个八岁的孩子？

63
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,125
两周后她就十岁了。
21号吧？

64
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,833
是的，21号。

65
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,708
器官很漂亮。
她喜欢它。

66
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,250
这是为了纪念圣母。

67
00:10:38.083 --> 00:10:39.833
和...

68
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,333
我卖野兽
然后我就永远离开了。

69
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,083
你介意吗？
- 自然。

70
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,375
我也是。非常。

71
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,541
你不吃吗？

72
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,500
我已经吃了。

73
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:05,125
教堂里的那个女人是谁，妈妈？

74
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,166
那是...

75
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:12,250
一个迷失的灵魂，一个可怜的女人。

76
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:15,833
她住在村外
并且永远不会来这里。

77
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,250
她也参加了牛仔竞技表演。
- 哦耶？

78
00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:27.625
好好洗脚。也在你的脚趾之间。
你总是在那里留下污垢。

79
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,333
晚安。

80
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,833
晚安宝贝。
- 相信，爸爸。

81
00:11:42.375 --> 00:11:47.541
丢弃。明天就不好了。
- 我带它去上班。

82
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,000
她今天在教堂。

83
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,625
去看她。

84
00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:00,291
你觉得她想要什么吗？
- 她有一张去大陆的票。

85
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:07,750
但她问我是否
可以带到她家。一次。

86
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:11,125
然后这样做。

87
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:15,833
她在附近住了这么久，
如果她想要什么，她就会说出来。

88
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,250
等等，亲爱的。

89
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,500
关门。

90
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06.875
当归？
- 你怀孕了。

91
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,208
荡妇。你是个荡妇。
- 当归。

92
00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:15,500
我知道这不是你的错。

93
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:19,505
我原谅你，但我不能再
照顾好你和你的混蛋。

94
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:23,125
明白了吗，婊子？
快点，出去。

95
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24.833
离开。

96
00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.666
离开。

97
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,000
你在这里。

98
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,500
再见，维多利亚。
我是安洁莉卡

99
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:42.666
它是什么？她为什么这样看我？
- 问好。

100
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:46,625
她会和萨维诺的狗交配。
每只小狗15欧元。

101
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,791
但她被抓住了
被一只流浪狗。你明白吗？

102
00:13:50.916 --> 00:13:53,958
当我找到她时，她非常高兴。

103
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,916
我不能再照顾她了。

104
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,791
我得走了。我得走了。

105
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:04,541
你想保留这个吗？
- 把它放在那个盒子里。

106
00:14:04.666 --> 00:14:06.583
这个？
- 是的。

107
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,750
还有这个。

108
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:15,458
不要碰猫头鹰。
它是神圣的。

109
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,250
她总是和马在一起。
- 维多利亚？

110
00:14:36.083 --> 00:14:38.666
她很听话。
- 非常。

111
00:14:47.833 --> 00:14:50,000
来。

112
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,166
最后一次。

113
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,666
做得好。

114
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,041
我的宝贝。

115
00:15:43.708 --> 00:15:45,125
贾科米诺。

116
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47.958
我可以吃些腰果吗？

117
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:06,208
腰果到底是什么？

118
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,125
弯曲的坚果？

119
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,208
猴。

120
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:14,708
学校的老师叫我猴子。

121
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,416
所以我是猴子。

122
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:22,291
之后大家都叫我猴子。

123
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:28,166
妈妈，告诉老师...

124
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,554
...坟墓包含许多碎片。

125
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:34,083
如果我们从后面...
- 孔太窄。

126
00:16:34.208 --> 00:16:37.083
是的，但是有东西...
- 它太紧。

127
00:16:37.208 --> 00:16:40.875
它可以带来很多钱。
- 让我们去那里。

128
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,250
多少钱？

129
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:47.458
超过 28,733 欧元？
- 多得多。

130
00:16:48.666 --> 00:16:51,666
但是要进去
你一定是个口水。

131
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,208
一个刀片。
- 尼古拉斯。

132
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,708
什么是腰果？
- 腰果。

133
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:05,833
我喜欢你，因为你说的那些话
像他们那样。给我买一杯。

134
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:09,416
回家。你受够了。
- 我还得付钱。

135
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:14,458
你知道我马上就要走了。
我离开了房子和一切。

136
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:19,125
想我一会儿，
你再也见不到我了。

137
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,041
善待。
请我喝一杯。

138
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:28.833
最后，然后你去。
- 贾科米诺，尼古拉为我付钱。

139
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:34,166
尼古拉的屁股，
我们需要谈谈这个。

140
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,208
狗。

141
00:20:08.625 --> 00:20:11.083
狗，那就来吧。

142
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,250
我的小荡妇回来了。

143
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33.625
你想要冰淇淋吗？

144
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,875
出色地？

145
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:00,958
这只狗的名字叫Luciana，
就像我妈妈一样。

146
00:21:01.083 --> 00:21:03,708
她是个婊子，就像所有的母亲一样。

147
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:14,208
这很伤人。
- 我该怎么办，女士？

148
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:19,791
你没看到我流血到死吗？
把水放进去。

149
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:33,458
你没那么聪明吧？

150
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,750
我喜欢“夫人”。

151
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,375
赶快。

152
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,666
还没有乳头？

153
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,250
来，帮帮我。

154
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,166
清理。

155
00:22:21.083 --> 00:22:23,041
你有什么小手。

156
00:22:23.958 --> 00:22:26.541
你有多高？
- 我不知道。

157
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:29,791
最后一次是三十四英尺。

158
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33.625
你有多重？
- 25 磅。

159
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:37,708
你是个聪明人。

160
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:40,333
你跑过吗？

161
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:46.083
你看起来像个洋娃娃
在英式饼干罐上...

162
00:22:46.208 --> 00:22:50.083
他们卖的那些黄油曲奇
在有钱人的超市里。

163
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:52,583
你喜欢那些饼干吗？

164
00:22:53.291 --> 00:22:58,416
妈妈说你的脚趾必须很好
洗，因为那是污垢会沉淀的地方。

165
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:02,000
污垢无处不在
你什么也不做。

166
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:19,166
下次我们去
到一个美丽的地方。

167
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:22.916
这是美丽而出乎意料的。

168
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:28,541
当我邀请你去海边时，我没有
期待我的梦想成真。

169
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:32,916
我一直爱着你
我们必须撒谎也没关系。

170
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:40.625
亲爱的，我想回到开始的地方，
不用害怕。

171
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,041
女士。

172
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47.958
它是什么？

173
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:52,541
我不想下去。
我害怕空虚。

174
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:55,750
你说的“害怕空虚”是什么意思？

175
00:24:55.875 --> 00:25:01.250
你没看到虚空中什么都没有吗？
没有什么好害怕的。

176
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,166
来。

177
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:12,291
就一个人回去吧。
天。

178
00:25:18.083 --> 00:25:19.958
女士。

179
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:34,333
亲爱的？

180
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:43,833
它是什么？

181
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:50,750
发生了什么事吗？一切都顺利吗？
- 很高兴见到你。

182
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:54,083
而我，你，宝贝。

183
00:26:54.208 --> 00:26:57.625
妈妈会做肉丸吗？
- 你不累吗？

184
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:02,375
那不重要。你帮我吗？
然后我们准备好了。

185
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:06,208
爸爸不在家吗？

186
00:27:27.875 --> 00:27:31,041
爸爸，我出生的时候你在吗？

187
00:27:31,791 --> 00:27:33,583
没有心肝宝贝。

188
00:28:44.666 --> 00:28:47.541
我们亲吻了对方

189
00:28:47.666 --> 00:28:51,291
它仍然坚持

190
00:28:52.458 --> 00:28:57,000
放下这份爱

191
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:06,166
总是冒险
回到你身边

192
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:09,958
但我不害怕
我是色情之王

193
00:29:12.416 --> 00:29:15,750
没有王冠的国王
但有抽动

194
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:19,666
会出击的国王
如果你拒绝他

195
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,166
所以表现出胆量然后走开

196
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:30,583
因为如果你留下
你让事情变得更糟了吗

197
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:36,000
再爱一次

198
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:41,666
就像我们没有

199
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:46,541
放手

200
00:29:47.083 --> 00:29:49.833
这份爱

201
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:30,458
你去过超蒙特吗？

202
00:31:30,583 --> 00:31:32,125
什么？

203
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:36,833
你去过超蒙特吗？
我以为你不喜欢山。

204
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:39,000
那是真实的。

205
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:42,208
我没有去过Supramonte。

206
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,000
我觉得很可怕。

207
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:50,541
多么奇怪。

208
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:56,166
我敢肯定我最近在那里看到了维多利亚。
- 维多利亚？

209
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:03,750
我以为你在她身后走。

210
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:09,166
但你当时确实有转变。
- 是的。

211
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:17,750
不是维多利亚。
- 我发誓我做到了。

212
00:32:17.875 --> 00:32:21.625
很多女孩都没有这样的头发。

213
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,125
真的是维多利亚。

214
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,875
现在你是一个美丽的女人。

215
00:32:57,833 --> 00:33:02,333
抓紧。你知道吗
我们怎么处理一匹瘸腿的马？

216
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:05,500
不。
- 我们会在他的头上放一颗子弹。

217
00:33:05.625 --> 00:33:11.041
如果他跛脚，那是你的错
我向你开枪。

218
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:14,708
只是在开玩笑。
我什至没有枪。

219
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:21,625
蒂娜喜欢你吗？
- 一点。

220
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,625
真正的？
然后她说了什么？

221
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:26,958
没有什么。

222
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:34,250
维多利亚？

223
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,458
维多利亚在哪里，妈妈？

224
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:42,875
她写道，她和马塞拉在一起。

225
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,083
在马塞拉？

226
00:33:47.458 --> 00:33:51.541
真可爱。
她甚至画了一颗心。

227
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:57,916
她最近去旅行了。

228
00:33:58.041 --> 00:34:01.083
你怎么什么都没说？

229
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:53,499
来吧，马。

230
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:47.083
你要对我的小马做什么？
- 你怎么看？

231
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:50,333
你卖的很好，对吧？

232
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:54,041
来，拿去。

233
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,750
拿着这个。

234
00:35:56.875 --> 00:35:58,708
该死。

235
00:35:58.833 --> 00:36:02.583
逝者安息，
生者关心。

236
00:36:12.916 --> 00:36:14,791
再见，宝贝。

237
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,708
进来。

238
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:22,041
快一点。

239
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:28.625
你到底要去哪里？
我再从你那里得到 200 欧元。

240
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:32,125
你还是明白的。
- 200 欧元。

241
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:35,250
穿上衣服。

242
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:39,666
现在我欠那个混蛋200美元。

243
00:36:39,791 --> 00:36:43,375
他们是我的小马，混蛋。

244
00:36:43.916 --> 00:36:47.541
那是我的房子，混蛋。
然而？

245
00:36:47.666 --> 00:36:49,750
是的，橡子。
- 嘿。

246
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52.625
不要那么粗鲁，你。

247
00:36:53.416 --> 00:36:57.541
我不能看你。
我从你那里得到 200 欧元，女孩。

248
00:36:57,666 --> 00:36:59,500
清除？

249
00:37:17.833 --> 00:37:19.291
它是什么？

250
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:24,583
看看你有没有天使皮肤。
- 我没有。

251
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:33,833
你不被允许撒谎。

252
00:37:42.666 --> 00:37:44.208
出来。

253
00:37:49,541 --> 00:37:51,416
我自己做。

254
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:03,541
把那些戒指摘下来。
- 他们对我很好看。我很漂亮。

255
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,708
你今天从奶奶那里得到了吗？
- 是的。

256
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:44,583
给我买一杯。
你保证过。

257
00:38:48.833 --> 00:38:51,458
你又在坚持？

258
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:53,791
你从不感到羞耻吗？

259
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,333
谢谢你。

260
00:39:14,416 --> 00:39:19,083
是我的朋友。他在胡闹。
这是个玩笑，对吧？

261
00:39:19,208 --> 00:39:22,375
蒂娜。蒂娜来了。

262
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:28,416
起初他们不想接吻
然后他们像屁股一样吮吸......

263
00:39:28,541 --> 00:39:32,833
就像他们想吸你一样。
这不就是爱吗？

264
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:39,250
贾科米诺，给我一杯利口酒。
我女朋友付钱。

265
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:43.083
她付钱。
- 是的。

266
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:48,458
贾科米诺不喜欢多说话。

267
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:52,541
你喜欢其他的东西，
是贾科米诺吗？

268
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:58,250
但事后他总是要哭，
因为他的妻子。

269
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:03,625
也许这就是为什么他可以
不爱我。

270
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:07,416
我们在一起会很好的，不是吗？

271
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:14,125
贾科米诺已经和他的妻子在一起 16 年了。

272
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:17,083
我没有反对他的妻子。

273
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:22,083
她对我有意见吗？
- 她是他的妻子。

274
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:27,291
我们应该是朋友
因为我们想要一样。

275
00:40:32,791 --> 00:40:35,208
你再也见不到维多利亚了。

276
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:42.666
为什么我再也见不到她了？
- 我们达成了协议。

277
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:47,541
你答应过会一直帮助我的。
- 我一直都在帮助你。

278
00:40:47.666 --> 00:40:52.166
但是他们把我赶出了我的房子。
- 我对此无能为力。

279
00:40:54,541 --> 00:40:56.875
维多利亚是我的。

280
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:02,250
因为我把她给了你。

281
00:41:03,666 --> 00:41:05,208
的确。

282
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:08,250
你确实把她给了我。

283
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:13,916
这对每个人来说都是最好的。
你知道的。

284
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:16.458
它就是这样儿的。

285
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:22,375
你从来不想要她。

286
00:41:23.708 --> 00:41:25.875
你从来不想要她。

287
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:30,500
她自己来了。

288
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:33,333
她亲自拜访了我。

289
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:37,708
她说你知道
她回来了。

290
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:43,250
她回来了，
因为她喜欢和我在一起。

291
00:41:47.875 --> 00:41:49.333
警卫。

292
00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:54.875
你会为另一个付钱吗？
- 是的。

293
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57.875
她说她会再付一笔。

294
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:02,625
你的票是什么时候买的？

295
00:42:06.083 --> 00:42:07,708
什么时候？

296
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:11,375
仔细听我说。

297
00:42:13.791 --> 00:42:15,750
听。

298
00:42:15,875 --> 00:42:17,708
离开。

299
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:22,208
去一个美丽的地方
别处...

300
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:24,333
一个不错的地方。

301
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,000
你知道该做什么。

302
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:33,166
我说了什么？

303
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:40.625
我必须卖掉这些野兽。
- 是的，全部卖掉。

304
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:44,583
赚点钱
旅行前。

305
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:51,166
我和 Umberto 将永远帮助你。
总是。

306
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:57,375
你能看出我想要给你最好的吗？

307
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,166
是的。

308
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:05,708
你关心我。
- 是的。

309
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:18,208
我送你回家好吗？
- 我没有房子了。

310
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:21,416
他们把我赶出去了。
- 天气。

311
00:43:21,541 --> 00:43:25,708
我欠他们 28,733 欧元。
- 我知道。

312
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,125
我知道。

313
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:39,750
我不想离开。

314
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:42,166
我不想离开。

315
00:43:48.083 --> 00:43:52,500
你要离开这里做什么？什么？
- 我走了。真正的。

316
00:43:53.666 --> 00:43:55.541
我离开。

317
00:43:57,708 --> 00:44:00,708
新生活。

318
00:44:00,833 --> 00:44:03,875
新生活吧？

319
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:11,583
我们为新生活干杯。

320
00:44:44.458 --> 00:44:46,166
玛丽...

321
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:55,458
让这几周很快过去。

322
00:44:56,625 --> 00:44:59,666
让一切回到从前的样子。

323
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:02,625
让一切回到从前的样子。

324
00:46:14,791 --> 00:46:18.458
加油，妈妈在看着你。

325
00:46:24,291 --> 00:46:26,333
再见，蒂娜。
- 你好。

326
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,666
好热啊。

327
00:47:31,541 --> 00:47:34,416
安吉丽卡，你在睡觉吗？

328
00:47:34,541 --> 00:47:39,000
你会关注这样的事情吗？
来吧，我们在钓鱼。

329
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:12.708
向安吉莉卡展示它是如何完成的。

330
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:22,041
来吧，已经很晚了。赶快。

331
00:48:47.458 --> 00:48:49.833
来吧，快一点。

332
00:49:05.083 --> 00:49:09,041
来吧。请快点。

333
00:49:11,541 --> 00:49:15,750
你现在在这里工作吗？
- 我在 Savino 工作了几天。

334
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:20,208
我不想卖掉我的小马。

335
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,125
你说你要走了。

336
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:30,291
你怎么这么不客气？

337
00:49:30,416 --> 00:49:34,041
你答应永远善良。
- 我很不错。

338
00:49:36.083 --> 00:49:38.958
也许我有一个解决方案
在房子前面。

339
00:49:40.958 --> 00:49:42,708
听。

340
00:49:44.669 --> 00:49:46.857
当她晚上移动时，我能感觉到。

341
00:49:46,982 --> 00:49:52,108
九年来我知道每一次咳嗽，
我女儿的流感或流汗。

342
00:49:52,233 --> 00:49:56,198
她知道我一直在她身边。
如果她转身，我会在那里。

343
00:49:56,323 --> 00:49:59,958
她需要那个。
这治愈了她。

344
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:01,958
我祈求你...

345
00:50:02.625 --> 00:50:06.166
为什么一定要给她治病？
她病了吗？

346
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:13,166
你怕她和我一样。

347
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:20,541
蒂娜，你知道，如果她想要那样，她...
- 现在一切都变了。

348
00:50:20.666 --> 00:50:24.875
你明白？我从来没有过她
必须要给她。

349
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,041
绝不。

350
00:50:27.166 --> 00:50:29,041
这是你的错。

351
00:50:29,791 --> 00:50:33,250
你不能把她关在家里。

352
00:50:33,375 --> 00:50:37,208
你为什么不说
她为萨维诺工作？

353
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:39,333
你现在高兴了？

354
00:50:39,708 --> 00:50:42,250
然后说你开心。

355
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:44,791
那我回来陪你睡觉。

356
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:48,708
你一直无法承受
我们一起拥有的东西。

357
00:50:48.833 --> 00:50:51,750
那不是真的。我爱维多利亚。

358
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:55,458
你想要一个长得像你的男孩。

359
00:50:55,583 --> 00:50:58,750
用你丑陋的耳朵和弯曲的鼻子。

360
00:50:58.875 --> 00:51:01,916
你父亲说什么了？
“她不是你的。”

361
00:51:02,708 --> 00:51:04,791
我从没有说过。

362
00:51:04.916 --> 00:51:06.833
我爱维多利亚。

363
00:51:10,291 --> 00:51:13,833
你想惩罚我。
你想要那个。

364
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:22,000
你为什么让我远离？
你像狗一样拴着我。

365
00:51:22,125 --> 00:51:25,458
当你们互相拥抱
并一起交谈。

366
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:29,208
她是不是我的女儿？

367
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:34,250
孩子因此而受苦。我认为
她一定知道她妈妈是谁。

368
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:38,166
你夺走了我的心
并给了她。

369
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:42.625
这不是真的，亲爱的。

370
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:44.867
我们必须给她一些东西。

371
00:51:44,992 --> 00:51:46,413
一切。

372
00:51:46,538 --> 00:51:50,416
我们有 2000 欧元
和维多利亚的钱。

373
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:53,500
你可以卖东西。
- 不。

374
00:51:53.625 --> 00:51:56.250
为什么不？

375
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:59,333
我们不再为维多利亚买单了。

376
00:52:06,041 --> 00:52:10,291
他不会死在地上吗？
- 看起来像这样吗？帮我。

377
00:52:11.291 --> 00:52:12.875
来。

378
00:52:15,833 --> 00:52:17.833
你看见了吗？

379
00:52:18.875 --> 00:52:22.833
小的都是雄性。
这是一个女性。

380
00:52:23,833 --> 00:52:26,125
她真的肿了。

381
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:29,833
当她产卵时，她会改变。

382
00:52:29.958 --> 00:52:34.083
她从上面变黑
肚皮变成银色。

383
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:38,208
晚上雌性来了，
肿了，出水了……

384
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:42,333
他们去海里游泳
然后几天...

385
00:52:42.458 --> 00:52:47.541
到美国附近的广阔海域。
- 大西洋。

386
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:54,333
你是谁？
- 早上好。我钓到了一条鳗鱼。

387
00:52:54,458 --> 00:52:59,791
多么伟大。谁说这是允许的？
- 当归。我给了她10欧元。

388
00:52:59,916 --> 00:53:04,666
你是谁的女儿？
- 她是翁贝托和蒂娜的女儿。

389
00:53:04,791 --> 00:53:06.625
那正确吗？

390
00:53:08,916 --> 00:53:13.625
你要对 Piras 的女儿做什么？
- 来吧，回家吧。

391
00:53:15,333 --> 00:53:17.458
她看起来像你。

392
00:53:18,375 --> 00:53:21,708
听着，鳗鱼的事我很抱歉。

393
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:57,916
当归说他们出生
在海洋中...

394
00:53:58,041 --> 00:54:01,958
然后他们回来
到母亲从哪里来。

395
00:54:02.083 --> 00:54:04.416
真的吗？
- 是的。

396
00:54:05,958 --> 00:54:09,666
这一个也会消失并死去吗？

397
00:54:09,791 --> 00:54:12,083
我认同。她肿了。

398
00:54:12,208 --> 00:54:17,125
她为什么要跑这么远？
她为什么不留在男孩身边？

399
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,750
她不想看吗？

400
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:25,583
都说人是复杂的，
但有时这也适用于自然。

401
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:39,875
我知道它即将结束。

402
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,500
但你不能就这样离开我。

403
00:54:42.625 --> 00:54:46.875
我只能想到我们的吻，
但我现在得走了。对不起。

404
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,125
票，钱。

405
00:55:37,541 --> 00:55:39,000
去吧。

406
00:55:57.083 --> 00:55:59.375
在这里，还有一张票。

407
00:56:12.791 --> 00:56:15,625
你不给我钱吗？

408
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:25,000
告诉维多利亚你想收买我。
告诉她。

409
00:56:42,583 --> 00:56:45,583
告诉她她想收买我。

410
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:58,250
你说那是我们所有的钱？

411
00:56:58,375 --> 00:57:02,958
我们一收到就给她寄更多，
只要她没有看到维多利亚。

412
00:57:03,375 --> 00:57:06,583
她只想要200欧元。
- 但是你说...

413
00:57:06,708 --> 00:57:09,250
没什么好说的。

414
00:57:13.291 --> 00:57:15,250
她不一样。

415
00:57:22,166 --> 00:57:25,000
让我们离开这里。
然后我们离开。

416
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:28,708
我们离开。
- 那你想去哪里？

417
00:57:28.833 --> 00:57:32.583
她总能证明
她是母亲。

418
00:57:52,041 --> 00:57:54,333
来。抱着我。

419
00:58:03.875 --> 00:58:08.875
你必须在里面呼吸。
不是用鼻子，而是在里面。你明白吗？

420
00:58:18.083 --> 00:58:20,916
从内部呼吸。

421
00:58:28,625 --> 00:58:32,125
你有没有像我说的那样呼吸？
- 是的，在里面。

422
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:33,875
做得好。

423
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,291
如果空气较少，请不要害怕。

424
00:58:43,375 --> 00:58:48,250
最美好的东西往往都快死了。
- 你不能唤醒死者。

425
00:58:48,375 --> 00:58:52,791
为什么不？也许他们发现
一个小公司很好。

426
00:58:53,583 --> 00:58:57.083
他们只是骨头。
你不必害怕。

427
00:58:59,375 --> 00:59:03,375
一切都在循环
回到过去的样子。

428
00:59:03.666 --> 00:59:05.083
来。

429
00:59:12.958 --> 00:59:14.833
你在那里看到了吗？

430
00:59:14,958 --> 00:59:17,125
回到那里。

431
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:21,333
那是找到那张图片的地方
那个胖女人。

432
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:26,541
它是如此之小，
但它值得很多钱。

433
00:59:28,166 --> 00:59:31,708
但你是我的亲生母亲，对吧？

434
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,833
或多或少。

435
00:59:43.958 --> 00:59:47.458
你离开我了吗
因为我又丑又傻？

436
00:59:48.875 --> 00:59:50.541
是的。

437
00:59:52.958 --> 00:59:55,041
但它会变得更好。

438
00:59:56,625 --> 00:59:59,166
我可以问你一些事情吗？

439
01:00:01.125 --> 01:00:02.625
那么容易的事。

440
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:05,500
接吻的时候嘴巴怎么办？

441
01:01:10.958 --> 01:01:14,000
我不知道我为什么让你失望
已经离开了。

442
01:01:14,125 --> 01:01:16.083
谁知道。

443
01:01:18,416 --> 01:01:22,375
多年后我回到了村子。
我怀孕了。

444
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:25.875
我参加母亲的葬礼迟到了。

445
01:01:27,541 --> 01:01:30,958
蒂娜刚到
我生的时候。

446
01:01:31.083 --> 01:01:33.625
没有她，我就活不下去。

447
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,916
她帮助我把你带到了这个世界。

448
01:01:42,583 --> 01:01:44,333
你之前是...

449
01:01:45,041 --> 01:01:47,333
你是个东西。

450
01:01:47.458 --> 01:01:49.833
你非常非常小...

451
01:01:49.958 --> 01:01:51,791
和肮脏的。

452
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:58,416
每个人都说我什么都做不好
但是蒂娜一路打扫你。

453
01:01:58,541 --> 01:02:00,708
诸如此类的一切。

454
01:02:03,791 --> 01:02:06,708
这很干净
她真的很想要你。

455
01:02:06.833 --> 01:02:09,916
你可以做很多事情。她撒谎了。
- 不。

456
01:02:12,208 --> 01:02:15,916
你不应该这么说。
你不能那样谈论蒂娜。

457
01:02:16.041 --> 01:02:21.625
而你也撒谎。你说她很开心
你是来看我的，但你不是。

458
01:02:24,125 --> 01:02:25,791
她是个好人。

459
01:02:57,541 --> 01:02:59,500
当归。

460
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:33,375
给我喝点东西。

461
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,708
不，这对你不利。

462
01:03:41.375 --> 01:03:42.958
来吧。

463
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:51,333
只有这个。好的？

464
01:03:55,541 --> 01:03:57,333
足够的。停止。

465
01:04:02.375 --> 01:04:04,708
你告诉她了吗？

466
01:04:06,791 --> 01:04:09,166
你告诉过我。

467
01:04:16.375 --> 01:04:18.875
你不明白。

468
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,916
她不像以前那样看着我。

469
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:34,333
晚上我爱她
离我这么近。

470
01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:37.875
我闻到了她的小脚丫。

471
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:43,125
她不会有事。

472
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:46,458
现在我不能再拥抱她了。

473
01:04:47.666 --> 01:04:50,750
为什么？
你为什么要这样对我？

474
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:53,833
你为什么要这样对我？

475
01:04:59,791 --> 01:05:02,500
冷静下来。

476
01:05:02.625 --> 01:05:04.625
安静的。

477
01:05:07,708 --> 01:05:09,916
为什么？
- 安静的。

478
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:15,875
她可能比我们两个更好。

479
01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:22.750
为什么？

480
01:05:27,416 --> 01:05:29,666
她自己说的。

481
01:05:36,166 --> 01:05:38,458
我恨你。

482
01:05:42,708 --> 01:05:44,708
我恨你。

483
01:05:44.833 --> 01:05:46.750
你听到我了吗？

484
01:08:08,708 --> 01:08:11.833
你带钱吗？

485
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,166
今天是星期几？

486
01:08:17.291 --> 01:08:20.541
什么？
- 今天是星期几？

487
01:08:22.166 --> 01:08:23.958
20 日。

488
01:08:24.458 --> 01:08:26.458
哦，是的，确实是20号。

489
01:09:36,124 --> 01:09:38,208
慢慢地。

490
01:09:55.083 --> 01:09:57.083
看着她。

491
01:09:57,208 --> 01:10:00,374
酒驳船。
一个可怜的妓女。

492
01:10:00,749 --> 01:10:03,291
不，维多利亚。
- 让她走。

493
01:10:03.416 --> 01:10:05,791
把那个孩子带走。
- 不要碰她。

494
01:10:05,916 --> 01:10:09,791
保持冷静。停止。离开。

495
01:10:09,916 --> 01:10:13,958
维多利亚，你伤到自己了吗？
- 你疯了。不安。

496
01:10:14,999 --> 01:10:16,541
该死。

497
01:10:16,666 --> 01:10:18,208
佛朗哥。

498
01:10:19.958 --> 01:10:22.208
回家。
跟我来。

499
01:10:22,333 --> 01:10:25,375
来。
- 我不和你一起去。

500
01:10:26,583 --> 01:10:30,083
你为什么把她带到这里来？
- 你买了我。

501
01:10:30,208 --> 01:10:33,041
你不在乎我或我想要什么。

502
01:10:33,166 --> 01:10:37,333
你恨我，因为我不像你。
你不关心我。

503
01:10:37,458 --> 01:10:40,269
我不恨你。我...

504
01:10:40.394 --> 01:10:42,750
我真的很爱你。
- 不要碰我。

505
01:10:42,875 --> 01:10:45,541
回家。
- 也不要碰她。

506
01:10:45.666 --> 01:10:48.875
说谎者。
- 你是我的全部。跟我来。

507
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,666
来。

508
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:55,333
离开。

509
01:10:57,291 --> 01:10:59,041
离开。

510
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:26,458
他伤害你了吗？

511
01:11:26,583 --> 01:11:28,166
发誓。
- 我发誓。

512
01:11:28,291 --> 01:11:30,500
你的膝盖？

513
01:11:32,666 --> 01:11:34,750
他不坏。

514
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:39.083
他很兴奋，
因为他真的很想要我。

515
01:11:40,083 --> 01:11:41,750
他是...

516
01:11:43,708 --> 01:11:46,250
我的未婚妻。

517
01:11:48.208 --> 01:11:51,833
你把他送走了。

518
01:11:54.666 --> 01:11:57.875
我现在在这里。
回家吧，妈妈。

519
01:12:13,541 --> 01:12:15,666
佛朗哥。

520
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:27,833
没那么近。我很臭。

521
01:13:02,166 --> 01:13:05,250
对不起，如果你在我身边
做了一些愚蠢的事情。

522
01:14:03,666 --> 01:14:06,916
你必须吃早餐和东西。

523
01:14:10,083 --> 01:14:14,416
我家里没有太多东西
因为我几乎从不吃早餐。

524
01:14:16,708 --> 01:14:18,416
等一等。

525
01:14:21,333 --> 01:14:23,125
这里。

526
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:26,708
我有这个。
它尝起来像橘子。很好。

527
01:14:27.875 --> 01:14:30,500
你看，它在嗡嗡作响。

528
01:14:40,333 --> 01:14:42,250
来吧，坐在那里。

529
01:14:52,208 --> 01:14:56,000
你不想要这个吗？
这对你有好处。

530
01:15:13,458 --> 01:15:15,208
够了。谢谢你。

531
01:15:15,333 --> 01:15:18,750
不喜欢豆子？
- 是的，非常。谢谢你。

532
01:15:18.875 --> 01:15:21,041
我也是。

533
01:15:34,583 --> 01:15:37,250
请您用餐。
- 你也是。

534
01:16:11.958 --> 01:16:16.541
什么肚子。你的小狗什么时候来？
- 卢西亚娜，出去。

535
01:16:16.666 --> 01:16:19.416
卢西亚娜。卢西亚尼娜。
- 出去。

536
01:16:20,333 --> 01:16:22,250
看，卢西亚娜。

537
01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:29.583
来玩吧，卢西亚娜。

538
01:16:29,708 --> 01:16:32,250
看棍子。来。

539
01:16:41,666 --> 01:16:43,750
看，卢西亚娜。

540
01:16:43,875 --> 01:16:45,750
看。

541
01:16:46.375 --> 01:16:48.875
卢西亚尼娜，来玩吧。

542
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:12,958
我可以打电话给妈妈吗？

543
01:17:16,166 --> 01:17:18,041
是的当然。

544
01:17:18,166 --> 01:17:19,958
在这儿等着。

545
01:17:27.041 --> 01:17:29.083
出去。

546
01:17:29,666 --> 01:17:31,375
这里。

547
01:17:42.666 --> 01:17:46,916
妈妈？
- 维多利亚，你吃了吗？

548
01:17:47.041 --> 01:17:49.916
是的，我已经吃过。

549
01:17:50.041 --> 01:17:53.083
我可以叫你妈妈吗？

550
01:17:53.208 --> 01:17:55.083
反正宝贝。

551
01:17:56.875 --> 01:17:59.750
你看过爱恋的折磨吗？

552
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:05,458
不，我们可以一起看
你什么时候回来。

553
01:18:06,291 --> 01:18:11,041
一切都准备好了。
你的朋友也来了。

554
01:18:11,166 --> 01:18:13,166
没人来。

555
01:18:13.291 --> 01:18:16,125
是的。他们都来了。

556
01:18:18.083 --> 01:18:19,791
维多利亚...

557
01:18:19,916 --> 01:18:22,875
我必须挂断电话。天。
- 亲爱的。

558
01:18:37,291 --> 01:18:40,583
维多利亚在哪里？
- 她会在那里。

559
01:18:40,708 --> 01:18:44,666
她今天十岁吗？
- 是的，你不知道吗？

560
01:18:49,375 --> 01:18:51,458
较高一些。

561
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,875
我不认为她会来。

562
01:19:23,041 --> 01:19:26,708
我把小马绑起来
按照你的要求。

563
01:19:31,125 --> 01:19:32,875
我们去。

564
01:19:42.958 --> 01:19:46,000
我们去哪？
- 嘴巴紧闭。

565
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:50,833
一切都顺利吗？
- 我说闭嘴。

566
01:19:50.958 --> 01:19:53.625
我头疼。

567
01:20:06,333 --> 01:20:08,208
这儿这儿。

568
01:20:11.083 --> 01:20:12.833
这里是。

569
01:20:13.666 --> 01:20:15,833
什么东西在那里？

570
01:20:15,958 --> 01:20:18,375
我不知道。
他们说，宝藏。

571
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:21,625
我们必须进去吗？

572
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:25.875
你进去。
我过不去太小。

573
01:20:28,291 --> 01:20:31,083
我教了你所有你需要知道的。

574
01:20:31.208 --> 01:20:34,833
不要害怕空虚。
屏住呼吸。吸入。

575
01:20:34.958 --> 01:20:38.083
然后你推开并再次出来。

576
01:20:39,291 --> 01:20:40,708
去吧。

577
01:20:40.833 --> 01:20:44.041
有人去过吗？
- 不。

578
01:20:46,458 --> 01:20:48,708
来吧。

579
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:55,927
出色地？

580
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:58,458
它是什么？

581
01:20:59.958 --> 01:21:02,958
它是什么？
你期待什么？

582
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:05,958
进去。

583
01:21:11.458 --> 01:21:15,250
我就是这样。
你不应该对我有任何期望。

584
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:20,166
下雨的时候，我就像大地。
离得越近，沉得越深。

585
01:21:20,291 --> 01:21:24,625
我需要钱。
我一无所有或没有人。清除？

586
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:27,125
我不能失去房子。

587
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:30,708
你没有把小马卖给我。

588
01:21:30,833 --> 01:21:33.958
现在怎么办？
这是你的错。你明白吗？

589
01:21:34,083 --> 01:21:36,958
离开。离开。

590
01:21:37.083 --> 01:21:39.791
去。
蒂娜是对的。

591
01:21:39,916 --> 01:21:45,291
我从没想过你。绝不。你可以
没有什么。你只会发牢骚。哭。

592
01:21:45,416 --> 01:21:49,000
你丑陋、愚蠢和无用。
离开。

593
01:21:49,125 --> 01:21:52,500
你很恶心，我诅咒你。
你们都在撒谎。

594
01:21:52.625 --> 01:21:56,125
离开。
我对你没用。

595
01:21:56.250 --> 01:21:58.666
没用的孩子。

596
01:22:02.625 --> 01:22:05.958
你甚至不能爬进洞里。

597
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,458
我没有你的钱。
- 让我走。

598
01:24:52,583 --> 01:24:56,375
你让我感到恶心，
你的和你他妈的钱。

599
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,583
停下来。

600
01:25:00,041 --> 01:25:01,958
你在做什么？

601
01:25:02.083 --> 01:25:06,125
不，不...
- 你不付钱，所以现在他们是我的了。

602
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:10,500
明白了吗？它们是我的。
- 他们来自维多利亚。远离他们。

603
01:25:10.625 --> 01:25:14.000
明白了吗？远离他们。
- 发布。

604
01:25:14,125 --> 01:25:17,083
她爱他们。

605
01:25:17.208 --> 01:25:19.083
足够的。

606
01:26:59,666 --> 01:27:02,666
发生了什么？
维多利亚。

607
01:27:07.166 --> 01:27:11.083
发生了什么？
维多利亚在哪里？她在哪？

608
01:27:12,250 --> 01:27:15,666
发生了什么？她在哪？

609
01:27:21,333 --> 01:27:25,791
我问她想不想进去
爬行。在墓地。

610
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
打扰一下。

611
01:28:35,708 --> 01:28:40,166
对不起。你见过女孩吗？
一个红头发的女孩。

612
01:28:41,208 --> 01:28:44,750
我的女儿有危险。
- 我不懂你。对不起。

613
01:31:24.958 --> 01:31:26.666
你没有遗漏什么吗？

614
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:31,875
我爬进了最深的洞。
独自的。

615
01:31:32.666 --> 01:31:37.041
做得好。
你总是那么勇敢。

616
01:31:41,333 --> 01:31:43.708
恭喜。

617
01:31:45,416 --> 01:31:48,125
你已经长这么大了。

618
01:31:48.625 --> 01:31:50,541
我的宝贝。

619
01:31:54,416 --> 01:31:56,583
我们在这儿。

620
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:01,750
这很伤人。

621
01:32:11,708 --> 01:32:14,250
警卫。

622
01:32:22,375 --> 01:32:24,791
你爬进去了吗？
- 是的。

623
01:32:24,916 --> 01:32:28,291
我也爬了出来。
什么都没有。

624
01:32:40.541 --> 01:32:42.625
过来。

625
01:32:43.627 --> 01:32:45,041
是水。

626
01:32:45,166 --> 01:32:47,125
它刺痛。
- 是水。

627
01:32:57,250 --> 01:32:59,166
我们走吧。

628
01:33:14,333 --> 01:33:17,000
向前。

1
00:01:29,541 --> 00:01:33,333
A round of applause for the next contestant.
Are you ready?

2
00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:40.833
Do you dare?
We arrange the horse. There he goes.

3
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,154
Finished?

4
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,416
The next one is already on the horse.

5
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:51,333
Baby, what's up?
Look.

6
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:54,333
Are we going home?
- What about daddy?

7
00:02:54,458 --> 00:02:56,583
We're going to find him. come.

8
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:30,958
There you are.

9
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:53,208
It's too hot to get ice cream.
- But you eat them when it's warm.

10
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,708
If you had cleaned them up,
they hadn't melted.

11
00:04:58.833 --> 00:05:01,125
But you always do.

12
00:05:02.666 --> 00:05:07,041
First the ice cream in the freezer
and then fatten. Here.

13
00:05:08.625 --> 00:05:12,000
I do not drink.
- A little, you like it.

14
00:05:36,625 --> 00:05:38,333
What is that?

15
00:05:42.166 --> 00:05:43.875
Guard.

16
00:05:44.625 --> 00:05:46.416
What is that?

17
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:49,875
This morning a guy came by.

18
00:05:52.625 --> 00:05:54,916
A bailiff?
- Yes.

19
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,208
I had to pay him 28,733.17 euros...

20
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:03,375
otherwise i have to in a month
out of my house.

21
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:10,750
Do you have 28,733.17 euros?
- What do you think?

22
00:06:11.666 --> 00:06:14,500
I have 35 euros in my wallet.

23
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:17,583
And your husband, Tina?
- No.

24
00:06:23,166 --> 00:06:25,383
Sorry.
Tina.

25
00:06:25,508 --> 00:06:26,729
Savino?

26
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,916
Everthing okay?
- Excuse me.

27
00:06:29,041 --> 00:06:31,750
You will catch up on the next shift.
- Okay.

28
00:06:31.875 --> 00:06:33.416
Sorry.

29
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:46,916
Hello.

30
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:00,333
She has been given an eviction notice.
- An eviction?

31
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,166
Can we do something?

32
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:07,958
28,733 euros is not cat pee.

33
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11.958
It should have been paid on time.

34
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,541
We've always done what we could.

35
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,166
Indeed.

36
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:22,500
Are you happy?

37
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,541
Is that wrong?

38
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:55,791
I got my first kiss when I was 17.
I was in high school.

39
00:07:55,916 --> 00:07:59,375
He is great.
I love him.

40
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:04,750
Shut up. Even if you were the last girl
on earth, he wouldn't take you.

41
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:12,125
Should I open my mouth right away?
- Yes.

42
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,208
No, only at the end.

43
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:19,875
My cousin opens it slowly.
- How do you mean? It's not a front door.

44
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23.916
I think right away, but not too much,
because what else should he do?

45
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,125
Perhaps.

46
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:31,291
Don't mind her
she knows nothing about it.

47
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:35,166
Shall we go?

48
00:08:43.083 --> 00:08:45.541
Hey, Mimma.

49
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:49,500
Bye, baby.
sweetie.

50
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:59,124
What a shame, Mimma.

51
00:08:59,249 --> 00:09:01,458
What a waste.

52
00:09:40.666 --> 00:09:43.958
Very chaste mother...
- Pray for us.

53
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:48,000
Virgin Mother...
- Pray for us.

54
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:51,541
Immaculate Mother...
- Pray for us.

55
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:55,541
Lovely Mother...
- Pray for us.

56
00:09:55.666 --> 00:09:59.208
Admirable Mother...
- Pray for us.

57
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,791
What are you doing here?

58
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,958
She's really redheaded.

59
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,849
Yes.

60
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:16,166
But it's getting darker.

61
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18.458
Is that right?
- Yes.

62
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:24,125
Isn't the organ too gloomy
for an eight year old?

63
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:28,125
She will be ten in two weeks.
The 21st, right?

64
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,833
Yes, the 21st.

65
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,708
The organ is beautiful.
She loves it.

66
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:36,250
It is in honor of the Virgin.

67
00:10:38.083 --> 00:10:39.833
And...

68
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,333
I sell the beasts
and then I'll be gone for good.

69
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:50,083
Do you mind?
- Naturally.

70
00:10:50,208 --> 00:10:52,375
Me too. Very.

71
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:59,541
Don't you eat?

72
00:10:59,666 --> 00:11:01,500
I already ate.

73
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:05,125
Who was that woman in the church, Mama?

74
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,166
That was...

75
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:12,250
a lost soul, a poor woman.

76
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:15,833
She lives outside the village
and never comes here.

77
00:11:15,958 --> 00:11:19,250
She was also at the rodeo.
- Oh yeah?

78
00:11:21.958 --> 00:11:27.625
Wash your feet well. Also between your toes.
You always leave dirt in there.

79
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,333
Good night.

80
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:34,833
Good night, baby.
- Trust, Dad.

81
00:11:42.375 --> 00:11:47.541
Throw away. It won't be good tomorrow.
- I take it to work.

82
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,000
She was at church today.

83
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,625
To see her.

84
00:11:55,750 --> 00:12:00,291
Do you think she wants something?
- She has a ticket for the mainland.

85
00:12:02,208 --> 00:12:07,750
But she asked if I
could bring to her home. For once.

86
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:11,125
Then do that.

87
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:15,833
She's lived close by for so long,
if she had wanted something, she would have said it.

88
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,250
Wait, honey.

89
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:30,500
Close the door.

90
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:06.875
Angelica?
- You are pregnant.

91
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:10,208
Slut. You're a slut.
- Angelica.

92
00:13:12.458 --> 00:13:15,500
I know it's not your fault.

93
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:19,505
I forgive you but I can't anymore
take care of you and your bastards.

94
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:23,125
Got it, bitch?
Hurry up, get out.

95
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24.833
Away.

96
00:13:24.958 --> 00:13:26.666
Away.

97
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:32,000
You are here.

98
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:37,500
Bye, Victoria.
I'm Angelica.

99
00:13:38,916 --> 00:13:42.666
What is it? Why is she looking at me like that?
- Say hello.

100
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:46,625
She would mate with Savino's dog.
15 euros per puppy.

101
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:50,791
But she gets caught
by a stray dog. Do you understand?

102
00:13:50.916 --> 00:13:53,958
She was so happy when I found her.

103
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:56,916
I can't take care of her anymore.

104
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:59,791
I have to leave. I have to leave.

105
00:14:00,875 --> 00:14:04,541
Do you want to keep this?
- Put it in that box.

106
00:14:04.666 --> 00:14:06.583
This?
- Yes.

107
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:08,750
And this one too.

108
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:15,458
Don't touch the owl.
It is holy.

109
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:32,250
She is always with the horses.
- Victoria?

110
00:14:36.083 --> 00:14:38.666
She is obedient.
- Very.

111
00:14:47.833 --> 00:14:50,000
come.

112
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,166
The last time.

113
00:14:58,250 --> 00:14:59,666
Well done.

114
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,041
My baby.

115
00:15:43.708 --> 00:15:45,125
Giacomino.

116
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47.958
Can I have some cashew nuts?

117
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:06,208
What are cashews anyway?

118
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,125
Bent nuts?

119
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,208
Monkey.

120
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:14,708
The teacher at school called me monkey.

121
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,416
So I was the monkey.

122
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:22,291
After that everyone called me monkey.

123
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:28,166
Mama, tell the teacher...

124
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,554
...the grave contains many pieces.

125
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:34,083
If we go through the back...
- The hole is too narrow.

126
00:16:34.208 --> 00:16:37.083
Yes, but there's stuff...
- It's too tight.

127
00:16:37.208 --> 00:16:40.875
It can bring in a lot of money.
- Let's go there.

128
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,250
How much money?

129
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:47.458
More than 28,733 euros?
- Much more.

130
00:16:48.666 --> 00:16:51,666
But to get in
you must be a spit.

131
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,208
A blade.
- Nicholas.

132
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,708
What are cashew nuts?
- Cashew nuts.

133
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:05,833
I like you because you say the things
as they are. Buy me a drink.

134
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:09,416
Go home. You've had enough.
- I still have to pay.

135
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:14,458
You know I'm leaving soon.
I leave the house and everything behind.

136
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:19,125
Think of me for a moment,
you will never see me again.

137
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:23,041
Be kind.
Treat me to a drink.

138
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:28.833
The last and then you go.
- Giacomino, Nicola pays for me.

139
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:34,166
Nicola's ass,
we need to talk about that.

140
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,208
Dog.

141
00:20:08.625 --> 00:20:11.083
Dog, come then.

142
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,250
My little slut is back.

143
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33.625
Do you want icecream?

144
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,875
Well?

145
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:00,958
The dog's name is Luciana,
just like my mother.

146
00:21:01.083 --> 00:21:03,708
She was a bitch, like all mothers.

147
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:14,208
It hurts so much.
- What should I do, ma'am?

148
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:19,791
Can't you see I'm bleeding to death.
Put water in it.

149
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:33,458
You're not that bright, are you?

150
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,750
I like 'ma'am'.

151
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:45,375
Hurry up.

152
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,666
Don't have tits yet?

153
00:22:05,333 --> 00:22:07,250
Come on, help me.

154
00:22:07,375 --> 00:22:09,166
Clean it up.

155
00:22:21.083 --> 00:22:23,041
What small hands you have.

156
00:22:23.958 --> 00:22:26.541
How tall are you?
- I do not know.

157
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:29,791
The last time thirty-four feet.

158
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:33.625
And how much do you weigh?
- 25 pounds.

159
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:37,708
You are a wit.

160
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:40,333
Do you ever run?

161
00:22:41,750 --> 00:22:46.083
You look like such a doll
on an English biscuit tin...

162
00:22:46.208 --> 00:22:50.083
Those butter cookies they sell
in supermarkets for rich people.

163
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:52,583
Do you like those cookies?

164
00:22:53.291 --> 00:22:58,416
Mama says you have to be good between your toes
wash, because that's where the dirt will settle.

165
00:22:58,541 --> 00:23:02,000
Dirt gets everywhere
and you do nothing about it.

166
00:23:15,833 --> 00:23:19,166
Next time we go
to a beautiful place.

167
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:22.916
It was beautiful and unexpected.

168
00:23:23,041 --> 00:23:28,541
When I invited you to the sea, I didn't
expect my dream to come true.

169
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:32,916
I have always loved you
and it doesn't matter that we have to lie.

170
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:40.625
Darling, I want to go back to where it started,
without being afraid.

171
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,041
Madam.

172
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47.958
What is it?

173
00:24:49,125 --> 00:24:52,541
I don't want to go down.
I'm afraid of the void.

174
00:24:52,666 --> 00:24:55,750
What do you mean by 'afraid of the void'?

175
00:24:55.875 --> 00:25:01.250
Can't you see there's nothing in the void?
There is nothing to be afraid of.

176
00:25:05,250 --> 00:25:07,166
come.

177
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:12,291
Just go back alone.
Day.

178
00:25:18.083 --> 00:25:19.958
Madam.

179
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:34,333
Darling?

180
00:26:42,291 --> 00:26:43,833
What is it?

181
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:50,750
Did something happen? Is everything all right?
- I'm so glad to see you.

182
00:26:51,458 --> 00:26:54,083
And me you, baby.

183
00:26:54.208 --> 00:26:57.625
Will mommy make meatballs?
- Are not you tired?

184
00:26:57,750 --> 00:27:02,375
That does not matter. Do you help me?
Then we're ready.

185
00:27:04,208 --> 00:27:06,208
Is daddy not at home?

186
00:27:27.875 --> 00:27:31,041
Daddy, were you there when I was born?

187
00:27:31,791 --> 00:27:33,583
No darling.

188
00:28:44.666 --> 00:28:47.541
We kissed each other

189
00:28:47.666 --> 00:28:51,291
And it still sticks

190
00:28:52.458 --> 00:28:57,000
Hands off this love

191
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:06,166
It's always adventure
to return to you

192
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:09,958
But I'm not afraid
I am the king of porn

193
00:29:12.416 --> 00:29:15,750
A king without a crown
but with tics

194
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:19,666
A king who will strike
if you reject him

195
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,166
So show guts and go away

196
00:29:26,916 --> 00:29:30,583
'Cause if you stay
do you make it worse

197
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:36,000
Make love one more time

198
00:29:37,541 --> 00:29:41,666
would be like we didn't

199
00:29:43,541 --> 00:29:46,541
hands off

200
00:29:47.083 --> 00:29:49.833
of this love

201
00:31:27,666 --> 00:31:30,458
Have you been to Supramonte?

202
00:31:30,583 --> 00:31:32,125
What?

203
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:36,833
Have you been to Supramonte?
I thought you didn't like mountains.

204
00:31:36,958 --> 00:31:39,000
That is true.

205
00:31:39,125 --> 00:31:42,208
I have not been to Supramonte.

206
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:46,000
I find it scary.

207
00:31:48,958 --> 00:31:50,541
How strange.

208
00:31:51,541 --> 00:31:56,166
I'm sure I saw Vittoria there recently.
- Victoria?

209
00:32:00,625 --> 00:32:03,750
I thought you were walking behind her.

210
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:09,166
But you actually had a shift back then.
- Yes.

211
00:32:14,791 --> 00:32:17,750
It wasn't Victoria.
- I'd swear I did.

212
00:32:17.875 --> 00:32:21.625
So many girls don't have hair like that.

213
00:32:21,750 --> 00:32:24,125
It really was Victoria.

214
00:32:39,750 --> 00:32:42,875
Now you are a beautiful woman.

215
00:32:57,833 --> 00:33:02,333
Hold tight. Do you know
what do we do with a lame horse?

216
00:33:02,458 --> 00:33:05,500
No.
- We'll put a bullet in his head.

217
00:33:05.625 --> 00:33:11.041
If he gets lame, it's your fault
and I shoot you.

218
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:14,708
Just kidding.
I don't even have a gun.

219
00:33:18,208 --> 00:33:21,625
Does Tina like you here?
- A little.

220
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,625
For real?
Then what did she say?

221
00:33:25,333 --> 00:33:26,958
Nothing.

222
00:33:32,791 --> 00:33:34,250
Victoria?

223
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,458
Where's Vittoria, Mom?

224
00:33:39,583 --> 00:33:42,875
She wrote that she is with Marcella.

225
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,083
At Marcella?

226
00:33:47.458 --> 00:33:51.541
How cute.
She even drew a heart.

227
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:57,916
She recently went on a trip.

228
00:33:58.041 --> 00:34:01.083
Why didn't you say anything?

229
00:34:51,291 --> 00:34:53,499
Come on, horse.

230
00:35:42,333 --> 00:35:47.083
What are you going to do with my ponies?
- What do you think?

231
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:50,333
You sold them well, right?

232
00:35:51,166 --> 00:35:54,041
Here, take it.

233
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:56,750
Take this.

234
00:35:56.875 --> 00:35:58,708
damn.

235
00:35:58.833 --> 00:36:02.583
The dead rest,
the living are concerned.

236
00:36:12.916 --> 00:36:14,791
Bye, honey.

237
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,708
Get in.

238
00:36:19,916 --> 00:36:22,041
Come on, hurry up.

239
00:36:23,833 --> 00:36:28.625
Where the hell are you going?
I get another 200 euros from you.

240
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:32,125
You still get that.
- 200 euros.

241
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:35,250
Get the clothes on.

242
00:36:35,625 --> 00:36:39,666
Now I owe that jerk $200.

243
00:36:39,791 --> 00:36:43,375
They're my ponies, jerk.

244
00:36:43.916 --> 00:36:47.541
And that's my house, jerk.
However?

245
00:36:47.666 --> 00:36:49,750
Yes, acorn.
- Hey.

246
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:52.625
Not so rude, you.

247
00:36:53.416 --> 00:36:57.541
I can't look at you.
I get 200 euros from you, girl.

248
00:36:57,666 --> 00:36:59,500
Clear?

249
00:37:17.833 --> 00:37:19.291
What is it?

250
00:37:21,041 --> 00:37:24,583
Let's see if you have angel skin.
- I do not have.

251
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:33,833
You are not allowed to lie.

252
00:37:42.666 --> 00:37:44.208
Come out.

253
00:37:49,541 --> 00:37:51,416
I do it myself.

254
00:37:59,625 --> 00:38:03,541
Take those rings off.
- They look good on me. I am beautiful.

255
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,708
Did you get them from grandma today?
- Yes.

256
00:38:41,125 --> 00:38:44,583
Buy me a drink.
You promised.

257
00:38:48.833 --> 00:38:51,458
Are you insisting again?

258
00:38:51,583 --> 00:38:53,791
Are you never ashamed?

259
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:59,333
Thank you.

260
00:39:14,416 --> 00:39:19,083
It's my friend. He's fooling around.
It's a joke, right?

261
00:39:19,208 --> 00:39:22,375
Tina. Tina is here.

262
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:28,416
At first they don't want to kiss
and then they suck as hard as an ass...

263
00:39:28,541 --> 00:39:32,833
like they want to suck you up.
That's love isn't it?

264
00:39:34,375 --> 00:39:39,250
Giacomino, give me a liqueur.
My girlfriend pays.

265
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:43.083
She pays.
- Yes.

266
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:48,458
Giacomino doesn't like to talk much.

267
00:39:48,583 --> 00:39:52,541
you like other things,
is it Giacomino?

268
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:58,250
But he always has to cry afterwards,
because of his wife.

269
00:40:00,125 --> 00:40:03,625
Maybe that's why he can
don't love me.

270
00:40:03,875 --> 00:40:07,416
We'd be fine together, wouldn't we?

271
00:40:09,125 --> 00:40:14,125
Giacomino has been with his wife for 16 years.

272
00:40:14,250 --> 00:40:17,083
I have nothing against his wife.

273
00:40:17,208 --> 00:40:22,083
Does she have something against me?
- She's his wife.

274
00:40:23,041 --> 00:40:27,291
We should be friends
because we want the same.

275
00:40:32,791 --> 00:40:35,208
You can't see Vittoria anymore.

276
00:40:38,125 --> 00:40:42.666
Why can't I see her anymore?
- We had an agreement.

277
00:40:42,791 --> 00:40:47,541
You promised you would always help me.
- I've always helped you.

278
00:40:47.666 --> 00:40:52.166
But they kicked me out of my house.
- There's nothing I can do about that.

279
00:40:54,541 --> 00:40:56.875
Victoria is mine.

280
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:02,250
Because I gave her to you.

281
00:41:03,666 --> 00:41:05,208
Indeed.

282
00:41:05,333 --> 00:41:08,250
You did indeed give her to me.

283
00:41:09,750 --> 00:41:13,916
That was best for everyone.
You know that.

284
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:16.458
That's the way it is.

285
00:41:19,583 --> 00:41:22,375
You never wanted her.

286
00:41:23.708 --> 00:41:25.875
You never wanted her.

287
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:30,500
She came herself.

288
00:41:30,625 --> 00:41:33,333
She visited me herself.

289
00:41:33,458 --> 00:41:37,708
She said you knew
and she came back.

290
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:43,250
she has come back,
because she likes to be with me.

291
00:41:47.875 --> 00:41:49.333
Guard.

292
00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:54.875
Will you pay for another one?
- Yes.

293
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:57.875
She said she will pay another one.

294
00:42:00,166 --> 00:42:02,625
For when is your ticket?

295
00:42:06.083 --> 00:42:07,708
When?

296
00:42:09,625 --> 00:42:11,375
Listen to me carefully.

297
00:42:13.791 --> 00:42:15,750
Listen.

298
00:42:15,875 --> 00:42:17,708
Go away.

299
00:42:18,291 --> 00:42:22,208
Go to a beautiful place
elsewhere...

300
00:42:22,333 --> 00:42:24,333
a nice place.

301
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:29,000
You know what to do.

302
00:42:30,916 --> 00:42:33,166
What did I say?

303
00:42:36,041 --> 00:42:40.625
I have to sell the beasts.
- Yes, sell them all.

304
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:44,583
Make some money
before the trip.

305
00:42:46,958 --> 00:42:51,166
Me and Umberto will always help you.
Always.

306
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:57,375
Can you see that I want the best for you?

307
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,166
Yes.

308
00:43:03,291 --> 00:43:05,708
You care about me.
- Yes.

309
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:18,208
Shall I take you home?
- I don't have a house anymore.

310
00:43:18,333 --> 00:43:21,416
They kicked me out.
- Weather.

311
00:43:21,541 --> 00:43:25,708
I owe them 28,733 euros.
- I know that.

312
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:31,125
I know.

313
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:39,750
I don't want to leave.

314
00:43:39,875 --> 00:43:42,166
I don't want to leave.

315
00:43:48.083 --> 00:43:52,500
What are you leaving here? What?
- I'm leaving. For real.

316
00:43:53.666 --> 00:43:55.541
I leave.

317
00:43:57,708 --> 00:44:00,708
A new life.

318
00:44:00,833 --> 00:44:03,875
A new life right?

319
00:44:07,291 --> 00:44:11,583
We toast to a new life.

320
00:44:44.458 --> 00:44:46,166
Mary...

321
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:55,458
make these weeks pass quickly.

322
00:44:56,625 --> 00:44:59,666
Get everything back to the way it used to be.

323
00:44:59,791 --> 00:45:02,625
Get everything back to the way it used to be.

324
00:46:14,791 --> 00:46:18.458
Go on, Mama's watching you.

325
00:46:24,291 --> 00:46:26,333
Bye, Tina.
- Hello.

326
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,666
It's so hot.

327
00:47:31,541 --> 00:47:34,416
Angelica, are you sleeping?

328
00:47:34,541 --> 00:47:39,000
Do you keep an eye on things like that?
Come on, we're fishing.

329
00:48:09,875 --> 00:48:12.708
Show Angelica how it's done.

330
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:22,041
Come on, it's already late. Hurry up.

331
00:48:47.458 --> 00:48:49.833
Come on, a little faster.

332
00:49:05.083 --> 00:49:09,041
Come on. Hurry up, please.

333
00:49:11,541 --> 00:49:15,750
Do you work here now?
- I work for Savino for a few days.

334
00:49:17,291 --> 00:49:20,208
I don't want to sell my ponies.

335
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:28,125
You said you were leaving.

336
00:49:28,250 --> 00:49:30,291
Why are you being so unkind?

337
00:49:30,416 --> 00:49:34,041
You promised to always be nice.
- I am nice.

338
00:49:36.083 --> 00:49:38.958
Maybe I have a solution
in front of the house.

339
00:49:40.958 --> 00:49:42,708
Listen.

340
00:49:44.669 --> 00:49:46.857
When she moves at night, I can feel it.

341
00:49:46,982 --> 00:49:52,108
For nine years I've known every cough,
my daughter's flu or drop of sweat.

342
00:49:52,233 --> 00:49:56,198
She knows I'm always there for her.
If she turns around, I'll be there.

343
00:49:56,323 --> 00:49:59,958
She needs that.
That heals her.

344
00:50:00,083 --> 00:50:01,958
I beg you...

345
00:50:02.625 --> 00:50:06.166
Why do you have to heal her?
Is she sick?

346
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:13,166
You're afraid she's just like me.

347
00:50:15,791 --> 00:50:20,541
Tina, you know that if she wants that, she...
- Now everything has changed.

348
00:50:20.666 --> 00:50:24.875
You understand? I never had her
have to take to her.

349
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,041
Never.

350
00:50:27.166 --> 00:50:29,041
It is your fault.

351
00:50:29,791 --> 00:50:33,250
You can't lock her up in the house.

352
00:50:33,375 --> 00:50:37,208
Why didn't you say
that she works for Savino?

353
00:50:37,333 --> 00:50:39,333
Are you happy now?

354
00:50:39,708 --> 00:50:42,250
Then say you're happy.

355
00:50:42,375 --> 00:50:44,791
Then I'll come back to bed with you.

356
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:48,708
You've never been able to bear
what we have together.

357
00:50:48.833 --> 00:50:51,750
That is not true. I love Victoria.

358
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:55,458
You wanted a boy who looked like you.

359
00:50:55,583 --> 00:50:58,750
With your ugly ears and crooked nose.

360
00:50:58.875 --> 00:51:01,916
What did your father say?
"She's not yours."

361
00:51:02,708 --> 00:51:04,791
I never said that.

362
00:51:04.916 --> 00:51:06.833
I love Victoria.

363
00:51:10,291 --> 00:51:13,833
You wanted to punish me.
You wanted that.

364
00:51:17,250 --> 00:51:22,000
Why are you keeping me away?
You keep me on a leash like a dog.

365
00:51:22,125 --> 00:51:25,458
While you hug each other
and talk together.

366
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:29,208
Is she my daughter or not?

367
00:51:29,333 --> 00:51:34,250
The child suffers from this. I think
she must know who her mother is.

368
00:51:34,375 --> 00:51:38,166
you snatched my heart
and given it to her.

369
00:51:39,750 --> 00:51:42.625
That's not true, dear.

370
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:44.867
We have to give her something.

371
00:51:44,992 --> 00:51:46,413
Everything.

372
00:51:46,538 --> 00:51:50,416
We have 2000 euros
and the money for Vittoria.

373
00:51:50,541 --> 00:51:53,500
You can sell something.
- No.

374
00:51:53.625 --> 00:51:56.250
Why not?

375
00:51:56,500 --> 00:51:59,333
We're not paying for Vittoria anymore.

376
00:52:06,041 --> 00:52:10,291
Won't he die on the ground?
- Does it look like this? Help me.

377
00:52:11.291 --> 00:52:12.875
come.

378
00:52:15,833 --> 00:52:17.833
Did you see that?

379
00:52:18.875 --> 00:52:22.833
The little ones are males.
This is a female.

380
00:52:23,833 --> 00:52:26,125
She's really swollen.

381
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:29,833
When she spawns, she changes.

382
00:52:29.958 --> 00:52:34.083
She turns black from above
and the belly turns silver.

383
00:52:34,208 --> 00:52:38,208
At night the females come,
that are swollen, out of the water...

384
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:42,333
they go to the sea and swim
then for days...

385
00:52:42.458 --> 00:52:47.541
to the vast sea off America.
- The Atlantic Ocean.

386
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:54,333
Who are you?
- Good morning. I caught an eel.

387
00:52:54,458 --> 00:52:59,791
How great. And who said that was allowed?
- Angelica. I gave her 10 euros.

388
00:52:59,916 --> 00:53:04,666
Who are you a daughter of?
- She is the daughter of Umberto and Tina.

389
00:53:04,791 --> 00:53:06.625
Is that right?

390
00:53:08,916 --> 00:53:13.625
What are you doing with Piras' daughter?
- Come on, go home.

391
00:53:15,333 --> 00:53:17.458
She looks like you.

392
00:53:18,375 --> 00:53:21,708
Listen, I'm sorry about the eel.

393
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:57,916
Angelica said they are born
in the ocean...

394
00:53:58,041 --> 00:54:01,958
and then they return
to where the mother comes from.

395
00:54:02.083 --> 00:54:04.416
Is that true?
- Yes.

396
00:54:05,958 --> 00:54:09,666
Will this one also go away and die?

397
00:54:09,791 --> 00:54:12,083
I think so. She is swollen.

398
00:54:12,208 --> 00:54:17,125
Why does she have to go so far away?
Why doesn't she stay with the boy?

399
00:54:17,250 --> 00:54:19,750
Doesn't she want to see it?

400
00:54:20,500 --> 00:54:25,583
It is said that man is complicated,
but sometimes that also applies to nature.

401
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:39,875
I knew it was coming to an end.

402
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:42,500
But you can't leave me like this.

403
00:54:42.625 --> 00:54:46.875
I can only think of our kisses,
but I have to go now. Forgive me.

404
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:36,125
The ticket, the money.

405
00:55:37,541 --> 00:55:39,000
Just go.

406
00:55:57.083 --> 00:55:59.375
Here, there is also a ticket.

407
00:56:12.791 --> 00:56:15,625
Won't you pay me?

408
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:25,000
Tell Vittoria you want to buy me off.
Tell her.

409
00:56:42,583 --> 00:56:45,583
Tell her she wants to buy me off.

410
00:56:54,791 --> 00:56:58,250
Did you say that's all our money?

411
00:56:58,375 --> 00:57:02,958
That we'll send her more as soon as we get it,
as long as she doesn't see Vittoria.

412
00:57:03,375 --> 00:57:06,583
She only wanted 200 euros.
- But did you say...

413
00:57:06,708 --> 00:57:09,250
There's nothing to say.

414
00:57:13.291 --> 00:57:15,250
She's different.

415
00:57:22,166 --> 00:57:25,000
Let's get out of here.
Then we leave.

416
00:57:25,500 --> 00:57:28,708
We leave.
- Where do you want to go then?

417
00:57:28.833 --> 00:57:32.583
She can always prove
that she is the mother.

418
00:57:52,041 --> 00:57:54,333
come. Hold me.

419
00:58:03.875 --> 00:58:08.875
You have to breathe inside.
Not with your nose, but inside. Do you understand?

420
00:58:18.083 --> 00:58:20,916
Breathe from within.

421
00:58:28,625 --> 00:58:32,125
Did you breathe like I said?
- Yes, inside.

422
00:58:32,250 --> 00:58:33,875
Well done.

423
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,291
Do not be afraid if there is less air.

424
00:58:43,375 --> 00:58:48,250
The most beautiful things are often almost dead.
- You must not wake the dead.

425
00:58:48,375 --> 00:58:52,791
Why not? Maybe they find
a little company is nice.

426
00:58:53,583 --> 00:58:57.083
They're just bones.
You do not have to be scared.

427
00:58:59,375 --> 00:59:03,375
Everything goes in circles
and go back to how it used to be.

428
00:59:03.666 --> 00:59:05.083
come.

429
00:59:12.958 --> 00:59:14.833
Do you see that there?

430
00:59:14,958 --> 00:59:17,125
Back there.

431
00:59:17,250 --> 00:59:21,333
That's where that image was found
of that fat woman.

432
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:26,541
it's so small,
but it is worth a lot of money.

433
00:59:28,166 --> 00:59:31,708
But you're my real mother, right?

434
00:59:42,000 --> 00:59:43,833
More or less.

435
00:59:43.958 --> 00:59:47.458
did you leave me
because I was ugly and stupid?

436
00:59:48.875 --> 00:59:50.541
Yes.

437
00:59:52.958 --> 00:59:55,041
But it gets better.

438
00:59:56,625 --> 00:59:59,166
May I ask you something?

439
01:00:01.125 --> 01:00:02.625
Something easy then.

440
01:00:02,750 --> 01:00:05,500
What do you do with your mouth when you kiss?

441
01:01:10.958 --> 01:01:14,000
I don't know why I let you down
have left.

442
01:01:14,125 --> 01:01:16.083
Who knows.

443
01:01:18,416 --> 01:01:22,375
I came back to the village after years.
I was pregnant.

444
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:25.875
I was late to my mother's funeral.

445
01:01:27,541 --> 01:01:30,958
Tina just arrived
when I was giving birth.

446
01:01:31.083 --> 01:01:33.625
I wouldn't have survived without her.

447
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,916
She helped me bring you into the world.

448
01:01:42,583 --> 01:01:44,333
You were...

449
01:01:45,041 --> 01:01:47,333
You were something.

450
01:01:47.458 --> 01:01:49.833
You were very, very small...

451
01:01:49.958 --> 01:01:51,791
and dirty.

452
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:58,416
Everyone says I can't do anything right
but Tina cleaned you all the way.

453
01:01:58,541 --> 01:02:00,708
All that sort of thing.

454
01:02:03,791 --> 01:02:06,708
It was clear
that she really wanted you.

455
01:02:06.833 --> 01:02:09,916
You can do a lot. She lies.
- No.

456
01:02:12,208 --> 01:02:15,916
You shouldn't say that.
You can't talk about Tina like that.

457
01:02:16.041 --> 01:02:21.625
And you lie too. You said she was happy
that you came to see me, but you're not.

458
01:02:24,125 --> 01:02:25,791
She's a good person.

459
01:02:57,541 --> 01:02:59,500
Angelica.

460
01:03:31,250 --> 01:03:33,375
Give me something to drink.

461
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,708
No, that's not good for you.

462
01:03:41.375 --> 01:03:42.958
Come on.

463
01:03:48,958 --> 01:03:51,333
Only this. Okay?

464
01:03:55,541 --> 01:03:57,333
Enough. Stop.

465
01:04:02.375 --> 01:04:04,708
Did you tell her?

466
01:04:06,791 --> 01:04:09,166
You told me.

467
01:04:16.375 --> 01:04:18.875
You do not understand.

468
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,916
She doesn't look at me like she used to.

469
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:34,333
I loved her at night
so close to me.

470
01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:37.875
I smelled her little feet.

471
01:04:39,750 --> 01:04:43,125
Nothing would happen to her.

472
01:04:43,250 --> 01:04:46,458
Now I can't hug her anymore.

473
01:04:47.666 --> 01:04:50,750
Why?
Why did you do this to me?

474
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:53,833
Why did you do this to me?

475
01:04:59,791 --> 01:05:02,500
Calm down.

476
01:05:02.625 --> 01:05:04.625
Quiet.

477
01:05:07,708 --> 01:05:09,916
Why?
- Quiet.

478
01:05:12,750 --> 01:05:15,875
She could be better than the two of us.

479
01:05:20.875 --> 01:05:22.750
Why?

480
01:05:27,416 --> 01:05:29,666
She said it herself.

481
01:05:36,166 --> 01:05:38,458
I hate you.

482
01:05:42,708 --> 01:05:44,708
I hate you.

483
01:05:44.833 --> 01:05:46.750
Did you hear me?

484
01:08:08,708 --> 01:08:11.833
Are you bringing the money?

485
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:17,166
What day is today?

486
01:08:17.291 --> 01:08:20.541
What?
- What day is today?

487
01:08:22.166 --> 01:08:23.958
The 20th.

488
01:08:24.458 --> 01:08:26.458
Oh yes, indeed, the 20th.

489
01:09:36,124 --> 01:09:38,208
Slowly.

490
01:09:55.083 --> 01:09:57.083
Look at her.

491
01:09:57,208 --> 01:10:00,374
A booze barge.
A poor whore.

492
01:10:00,749 --> 01:10:03,291
No, Victoria.
- Let her go.

493
01:10:03.416 --> 01:10:05,791
Get that kid away.
- Don't touch her.

494
01:10:05,916 --> 01:10:09,791
Stay calm. Stop. Go away.

495
01:10:09,916 --> 01:10:13,958
Vittoria, did you hurt yourself?
- You're crazy. Disturbed.

496
01:10:14,999 --> 01:10:16,541
damn.

497
01:10:16,666 --> 01:10:18,208
Franco.

498
01:10:19.958 --> 01:10:22.208
Come home.
Come with me.

499
01:10:22,333 --> 01:10:25,375
come.
- I'm not going with you.

500
01:10:26,583 --> 01:10:30,083
Why did you bring her here?
- You bought me.

501
01:10:30,208 --> 01:10:33,041
You don't care about me or what I want.

502
01:10:33,166 --> 01:10:37,333
You hate me because I'm not like you.
You don't care about me.

503
01:10:37,458 --> 01:10:40,269
I don't hate you. I...

504
01:10:40.394 --> 01:10:42,750
I love you so much.
- Don't touch me.

505
01:10:42,875 --> 01:10:45,541
Come home.
- Don't touch her either.

506
01:10:45.666 --> 01:10:48.875
liar.
- You're everything to me. Come with me.

507
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:50,666
come.

508
01:10:53,291 --> 01:10:55,333
Go away.

509
01:10:57,291 --> 01:10:59,041
Go away.

510
01:11:24,333 --> 01:11:26,458
Did he hurt you?

511
01:11:26,583 --> 01:11:28,166
Swear it.
- I swear.

512
01:11:28,291 --> 01:11:30,500
your knees?

513
01:11:32,666 --> 01:11:34,750
He's not bad.

514
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:39.083
he was excited,
because he really wanted me.

515
01:11:40,083 --> 01:11:41,750
He is...

516
01:11:43,708 --> 01:11:46,250
my fiancee.

517
01:11:48.208 --> 01:11:51,833
And you sent him away.

518
01:11:54.666 --> 01:11:57.875
I'm here now.
Come home, Mom.

519
01:12:13,541 --> 01:12:15,666
Franco.

520
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:27,833
Not so close. I stink.

521
01:13:02,166 --> 01:13:05,250
Sorry if you by me
did something stupid.

522
01:14:03,666 --> 01:14:06,916
You have to have breakfast and stuff.

523
01:14:10,083 --> 01:14:14,416
I don't have much in the house
because I hardly ever have breakfast.

524
01:14:16,708 --> 01:14:18,416
Wait a second.

525
01:14:21,333 --> 01:14:23,125
Here.

526
01:14:23,250 --> 01:14:26,708
I have this.
It tastes like orange. It is well.

527
01:14:27.875 --> 01:14:30,500
Look, it's buzzing.

528
01:14:40,333 --> 01:14:42,250
Come on, sit there.

529
01:14:52,208 --> 01:14:56,000
Don't you want this?
It is good for you.

530
01:15:13,458 --> 01:15:15,208
That's enough. Thank you.

531
01:15:15,333 --> 01:15:18,750
Don't like beans?
- Yes, very much. Thank you.

532
01:15:18.875 --> 01:15:21,041
Me too.

533
01:15:34,583 --> 01:15:37,250
Enjoy your meal.
- You too.

534
01:16:11.958 --> 01:16:16.541
What a belly. When are your puppies coming?
- Luciana, get out.

535
01:16:16.666 --> 01:16:19.416
Luciana. Lucianina.
- Get out.

536
01:16:20,333 --> 01:16:22,250
Look, Luciana.

537
01:16:27.208 --> 01:16:29.583
Come play, Luciana.

538
01:16:29,708 --> 01:16:32,250
Look at the stick. come.

539
01:16:41,666 --> 01:16:43,750
Look, Luciana.

540
01:16:43,875 --> 01:16:45,750
Look.

541
01:16:46.375 --> 01:16:48.875
Lucianina, come and play.

542
01:17:10,250 --> 01:17:12,958
Can I call mom?

543
01:17:16,166 --> 01:17:18,041
Yes of course.

544
01:17:18,166 --> 01:17:19,958
Wait here.

545
01:17:27.041 --> 01:17:29.083
Get out.

546
01:17:29,666 --> 01:17:31,375
Here.

547
01:17:42.666 --> 01:17:46,916
Mom?
- Vittoria, have you eaten?

548
01:17:47.041 --> 01:17:49.916
Yes, I have eaten.

549
01:17:50.041 --> 01:17:53.083
Can I call you mommy?

550
01:17:53.208 --> 01:17:55.083
Baby anyway.

551
01:17:56.875 --> 01:17:59.750
Have you watched Tormento d'Amore?

552
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:05,458
No, we can watch it together
when you return.

553
01:18:06,291 --> 01:18:11,041
Everything is ready here.
Your friends are coming too.

554
01:18:11,166 --> 01:18:13,166
Nobody comes.

555
01:18:13.291 --> 01:18:16,125
Yes. They all come.

556
01:18:18.083 --> 01:18:19,791
Victoria...

557
01:18:19,916 --> 01:18:22,875
I have to hang up. Day.
- Darling.

558
01:18:37,291 --> 01:18:40,583
Where is Vittoria?
- She'll be right there.

559
01:18:40,708 --> 01:18:44,666
Will she be ten today?
- Yeah, didn't you know that?

560
01:18:49,375 --> 01:18:51,458
Slightly higher.

561
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:09,875
I don't think she's coming.

562
01:19:23,041 --> 01:19:26,708
I tied up the ponies
as you requested.

563
01:19:31,125 --> 01:19:32,875
We go.

564
01:19:42.958 --> 01:19:46,000
Where are we going?
- Mouth closed.

565
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:50,833
Is everything OK?
- I said shut up.

566
01:19:50.958 --> 01:19:53.625
I have a headache.

567
01:20:06,333 --> 01:20:08,208
Here, here.

568
01:20:11.083 --> 01:20:12.833
Here it is.

569
01:20:13.666 --> 01:20:15,833
What's there?

570
01:20:15,958 --> 01:20:18,375
I do not know.
A treasure, they say.

571
01:20:18,500 --> 01:20:21,625
Do we have to go in there?

572
01:20:21,750 --> 01:20:25.875
You go in.
I can't get through. Too small.

573
01:20:28,291 --> 01:20:31,083
I taught you everything you need to know.

574
01:20:31.208 --> 01:20:34,833
Don't be afraid of the void.
Hold your breath. Breathe in.

575
01:20:34.958 --> 01:20:38.083
Then you push off and come out again.

576
01:20:39,291 --> 01:20:40,708
Just go.

577
01:20:40.833 --> 01:20:44.041
Has anyone ever been in it?
- No.

578
01:20:46,458 --> 01:20:48,708
Come on.

579
01:20:54,500 --> 01:20:55,927
Well?

580
01:20:56,750 --> 01:20:58,458
What is it?

581
01:20:59.958 --> 01:21:02,958
What is it?
What did you expect?

582
01:21:04,500 --> 01:21:05,958
Go in.

583
01:21:11.458 --> 01:21:15,250
That's how I am.
You shouldn't have expected anything from me.

584
01:21:15,375 --> 01:21:20,166
I am like the earth when it rains.
The closer you get, the deeper you sink.

585
01:21:20,291 --> 01:21:24,625
I need money.
I have nothing or nobody. Clear?

586
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:27,125
I can't lose the house.

587
01:21:27,250 --> 01:21:30,708
You didn't sell me the ponies.

588
01:21:30,833 --> 01:21:33.958
And what now?
It is your fault. Do you understand?

589
01:21:34,083 --> 01:21:36,958
Go away. Go away.

590
01:21:37.083 --> 01:21:39.791
go.
Tina is right.

591
01:21:39,916 --> 01:21:45,291
I never wanted you. Never. You can
nothing. You just whine. Cry.

592
01:21:45,416 --> 01:21:49,000
You're ugly, stupid and useless.
Go away.

593
01:21:49,125 --> 01:21:52,500
You are disgusting and I curse you.
You all lie.

594
01:21:52.625 --> 01:21:56,125
Go away.
I have no use for you.

595
01:21:56.250 --> 01:21:58.666
Worthless child.

596
01:22:02.625 --> 01:22:05.958
You can't even crawl into a hole.

597
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,458
I don't have your money.
- Let me go.

598
01:24:52,583 --> 01:24:56,375
You make me sick,
yours and your fucking money.

599
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,583
Stop it.

600
01:25:00,041 --> 01:25:01,958
What are you doing?

601
01:25:02.083 --> 01:25:06,125
No no...
- You don't pay, so now they're mine.

602
01:25:06,250 --> 01:25:10,500
Understood? They're mine.
- They're from Vittoria. Stay away from them.

603
01:25:10.625 --> 01:25:14.000
Understood? Stay away from them.
- Release.

604
01:25:14,125 --> 01:25:17,083
She loves them.

605
01:25:17.208 --> 01:25:19.083
Enough.

606
01:26:59,666 --> 01:27:02,666
What happened?
Victoria.

607
01:27:07.166 --> 01:27:11.083
What happened?
Where is Vittoria? Where is she?

608
01:27:12,250 --> 01:27:15,666
What happened? Where is she?

609
01:27:21,333 --> 01:27:25,791
I asked if she wanted to go in the hole
crawl. In the necropolis.

610
01:28:30,000 --> 01:28:32,000
Excuse me.

611
01:28:35,708 --> 01:28:40,166
Sorry. Have you seen a girl?
A girl with red hair.

612
01:28:41,208 --> 01:28:44,750
My daughter is in danger.
- I do not understand you. Sorry.

613
01:31:24.958 --> 01:31:26.666
Are you not missing anything?

614
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:31,875
I crawled into the deepest hole.
Alone.

615
01:31:32.666 --> 01:31:37.041
Well done.
You are always so brave.

616
01:31:41,333 --> 01:31:43.708
Congratulations.

617
01:31:45,416 --> 01:31:48,125
You've grown so big.

618
01:31:48.625 --> 01:31:50,541
My darling.

619
01:31:54,416 --> 01:31:56,583
We are here.

620
01:31:58,500 --> 01:32:01,750
It hurts so much.

621
01:32:11,708 --> 01:32:14,250
Guard.

622
01:32:22,375 --> 01:32:24,791
Did you crawl in?
- Yes.

623
01:32:24,916 --> 01:32:28,291
I climbed out too.
There was nothing.

624
01:32:40.541 --> 01:32:42.625
Come here.

625
01:32:43.627 --> 01:32:45,041
It's water.

626
01:32:45,166 --> 01:32:47,125
It stings.
- It's water.

627
01:32:57,250 --> 01:32:59,166
Let's go.

628
01:33:14,333 --> 01:33:17,000
forward.
