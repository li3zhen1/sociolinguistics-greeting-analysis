1
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,355
走啊！走啊你，快走嘛！
Go, go soon

2
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,916
摸摸索索你真罗嗦，快走…
Knock if off, go

3
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,752
要死了，老鬼
Disgust, you old bastard

4
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,919
好了，别跟我打手势了 快走嘛！走嘛！
Enough of that, go

5
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,277
别忘了带瓶酒回来喔！
Don't forget to bring some wine

6
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,359
妈，擦屁股
I need a wipe, Mom

7
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:13,630
来
Now

8
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,789
哑叔，你早
Good morning, uncle

9
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,595
快吃啦！
Let's have a bite

10
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,872
哑叔！今天我留一斤白菜给你啊
There are some vegetable for you

11
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,677
阿坤啊！你怎么在这边玩呢？ 赶紧回去
What are you doing here? Go back home

12
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,239
要不然，我告诉你姊姊去
Or I'm going to tell your sister

13
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,268
哑叔，你早
Good morning, uncle

14
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,113
哑叔，哑叔，我也要去
I want to go with you, uncle

15
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,752
哑叔，让我去啦！
Please, uncle

16
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:06,151
这个故事从我看到哑叔的 第一眼就开始了
The story began from my first sight at uncle

17
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,196
那时候，我才两个月大像垃圾一样
I was only two months old like a piece of garbage

18
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,032
被丢在路边
And dropped on the sidewalk

19
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:16,877
理由是什么？没有人能告诉我
Nobody could tell me why

20
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,153
当他把我抱进怀里的时候
When he's holding me in his arms

21
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,760
我就再也不要离开了
I felt that I'd never leave it

22
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,355
因为他让我觉得温暖，安全
because he made me feel so cozy and warm

23
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:30,912
像一个父亲一样可以信赖一辈子
Just like any father to his children

24
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,237
她叫阿美
Her name is Ah-mei

25
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:41,792
收养她的人，妈祖菩萨会保佑你
The gods will protect whoever adopts her

26
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,156
可怜人拜上
From a pitiful person

27
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,831
哑叔生孩子了
Uncle's got a baby

28
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:52,071
哑叔生一个孩子了
Uncle's got a baby

29
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,998
哑叔生一个孩子了
Uncle's got a baby

30
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,078
哑叔生一个孩子了
Uncle's got a baby

31
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,837
哑叔生一个孩子了
Uncle's got a baby

32
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:02,910
我的衣服啦！
That's me my clothes

33
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,239
不要紧，借妹妹穿啦！
It's all-right, just a loan for your sister

34
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,076
手拿起来啊！来，拿给我
Take her hands, now give it to me

35
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,992
被给他绑好
Tit it up this way

36
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,876
一个男人就是这样，手脚迟钝
Men are usually all thumbs

37
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,717
是要怎么跟人带孩子呢？
I wonder how you could take care of a child

38
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,593
小孩肚子饿了，先给她喝点米汤
She's hungry, give her some porridge first

39
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,715
乖乖！那来的小孩？
Good baby, whose child is it?

40
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,115
我看看…不哭…
let me see…Don't cry, good baby

41
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:32,668
你就是输了钱才知道回来
You'll never come home till you lose your money

42
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,914
你看不哭了吧？
She's stopped crying

43
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:35,918
那只脏手啦！
That hand's dirty

44
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,949
你看你别把小孩弄哭了嘛！
Look how you made her cry

45
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,956
小孩不能大声说话的嘛！
Kids mustn't talk loudly

46
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,076
哑吧，她叫什么名字？
Does she have a name, Mute?

47
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,919
叫宝贝啊！
Precious

48
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,519
宝贝？
Precious?

49
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,835
俗气！俗气！不好听！换一个
That's no class, just give her another name

50
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,953
你不要装懂了
Don't pretend you know it

51
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,559
你看得懂！你看得懂你念
If you know it, then read it

52
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,191
你们呀！拿反了，她叫阿美
You take it at a wrong way, she's Ah-mei

53
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,315
对了！阿美
An-mei!

54
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,789
阿美 阿美     阿美
An-mei…

55
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,072
这个女人是怎么搞的？
What's wrong with this woman?

56
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:50,515
不要给我打手势，少来这套
Don't give me any gesture

57
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,231
好了，不要给我打手势了
Okay, don't give me any of your gestures

58
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,234
哑叔
Uncle

59
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,713
今天要多拿一罐啊？
You need an extra can today?

60
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,190
喝年奶！要补是吗？
You need some milk? For your health?

61
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,388
不准走
Wait a minute

62
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,079
死哑吧，你凶什么凶 我跟你拼了…
Want to get rough? I'll show you

63
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:42,074
我们是什么样的人家？ 养得起这个丫头吗？
How do you believe we can afford this baby?

64
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,757
我白天替你浆浆洗洗，烧菜煮饭
I wash and cook for you everyday

65
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:49,760
晚上还要让你翻过来调过去的
And I satisfy your desire at night

66
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,599
你还把我们的米酒换成 这个丫头的奶粉
But you still forget our rice wine instead

67
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:53,954
日子不要过了
What kind of life is this?

68
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,198
是不是玩腻了？要撵我走啊？
You tired of me? Want to chase me off?

69
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,759
我告诉你哑吧，打从我搬进来那天起
Ever since the day I moved in

70
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:05,949
我就后悔！我后悔跟了你这个哑吧
I hate to live with a mute like you

71
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,510
我后悔跟了你这个捡破烂的
I hate to live with a garbage man like you

72
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,552
哑吧，昨天晚上你被修理了是不是？
You got clobbered, didn't you?

73
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,798
哑叔被人家打
Somebody gave him a fix

74
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:29,436
哑叔，早
Good morning, uncle

75
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,189
哑叔，眼镜借我看
Let me see your glasses, uncle

76
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,191
还要补是吗？要米酒？
Need something for your health? Rice wine?

77
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:28,718
也是有道理
It stands to reason

78
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:00,432
我走了，保重，芝兰
Take care, Chih-lan, bye-bye

79
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,069
哑叔
Uncle

80
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:59,676
当我走进这个家以后
But when I walked into this family

81
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,559
我们的命运就随着改变了
Our life changed all of a sudden

82
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,192
我得到了一个可以倚赖一辈子的人
I got a man I could depend on all my life

83
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:09,152
却让哑叔失去了一个情感上的伴侣
But uncle lost his company who is his partner

84
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,593
芝兰阿姨
Auntie Chi-Ian

85
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,112
我想这一切都是我造成的吧！
I think it was my fault, wasn't it?

86
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,632
因为芝兰阿姨 曾经那么努力地尝试着爱我
Because Auntie Chi-Ian tried her best…

87
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,914
照顾我
Just to love me and take care of me

88
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,714
而我却那么爱哭，爱闹
But I was such a naughty child

89
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:26,591
芝兰阿姨从哑叔 那里再也得不到往昔的爱
I made Auntie couldn't get any love from him

90
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,794
因为哑叔几乎把它的全部都给了我
Because uncle's given me almost everything

91
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,072
谢谢各位的掌声
Thanks for the applause

92
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,598
现在该轮到你们台下的人上来表演了
Now it's the time for audience to perform

93
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,876
有谁愿意上来表演的？
Who wants to come up and perform?

94
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,628
来…
Come on…

95
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,551
他啦！他会吹小喇叭！他啦！
Him! He can play a trumpet

96
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,789
来，孩子我来抱
Let me hold the baby

97
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:54,076
对…你去，你去
Right…go ahead

98
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,837
哑叔会吹剑
He's damn good

99
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:53,471
在成长的日子里 我曾经不止一次地想过
I once thought of that many times

100
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,754
我跟哑叔之间其实是有着同样的命运
Me and my uncle actually had the same fate

101
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:00,033
我们都遗弃过
We both had been deserted

102
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,149
我被生我的人
I was deserted by who gave birth to me

103
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,194
他被整个动荡，流离的时代
And the whole strenuous time deserted him

104
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,111
他曾经拥有挚爱的父母，家园，亲人
He'd once owned his parents and his family

105
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,510
和芝兰阿姨
And Auntie Chi-Ian

106
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,555
而转眼之间
But all of a sudden

107
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:17,594
除了思念，什么都不在了
Nothing existed but his heart

108
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,829
也许他曾经把我当成自己生命的延续
He might take me as his continuity of life

109
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,270
就像我浑沌未开的心灵中
Just like that chaos of my heart

110
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,795
早已经把它当成一个至高无上
Took it as something couldn't take place

111
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:29,196
无法取代的形象一样
Just like a supreme being in the days gone

112
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:33,389
然而 我却都没有办法用言语来表达…
But we couldn't talk to each other with words

113
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,758
哑吧，拜祖先啊！
Worshipping your ancestors!

114
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,350
阿美     阿美     阿美
Ah-mei

115
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,990
到我们家去吃年夜饭
Come to my house for New Year's dinner

116
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,228
你客气什么呢？
Be my guest

117
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,909
今天晚上咱们哥俩喝个痛快儿
Let's have a good drink today

118
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,355
你不给面子吗？
You aren't doing me favor, are you?

119
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:56,870
哑叔，哑叔，你看阿美
Take a look at Ah-mei, uncle

120
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,351
快叫爸爸，阿美，叫爸爸
Go tell Dad, Ah-mei

121
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,189
快点！阿美叫爸爸，爸爸
Ah-mei, hurry up, go and tell Dad

122
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,952
她不会也是个哑吧？
I wonder if she's mute too

123
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,432
你在胡说些什么？没人教当然是不会
What are you talking about?

124
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,710
阿满就是爱乱说话，你不要生气喔？
Ah-man's always a big mouth, don't be mad

125
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,517
阿明，我们回去了
Let's go home

126
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,630
哑叔，等一下一定要来喔！
Be sure to come over later, uncle

127
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,230
直到那一天，也许是阿明的引导
Until that day, it might be Ah-ming's hint

128
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,909
更也许是上天的催促
Or it might be help from heaven

129
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,549
我生平的第一句话是
My first word in my life is…

130
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,993
爸爸
Dad

131
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,352
爸爸
Dad

132
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:08,150
哑叔来…请坐…
This way, sit down please

133
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,954
怎么了！他说什么嘛？
What happened? What did he say?

134
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,874
阿美会叫爸爸了是不是？
Ah-mei can say Daddy

135
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,917
乌鸦养凤凰会叫了！
A phoenix raised by a crow can talk

136
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,354
阿美会叫爸爸了剑
Ah-mei knows how to say Daddy

137
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,114
来…叫爸爸
Now, say daddy

138
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:24,914
爸爸
Daddy

139
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,478
阿美，叫爸爸了
Ah-mei, you're wonderful

140
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,350
哑吧     哑吧
Mute

141
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,589
阿满叔
Uncle

142
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,032
阿美做功课啊！
Improving your mind!

143
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,079
来啊…快来啊！
Come on

144
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,108
哑吧，今天立冬进点补吧
It's winter beginning, let's have extra natty

145
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:17,312
有一道菜，我老婆不会做
There's one dish my wife can't make

146
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,628
你能不能帮忙？
Can you help with it?

147
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:26,034
吃香肉啊！
Dog meat!

148
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,871
对不起了小狗，早死早投胎
Sorry, doggie, I'll help you be reincarnated

149
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,714
下辈子到洋人家里面喝牛奶，睡沙发
You'll belong to a foreign family

150
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:00,751
还外带美容呢！
That'll make your next life better

151
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:11,429
爸爸，有狗在叫她？是谁家的？
There's a dog barking, whose dog is it?

152
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,431
阿美，没你的事，做功课呢？
None of your business, go back your homework

153
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,631
快把开水倒进盆里
Just put it into the pan

154
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:26,552

00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,831
苦难通常使一个人忘记昨天
Misery makes a man forget about yesterday

315
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:04,833
而踏实地活在今天的劳累中
It makes people live in today's fatigue

316
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:09,794
于是任它季节更替物换星移
No matter how fast time would pass

317
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:13,436
日子对我们来说都是一样的
Everyday to us is the same

318
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:17,589
一样的邻居朋友，一样的作夜息
The same neighbors and friends, the same work

319
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,869
直到某一天
Until one day…

320
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,952
当我蓦然发觉爸爸怎么白发斑驳 一脸皱纹
Suddenly I found something white in my father's head

321
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:30,518
那个时候，我才发现我已经长大了
Then I found that I'm grown up

322
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:33,992
而且一个崭新的奇异的世界
And a strange now world has tied us together

323
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:37,834
已经在不知不觉中 把我们紧紧的围住了
So secretly and so tightly

324
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,079
小老鼠，快点啦！
Come on, little mouse

325
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,319
老大，急什么又不是跟阿美结婚
It's not a marriage with Ah-mei

326
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,517
再罗嗦，我扁你喔！
Shut up or I'll fix you

327
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,358
阿明！ 你买那么多菜是要办酒席是吗？
You bought that much food for a feast?

328
00:34:57,360 --> 00:35:00,158
阿美今天第一天上班，给她庆祝一下
To celebrate her first day at work

329
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,075
你看我家阿明啊！ 比那上班的人还要紧张
Ah-ming's more anxious than she is

330
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,348
哑叔，你看
Look, uncle

331
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:11,316
哑叔
Uncle

332
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:20,478
不用了…今天我赚了一点外快
It's okay, I've made some extra money today

333
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,556
不要客气啦！
Don't get mad, Uncle

334
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,877
是不是又遇到一个阔寡妇呀？
You'd run into another rich window, didn't you?

335
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,356
你不要乱讲话，我可没跟她干什么
Don't talk nonsense, I've got nothing to do with her

336
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,671
我只不过说她长的很漂亮
I only say that she's beautiful

337
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:29,830
真的很漂亮？
Is she beautiful

338
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:32,595
当然！跟你长得差不多啦！
Sure she is, beautiful as you

339
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,515
阿明，阿美到底是几多点下班？
When does Ah-mei finish her work?

340
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,509
我来炒两样小菜，我们来吃宵夜
Let me make some dishes for our snack

341
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,158
给我一道
Give me a ray of warming light

342
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,592
温柔的光

343
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:03,199
莫在今宵
Don't maintain that you're in a stupor

344
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:09,960
强说迷惘

345
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,793
和我一起
Dance with me to our heart's desire

346
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:21,389
尽情舞蹈

347
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:26,916
陌生的人
How much loneliness does a stranger have

348
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:32,830
寂寞多少

349
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,516
再听一听，叮叮当当
Listen again-ding dong, ding dong

350
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:45,110
那里来的音符真教人心伤
How the distant notes pierce my heart

351
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,675
再唱一唱Do Be Do Wa
Sing again - do be do wa

352
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,230
想学我的模样就别再心伤
Feeling of sorrow if you'd like to stimulate

353
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,919
我送你回家好不好？
I'll take you home, okay?

354
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,318
我刚才不是故意的
I didn't mean it just now

355
00:37:36,360 --> 00:37:38,271
我说你唱的不好是真的
But it's true you don't sing well

356
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:47,950
你不要生气嘛！女孩子要有风度
Don't be angry, act like a lady

357
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:50,116
难道你唱得不好 还要我说你唱得好啊
You want me to lie about your singing?

358
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,229
这样不是太虚伪了吗？
Wouldn't that be pretty vain?

359
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,395
好了好了，你唱得好 你唱得比谁都好
Okay, you sing very well, better than anybody

360
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,079
比邓丽君都好，可以了吧？
Even better than Teresa Teng, satisfy?

361
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:58,471
我警告你，你没有资格批评我
You have no right to criticize me

362
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,035
我是没资格批评你
True, I have no right

363
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,951
不过你唱得好不 我一听就听出来了
But I can tell if you sing well or not

364
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,834
我是作曲的 我想我可以给你一点意见
I'm a composer, I can give you some advice

365
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,915
岂有此理，你这个死仔 你是怎么开车的

366
00:38:11,080 --> 00:38:13,799
下车，下车，打你一顿才行

367
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,036
岂有此理，怎么开车的

368
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:20,198
你的车
You car

369
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,797
没关系，倒霉的不是我 是借车给我的朋友
It's okay, too bad for the owner, though

370
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:24,955
上车
Get in

371
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,030
后来这条歌居然红了
Later on the song became a hit

372
00:38:56,360 --> 00:38:58,191
爸，我回来了
I'm home, Dad

373
00:38:58,680 --> 00:39:01,877
爸，我给你介绍 他是时君迈，是作曲的
<i>Dad, he's Shin Chun-mai, a song writer</i>

374
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,109
这是我爸爸
My Dad

375
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,278
来福，不要这么没礼貌
Don't be so rude, Dai-fu

376
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,793
要不要到我们家坐坐？
Want to come to my house and sit for a while

377
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:16,515
不用了，以后有的是机会，拜拜
No…there'll be opportunities later

378
00:39:16,840 --> 00:39:17,590

Good-bye

379
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,394

爸，走吧！
Let's go, Dad

381
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,995
爸，我告诉你，刚刚的时君迈
<i>That Shin Chun-mai I just mentioned, Dad</i>

382
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:31,792
他说他有好多首新歌
He said he's got some new songs

383
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,439
要我唱他的歌剑∷要亲自教我
Which fits me and he wants to teach me personally

384
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:35,555
我好开心啊！
I'm so happy

385
00:39:36,600 --> 00:39:37,794

爸，你先吃嘛！
Go ahead, Dad

389
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:00,879
一早就喝酒，你不开车了
Drinking so early, you are not driving, are you?

390
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,189
妈，你不要管我
Leave me alone, Mom

391
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,395
什么！你说什么，你说什么…
What do you think you are?

我们大伙住这 已经住了…，三十年了
Much of us have lived here for thirty years

393
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,028
你一叫我们搬，我们就得搬啊？
Where did you have us move to?

394
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:10,992
你们大家来评评理
Please give a fin comment, you guys

395

00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,551
怎么了？菊嫂，怎么回事吗？
What's the matter, Auntie?

违章建筑是一定要拆的
The illegal building must be torn down

399
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,437
政府要你们搬家 一定会给你们补助的嘛
The government will make up for you

400
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,837
大人呀！别说笑了
What a joke

补助的钱啊！只能买两个杨杨米
Money is only enough to buy two pieces of candy

402
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,158
骗我们不懂啊？
What do you take me for, a child?

国民住宅，你们可以优先登记呀！
You have preference for government housing

405
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,356
站好

不要激动嘛！ 我只是吃公家饭替政府做事

你们自己人，所以可以优先登记

就是啊！ 你们自己的人当然是自己维护自己人
The government will protect only those who are the same

411
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:51,350
叫别人搬家，这样有道理吗？
How can you tell other people to move

412
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,557
你们大家评评理，这种人不打怎么行
Such a man like him needs a good lesson

413
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:56,229
一群疯狗，我告诉你们
A bunch of mad dogs, I'm telling you…

414
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,714
要是不搬的话，就别怪我不客气
If you don't move out, I'll get rough with you

415
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:01,235
什么不客气？你想欺负我们吗？
What do you mean by that? get rough with us

416
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,475
你别跑！别跑！
Don't run away

00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,350
打！
Beat him

418
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,316
你跟我凶什么凶？我早就想打人了
Why me? I want to beat somebody too

419
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:09,194

424
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:29,196
拆房子是大家的事 又不是光拆我们的
Our house isn't the only one to be torn down

425
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,430
大不了，搬家就是了嘛！
Anyway, we'll have to move

426
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:38,229
钱！爸，你不要担心
Don't worry about the money, Dad

余广泰 我的下一张唱片什么时候出啊？
When will my next record be released?

467
00:46:05,360 --> 00:46:08,318
沈妮，你上张唱片己经卖得不好了
Your last record didn't sell well

468
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,035
我看，你暂时先做做秀吧！可是…
I think you'd better offer some shows nowadays

469
00:46:12,080 --> 00:46:13,433
经理，孙小姐来了
Manager, Miss Shen's here

470
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:20,395
沈妮，我有重要事情要谈
I've got something to discuss with you

471
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,159
你先出去一下好吗？
You leave for a while, okay?

472
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:26,508
沈姐姐
Sister Shen

473
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,794
孙小姐，我希望你取代沈妮
I hope you could take Shen-ni's place

474
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:37,750
为什么？
Why?

475
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:40,992
观众需要新的刺激，新的面孔
The audience needs some new excitements, new faces

476
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:44,595
沈妮那一套，观众早已经看腻了
They tired of Shen-ni now

477
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:46,752
你的条件比她好多了
Your qualifications are better

478
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,553
我有这个条件吗？
Do you think I'm qualified?

479
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,238
你觉得沈妮有条件吗？
Do you think she's qualified?

480
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:53,956
她以前不过是个舞小姐 连国语都说不好
She was a dancer, she couldn't speak Chinese

481
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:56,833
所以呀条件不在你，是在我
The qualifications depend on me, not you

482
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,479
只要你什么都听我的安排
You just do whatever I tell you…

483
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,956
我保证你将来一定比沈妮还红
And you'll be bigger than she is

484
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,992
好，我答应你
Okay, I agree

485
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:05,830
不过我有一个条件
But I have a requirement

486
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:07,434
有什么条件？
What's that?

487
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,598
我要他帮我作曲
I want him to compose for me

488
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:17,037
时先生，很抱歉，恕我直言
<i>Mr. Shin, I'm sorry, I have 10 tell you the true</i>

489
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,709
我们要的是雅俗共赏的商业歌曲
What we need are commercial songs

490
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:22,758
而不是你那种自弹自唱的民谣歌曲
Not those folk songs, like yours

491
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,910
孙小姐，这点我很坚持
That's what I insist, Miss Sun

492
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,589
我希望你考虑，考虑
I hope you'll think it over

493
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:28,829
余广泰是什么东西？
What does he think he is?

494
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:30,313
GA丫，市侩，俗气
Gay, a shark, vulgar

495
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,875
你看沈妮唱了多少歌 那一条是有水准的
None of Shen-ni's songs has class

496
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,792
我才没那么无聊替他作曲
Would I write those stupid songs?

497
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,957
他那种钱啊！我不稀罕
I don't care these money he earned

498
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,558
如果你喜欢你跟他去好了
If you like him, go with him

499
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:41,148
我只是想多赚点钱 买栋房子给我爸爸
I just want to make more money and buy my father a house

500
00:47:41,200 --> 00:47:42,474
让他生活过得好一点
That'll make him a better life

501
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:44,074
难道我这样做也错了吗？
Am I doing wrong?

502
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:47,193
如果你不喜欢 我现在就可以打电话拒绝他
I you don't like it, I'll give him a call right now

503
00:48:02,240 --> 00:48:03,878
我想你还是答应他
Maybe you should go along with him

504
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,349
好，袁小姐，麻烦你
Okay, thanks for your trouble, Miss Yuen

505
00:48:19,480 --> 00:48:20,310
哪里
It's nothing, nothing

506
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,473
我们现在完成了第一步
Now we've finished the first step

507
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:25,996
第二步，我要替你改个名子
And the second is to change your name

508
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,514
改个名字啊？
Change my name?

509
00:48:27,600 --> 00:48:29,909
对！改个名字就是换一个人
Yes, just like making a new person

510
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:33,829
从现在开始，你的名字叫做孙瑞琪
From now on your name is Sun Jui-chi

511
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:35,991
孙瑞琪
Sun Jui-chi

512
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:39,237
还有，我已经替你 租了一栋很舒适的房子
By the way, I've rent a very comfortable room for you

513
00:48:39,320 --> 00:48:40,719
明天你就可以搬进去住
You can move in tomorrow

514
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,630
为什么？
Why?

515
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:45,675
因为我要把你捧成歌星中的名星
Because I want to make you a star of all stars

516
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:47,552
我要告诉传播界
I'll inform the mass media

517
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:50,792
说你是在富有 而有教养的家庭中长大
You grow up from a wealthy and cultured family

518
00:48:51,280 --> 00:48:53,748
我要你充满了大家闺秀的气质
And make you full of the manner of a fine lady

519
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:57,870
让所有的观众看得到，而摸不着
Something the audience can see, not touched

520
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:00,388
哑叔，你真的答应阿美搬出去住啊？
You're allowing Ah-mei to move out

521
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:02,551
我跟你说，现在当歌星得危险啊！
It's dangerous to be a singer these days

522
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,990
那些有钱人一天到晚在打歌星的主意
Rich men are always after them

523
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,554
不行，不行哪！小老鼠，你说
It won't do, you say it, mouse

524
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:09,829
好
Okay

525
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,469
哑叔，你每天收旧报纸
You collect newspaper everyday

526
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:15,152
你没有看报上说啊！
Don't you read what's in them?

527
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,392
那些坏人啊最喜欢绑架那些女歌星了
Bad guys like to abduct singers

528
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:21,040
把她们的衣服剥光，拍裸体照
Take their clothes off and photograph them

529
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:23,389
就像什么封面女郎什么的？
Like that Spin-up Girl case

530
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:24,635
真的她！
It's really

531
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:27,908
阿明，你要我说的我都说了
An-ming, I said what you wanted

532
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,351
做歌星那有什么不好？
What's wrong to be a star?

533
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,956
以后要是出了名，找一个有钱人
Get famous and find a rich man

534
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:37,872
到那个时候，钱比米都多喔！
You'll have more money than rice

535
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,518
哑叔到那个时候 吃，穿都不用烦恼了
Uncle will have everything then

536
00:49:42,600 --> 00:49:43,476
对啦！
That's right

537
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:45,670
到时候 连你这个爸爸都不会认了啦！
Then she won't recognize her own father

538
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,031
阿明，你不要胡说
I don't think Ah-mei's like that

539
00:49:50,120 --> 00:49:53,317
我想阿美她不是那种人
Don't be silly, Ah-ming

540
00:49:53,760 --> 00:49:55,990
她只是想多赚一点钱
She just wants to make some money

541
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,513
爸，我回来了
Dad, I'm back

542
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,033
东西在那儿
My stuff is there

543
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:11,799
阿美，你爸爸等你吃饭，等了很久了
Your father is waiting so long, for having dinner with you

544
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,671
爸爸，我不能在家里吃饭了
I can't eat at home, Dad

545
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:16,399
公司安排我今天要跟记者
The company's arranged a party

546
00:50:16,680 --> 00:50:18,716
还有唱片公司的老板一起吃饭
With reporters and the record company boss

547
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,513
吃完饭，我还要练歌呢！
I have to practice singing after dinner

548
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:24,717
但爸爸你放心 我一定会常常回来看爸爸的
But I'll come and see you often, Dad

549
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:25,795
再见
Good-bye

550
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:27,117
什么时候儿时玩伴都离我远去
When did the frog croaks become memory

551
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:33,790
什么时候身旁的人已不再熟悉
When did the land become so crowded

552
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:40,316
人潮的拥挤，拉开了我们的距离
With tall buildings towering all around

553
00:51:41,120 --> 00:51:43,475
沉默的大地
And neon signs making the night so harsh

554
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:49,034
把地面的夜晚默默的吐气

555
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:56,351
谁能告诉我，谁能告诉我
Who can tell me? Who can tell?

556
00:51:56,840 --> 00:51:59,718
是我们改变了世界
Did we change the world

557
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:03,230
还是世界改变了我
Or did the world change you and me?

558
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:06,875
和你

559
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:12,155
一样的月光
The same moonlight

560
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:17,913
一样的照着新店溪
Shines on the same Hsintien River

561
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,035
一样的冬天
The same winter

562
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:27,314
一样的下着冰冷的雨
Brings the same cold rains

563
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:31,437
一样的尘埃
The same dust

564
00:52:31,760 --> 00:52:37,915
一样的在风中堆积
Is blown by the same wind

565
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:41,876
一样的笑容
The same smiles

566
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,232
一样的泪水
The same tears

567
00:52:45,360 --> 00:52:46,713
一样的日子
The same days

568
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:52,673
一样的我和你
The same you and me

569
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,192
一样的笑容
The same smiles

570
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,631
一样的泪水
The same tears

571
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,472
一样的日子
The same days

572
00:53:01,600 --> 00:53:07,835
一样的我和你
The same you and me

573
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,356
阿美还真漂亮剑
Ah-ming's really beautiful

574
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:27,679
真好听，真好听
Sounds really good

575
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:30,439
哑叔，你可以放心了，是不是？
You don't have to worry now, do you?

576
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,553
你看阿美实在真行啊！
See? Ah-ming's really wonderful

577
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:37,232
她一定会变成一个很红很红的歌星
She'll be a very popular singer

578
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,359
谢谢，谢谢
Thank you, thank you

579
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,514
请问孙小姐 听说你生长在一个大家庭
I hear you grew up on a wealthy family

580
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:54,313
请问你父亲做什么生意的？
What business is your father in?

581
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:55,636
我父亲…
My father…

582
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:57,791
她父亲是个大建筑商
Her father's a big contractor

583
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,876
现在全家移民到美国去了
He's emigrated to America now

584
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:02,191
只留下孙小姐一个人在国内
Only Miss Sun is left here

585
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:06,836
请问孙小姐 你一个人在国内都做些什么
How do you make a living here, Miss Sun

586
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:08,990
那要看我的经纪人怎么安排了？
It depends on my manager's arrangement

587
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,191
明天孙小姐就要到东南亚巡回演唱吧
She stars a Southeast Asian tour tomorrow

588
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:13,959
一月以后再回国
She'll be back in a month

589
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:17,870
到时候将会举办一个 全国最大型的演唱会
The she'll have the biggest concert here

590
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,637
孙小姐，问你个题外话
Let me ask an irrelevant question?

591
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,631
你有没有比较亲密的男朋友啊？
Do you have a close boy friend?

592
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:27,438
到底有没有啊？
Well? Do you?

593
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:33,272
有啊！很多，只要是爱护我的观众
Yes, a lot of them, my listeners

594
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:34,594
都是我最亲密的朋友
My listeners are my closest friends

595
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:46,675
其实你最近身体不太好 根本就不应该出来
You aren't well, shouldn't come out

596
00:54:52,240 --> 00:54:53,798
阿美也太过份了
Ah-mei's gone too far

597
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,229
搬出去这么久才回来看你两三次
Only coming back so rarely to see you

598
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:01,430
开记者招待会也不来邀请你 太不像话了
Not asking you to her press conference

599
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:02,913
等一下看到她，一定要问问她
When I see her, I'll ask her about that

600
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:14,155
你这个人怎么搞的？
What's the matter with you?

601
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,830
你不是那个大歌星沈妮呢？
Aren't you that great singer, Shen-ni?

602
00:55:24,600 --> 00:55:28,434
我就是那个大歌星沈妮
Yes, I'm that great singer

603
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:31,591
怎么，要不要签名啊？
Why? You want my antograph

604
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:35,749
拿笔来啊？
Give me a pen

605
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,915
我又不是你的歌迷 我们是来找阿美的
I'm not your friend, I came to see Ah-mei

606
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:42,271
什么阿美不阿美的？
Who's Ah-mei?

607
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:45,077
阿美就是孙瑞琪嘛！
Ah-mei's Sun Jui-chi

608
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:47,716
孙瑞琪？
Sun Jui-chi

609
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,512
孙瑞琪有什么了不起的？
What's so great about her?

610
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:55,230
她的歌那能跟我比啊？
How can her singing compare with mine?

611
00:55:57,280 --> 00:56:00,317
她只不过比我年轻，漂亮
She's just younger and prettier, that's all

612
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:06,391
一个人不可能永远年轻漂亮的
Nobody's young and pretty forever

613
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:12,160
总有一天，她也会掉下来
Anyway one day she'll fall

614
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:14,829
永远都爬不起来！
Then she'll never come up again

615
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,955
你讲话要客气一点喔！
Be careful about what you say

616
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:21,597
什么客气不客气？你跟她什么关系？
So what? What's she to you?

617

大建筑商的爸爸，刚刚从美国回来的

626
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,436
你们看一看，就是这个样子的

627
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,075
各位！他不是她爸爸
He isn't her father, folks

628
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,390
你们看，他像她爸爸吗？
Does he look like him?

629
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:15,399
他们俩个只不过是热情的观众而已
They're just enthusiastic fans

630
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,829
什么热情的观众？他真的是她爸爸

你想行骗是吗？
You're trying to pull a fast one?

632
00:57:19,280 --> 00:57:21,430
行骗！你才行骗呢！
You're the fraud

633
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:25,356
阿美，阿美，你跟他讲
Tell them, Ah-mei

634
00:57:25,360 --> 00:57:28,670
他是不是你爸爸？你说啊！
Isn't he your father? Speak up

635
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:33,357
你们看 他自己都不承认是孙瑞琪的爸爸
See? Even he doesn't say it

636
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:36,513
他们两个不是骗子是什么？骗子
If they're not frauds, what are they?

637
00:57:36,560 --> 00:57:37,993
阿美，你过来，你过来

00:57:38,360 --> 00:57:40,396
你跟他们说，你跟他们说他是你爸爸
Tel them he's your father

639
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:41,715
你怎么不说？
Why don't you speak up?

640
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:49,909
阿美，不行！我求你
No, Ah-mei, please

641
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,277
阿美，你就听我这一次
Listen to me, just this once

642
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,954
爸爸，对不起
Dad, I'm sorry

643
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,799
少来这一套 现在说对不起已经太晚了啊
It's too late to say that now

644
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:37,440
你现在很拽了 看不起我们了是不是？
You're popular and you despite us now

645
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:38,590
谁看不起你们嘛？
Who despite you?

646
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,392
阿明，你不要胡闹好不好？
Don't say silly things, Ah-ming

647
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:44,229
你说我胡闹，你娘的！
Me said silly things? Dame you

648
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:45,275
阿明，不要这样嘛！
Don't be that way

649
00:58:45,360 --> 00:58:47,316
好…阿美 …十多年来只得到你这句话
Over 20 years and this is what I get

650
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,676
我真的没有看不起你们嘛！
I really don't despise you

651
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:51,910
我们不配和你在一起了 现在你是大歌星
You're star, we're not on the level as high as you

652
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:52,910
没有
No…

653
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,394
阿明，你少讲两句
Ah-ming, don't talk so much

654
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:55,516
现在你可以走了
You can go now

655
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:57,279
你根本就不属于我们这里的
You don't belong here

656
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,715
没有你，我们一样过啦
We can get along without you

657
00:58:58,960 --> 00:58:59,995
你本来就是捡来的
You're just a foundling, anyway

658
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,996
阿明，你说完了没有？
Are you finished, Ah-ming?

659
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:14,078
阿美…
Ah-mei

660
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:16,716
阿美…
Ah-mei

661
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,591
我从小看阿美长大
I watched Ah-mei grow up

662
01:01:16,000 --> 01:01:20,232
我相信她不是那种人，我对她有信心
She isn't like that, I believe in her…

663
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,990
你自己血压高，不要再喝酒了
Stop drinking, your high blood pressure

664
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:06,638
我们也许曾经相知，相爱
Ah-mei, we may have loved once

665
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:11,278
但是，爱情与恩情是有分别的
But love and friendship are different

666
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,836
我想你了解我的意思
You know what I mean

667
01:02:14,320 --> 01:02:18,871
抱歉，我走了，时君迈
Sorry, I'm leaving, Shi Chun-mai

668
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:25,790
想起初相见似地转天旋
Think how the earth shook when we met

669
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:28,998
当意念改变
And then the changes, like passing mists

670
01:02:29,400 --> 01:02:35,555
如过眼云烟

671
01:02:39,120 --> 01:02:44,752
在季节变换的天空里
As the seasons change in he heavens

672
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:50,633
你游游荡荡不已
You wander without end

673
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:57,430
在星月移动的夜空下 星马，香港，会有人照顾你的
Under the sky with its traveling orbs People will entertainment you in Singapore and Hong Kong

674
01:02:57,560 --> 01:02:59,232
台北我实在分不开身
I can't leave here

675
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:01,549

好，我先预祝你这次巡回演唱成功

对了！ 你不要忘了吧…十万交给我爸爸
Don't forget, give Dad two hundred thousand

678
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:11,073
他需要这笔钱买房子
He needs it to buy a house

679
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:13,397
好，我尽快把钱送去
Okay, I'll send it to him

680
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:15,233
谢谢，我先走了
Thanks, good-bye

681
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:20,118
就把我不愿想起的过去
I'll cast aside unwanted memories

682
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:24,233
丢向天际
Far away, they lose their mystery

683
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:27,632
一览无遗

684
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:34,155
不再神秘

685
01:03:35,840 --> 01:03:39,071
想起初相见
Think how the earth shook when we met

686
01:03:39,360 --> 01:03:42,477
似地转天旋

687
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:45,797
当意念改变
And then the changes, like passing mists

688
01:03:46,040 --> 01:03:52,149
如过眼云烟

689
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:21,309
在季节变换的天空里
As the seasons change in the heavens

690
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:27,676
你游游荡荡不已
You wander without end

691
01:04:28,680 --> 01:04:34,755
在星月移动的夜空下
Under the sky with its traveling orbs

692
01:04:35,120 --> 01:04:40,990
像迷迷蒙蒙轻纱
In a gauss like haze

693
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:47,717
我一不小心失去的情感
I was careless, lost my love

694
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,595
说来遗憾
Much to my regret

695
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:57,199
就把我不愿想起的过去
I'll cast aside unwanted memories

696
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,751
丢向天际
Far away, they lose their mystery

697
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:04,038
一览无遗

698
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:10,635
不再神秘

699
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:15,468
想起初相见
Think how the earth shook when we met

700
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,797
似地转天旋

701
01:05:19,080 --> 01:05:22,117
当意念改变
And then the changes, like passing mists

702
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:28,555
如过眼云烟

703
01:05:31,760 --> 01:05:35,275
想起初相见
Think how the earth shook when we met

704
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:38,831
似地转天旋

705
01:05:39,120 --> 01:05:41,998
当意念改变
And then the changes, like passing mists

706
01:05:42,280 --> 01:05:48,469
如过眼云烟

707
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,950
当如雷的掌声响起时
When thunder-like applause came

708
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:55,669
我知道这一切都是我的
I knew it was all mine

709
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,309
我应该兴奋，感动
I should be moved and excited

710
01:05:58,960 --> 01:06:01,030
但是没有人知道
But nobody knows that…

711
01:06:01,480 --> 01:06:04,995
在这一刹那间 我却更加的孤单，寂寞
I felt so lonely at that moment

712
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:08,593
因为台下没有一位是我想看到的人
Nobody down there is who I wanted to see

713
01:06:09,080 --> 01:06:10,638
他们都在千里之外
They're all thousand miles away

714
01:07:11,360 --> 01:07:14,079
没有救了，人道毁灭了
It's hopeless, humanity is dead

715
01:07:47,840 --> 01:07:51,389
爸，你看好可怜哦！头上都是血
He's pitiful, his head's all bloody

716
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:52,879
来福，我们回家

她说等香港演唱会一完 马上就回来看你

723
01:09:14,720 --> 01:09:16,995

01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:25,719
你认识阿美啊？
Do you know Ah-mei?

776
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:12,909
请问，你知不知道这里的人 都搬到那儿去了？
Where did the people here move to?

777
01:18:13,920 --> 01:18:17,071
我也不知道，你来找人吗？
Don't know, you're looking for somebody?

778
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:22,189
有个老朋友，…十几年没见了
An old friend I haven't seen for 20 years

779
01:18:22,280 --> 01:18:23,474
想看一看他
I want to see him

780
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:29,628
没想到，这里已经变成这个样子
But this place has changed so much

781
01:18:32,640 --> 01:18:34,119
我先走了
Good-bye

782
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:44,669
阿美，阿美，到处找不到你
Ah-mei, I've been looking for you all day already

783
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:45,675
我就知道你跑到这儿来了
Finally, I guess you came here

784
01:18:45,720 --> 01:18:46,755
你怎么给我交待？
What have you to say about this?

785
01:18:49,080 --> 01:18:50,513
什么时候变成这样子，我也不知道
I don't when this happened

786
01:18:51,400 --> 01:18:52,674
我要去找我爸爸
I want to find my father

787
01:18:52,960 --> 01:18:55,872
阿美，…十万我早已经交给你爸爸了
I gave him the money, like you said

788
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:57,275
他会照顾他自己
He can take care of himself

789
01:18:57,760 --> 01:18:59,990
演唱会就要开始了 我们时间已经不够了
We have to prepare for the concert

790
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:02,754
你要宣传，排练，参加记者招待会
You have a press conference too

791
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,193
我们有太多太多的事情要做
We've got too many things to do

792
01:19:04,240 --> 01:19:06,276
阿美，你不能这样毁了你自己呀
You can't destroy yourself this way

793
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:09,152
就算我求你好不好？
I'm begging

794
01:19:11,600 --> 01:19:15,149
还好阿美出国前留下了一笔钱
It's luck Ah-mei left that money

795
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:20,116
阿明的丧事和我开的面摊 都是用她这笔钱
It covered Ah-ming's funeral, the noodle store

796
01:19:20,120 --> 01:19:22,076
日子还算过得去
We can get by

797
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:25,074
就是哑叔他整天想着阿美
Uncle thinks of Ah-mei all day

798
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,994
虽然他不说，我也看得出来
He doesn't say so, but I can tell

799
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:30,315
所以我就陪他住在一起
So I live with him

800
01:19:32,200 --> 01:19:34,760
哑叔最近身体也不好
His health isn't good lately

801
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:37,355
住在一起比较好照顾
I can't take care of him, living there

802
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:41,115
反正年纪也大了，也不怕人家说闲话
I'm too old to care what people say

803
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:52,076
哑叔又在吹了
Uncle's blowing again

804
01:19:52,720 --> 01:19:57,316
阿美小的时候一哭 哑叔就用这个声音逗她
He used to soothe Ah-mei that way

805
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:01,439
她的眼泪还来不及 擦就笑得好可爱哦！
That would make her laugh, so cute

806
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:06,477
自从阿美出国以后
Since Ah-mei went abroad

807
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:09,313
哑叔每天都要吹好几次
Uncle blows all the time

808
01:20:09,720 --> 01:20:10,869
我突然想做一件事
There something

809
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:14,636
对不起，我不进去了，帮我问候哑叔
Say hello to uncle for me

810
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,678
阿美回来了
Ah-mei's come back

811
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:43,597
她刚回国一定很忙 过两天我就去找她
I'll go see her in a couple of days

812
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:46,875
酒研倘卖呒
Want to sell wine bottles?

813
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:21,195
总经埋
President

814
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:33,556
阿美，试试我为你写的新曲
Ah-mei, try the song I wrote for you

815
01:21:34,040 --> 01:21:35,917
希望你能在演唱会上
I hope

816
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,356
唱给所有需要爱的朋友听
You can sing it for those who need love

817
01:21:38,880 --> 01:21:40,632
特别是你爸爸
Especially for your father

818
01:21:41,120 --> 01:21:42,109
时君迈
<i>Shin Chun-mai</i>

819
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:48,037
酒，干，倘，卖，呒…

822
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:23,556
一样的月光
The same moonlight

823
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:30,430
一样的照着新店溪
Shines on the same Hsintien River

824
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:37,674
一样的冬天
The same winter

825
01:22:38,480 --> 01:22:44,715
一样的下着冰冷的雨
Brings the same cold rains

826
01:22:46,560 --> 01:22:50,678
一样的尘埃
The same dust

827
01:22:52,160 --> 01:22:58,395
一样的在风中堆积
Is blown by the same wind

828
01:23:01,320 --> 01:23:04,596
一样的笑容
The same smiles

829
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:09,519

830
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,639

什么时候蛙鸣蝉声都成了记忆
When did the frog croaks become memory

837
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:08,516
什么时候家乡变得如此的拥挤
When did the land become so crowded

838
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:11,997
高楼大厦
With tall buildings towering all around

839
01:24:12,360 --> 01:24:15,636
到处耸立

840
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:18,115
七彩霓虹
And neon signs making the night so harsh

841
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:24,270
把夜空染得如此的俗气

842
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:31,710
谁能告诉我，谁能告诉我
Who can tell me? Who can tell?

843
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:35,157
是我们改变了世界
Did we change the world

假如你不曾养育我
Without you to raise me

虽然你不会表达你的真情
