1
00:01:39,779 --> 00:01:43,365
Go, go soon

2
00:01:43,866 --> 00:01:45,910
Knock if off, go

3
00:01:50,998 --> 00:01:52,750
Disgust, you old bastard

4
00:01:53,042 --> 00:01:56,921
Enough of that, go

5
00:01:58,464 --> 00:02:00,299
Don't forget to bring some wine

6
00:02:10,893 --> 00:02:12,353
I need a wipe, Mom

7
00:02:12,728 --> 00:02:13,646
Now

8
00:02:14,814 --> 00:02:15,815
Good morning, uncle

9
00:02:16,565 --> 00:02:17,608
Let's have a bite

10
00:02:17,942 --> 00:02:20,861
There are some vegetable for you

11
00:02:22,863 --> 00:02:24,698
What are you doing here? Go back home

12
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,242
Or I'm going to tell your sister

13
00:02:27,034 --> 00:02:28,285
Good morning, uncle

14
00:02:28,786 --> 00:02:34,124
I want to go with you, uncle

15
00:02:38,838 --> 00:02:41,757
Please, uncle

16
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:06,156
The story began from my first sight at uncle

17
00:03:06,615 --> 00:03:11,203
I was only two months
old like a piece of garbage

18
00:03:11,287 --> 00:03:13,038
And dropped on the sidewalk

19
00:03:13,747 --> 00:03:16,876
Nobody could tell me why

20
00:03:17,334 --> 00:03:20,170
When he's holding me in his arms

21
00:03:20,212 --> 00:03:22,756
I felt that I'd never leave it

22
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:26,343
because he made me feel so cozy and warm

23
00:03:26,677 --> 00:03:30,931
Just like any father to his children

24
00:03:35,436 --> 00:03:37,229
Her name is Ah-mei

25
00:03:37,646 --> 00:03:41,817
The gods will protect whoever adopts her

26
00:03:42,109 --> 00:03:44,153
From a pitiful person

27
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:49,825
Uncle's got a baby

28
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,077
Uncle's got a baby

29
00:03:52,369 --> 00:03:53,996
Uncle's got a baby

30
00:03:54,455 --> 00:03:56,081
Uncle's got a baby

31
00:03:56,707 --> 00:03:59,835
Uncle's got a baby

32
00:04:02,171 --> 00:04:02,922
That's me my clothes

33
00:04:02,922 --> 00:04:04,256
It's all-right, just a loan for your sister

34
00:04:04,632 --> 00:04:08,093
Take her hands, now give it to me

35
00:04:08,385 --> 00:04:10,012
Tit it up this way

36
00:04:10,512 --> 00:04:13,891
Men are usually all thumbs

37
00:04:13,933 --> 00:04:15,726
I wonder how you could take care of a child

38
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:18,604
She's hungry, give her some porridge first

39
00:04:24,526 --> 00:04:26,737
Good baby, whose child is it?

40
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,114
let me see...Don't cry, good baby

41
00:04:30,199 --> 00:04:32,660
You'll never come home till you lose your money

42
00:04:32,701 --> 00:04:33,911
She's stopped crying

43
00:04:34,370 --> 00:04:35,913
That hand's dirty

44
00:04:36,622 --> 00:04:38,958
Look how you made her cry

45
00:04:38,999 --> 00:04:40,960
Kids mustn't talk loudly

46
00:04:41,043 --> 00:04:43,087
Does she have a name, Mute?

47
00:04:43,504 --> 00:04:44,922
Precious

48
00:04:45,214 --> 00:04:46,507
Precious?

49
00:04:47,633 --> 00:04:49,843
That's no class, just give her another name

50
00:04:51,428 --> 00:04:52,972
Don't pretend you know it

51
00:04:55,849 --> 00:04:58,560
If you know it, then read it

52
00:04:58,644 --> 00:05:03,190
You take it at a wrong way, she's Ah-mei

53
00:05:03,190 --> 00:05:04,316
An-mei!

54
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,819
An-mei...

55
00:05:11,323 --> 00:05:13,075
What's wrong with this woman?

56
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,529
Don't give me any gesture

57
00:06:29,401 --> 00:06:31,236
Okay, don't give me any of your gestures

58
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:15,239
Uncle

59
00:07:20,202 --> 00:07:21,703
You need an extra can today?

60
00:07:38,137 --> 00:07:40,180
You need some milk? For your health?

61
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:10,419
Wait a minute

62
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:17,092
Want to get rough? I'll show you

63
00:08:39,489 --> 00:08:42,075
How do you believe we can afford this baby?

64
00:08:43,577 --> 00:08:46,747
I wash and cook for you everyday

65
00:08:47,206 --> 00:08:49,750
And I satisfy your desire at night

66
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,586
But you still forget our rice wine instead

67
00:08:52,669 --> 00:08:53,962
What kind of life is this?

68
00:08:54,338 --> 00:08:57,216
You tired of me? Want to chase me off?

69
00:08:57,716 --> 00:09:01,762
Ever since the day I moved in

70
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:05,974
I hate to live with a mute like you

71
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:08,518
I hate to live with a garbage man like you

72
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:24,553
You got clobbered, didn't you?

73
00:10:25,012 --> 00:10:27,806
Somebody gave him a fix

74
00:10:28,557 --> 00:10:29,433
Good morning, uncle

75
00:10:30,892 --> 00:10:33,186
Let me see your glasses, uncle

76
00:11:20,817 --> 00:11:25,197
Need something for your health? Rice wine?

77
00:11:27,074 --> 00:11:28,700
It stands to reason

78
00:11:57,437 --> 00:12:00,440
Take care, Chih-lan, bye-bye

79
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:41,064
Uncle

80
00:12:57,706 --> 00:12:59,666
But when I walked into this family

81
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:02,544
Our life changed all of a sudden

82
00:13:03,128 --> 00:13:06,214
I got a man I could depend on all my life

83
00:13:06,256 --> 00:13:09,176
But uncle lost his company who is his partner

84
00:13:09,259 --> 00:13:10,594
Auntie Chi-Ian

85
00:13:11,136 --> 00:13:14,139
I think it was my fault, wasn't it?

86
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,642
Because Auntie Chi-Ian tried her best...

87
00:13:17,642 --> 00:13:18,935
Just to love me and take care of me

88
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:21,730
But I was such a naughty child

89
00:13:22,105 --> 00:13:26,610
I made Auntie couldn't get any love from him

90
00:13:27,027 --> 00:13:30,780
Because uncle's given me almost everything

91
00:13:36,077 --> 00:13:39,080
Thanks for the applause

92
00:13:39,706 --> 00:13:42,584
Now it's the time for audience to perform

93
00:13:42,918 --> 00:13:44,878
Who wants to come up and perform?

94
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:47,631
Come on...

95
00:13:47,714 --> 00:13:49,549
Him! He can play a trumpet

96
00:13:50,634 --> 00:13:51,801
Let me hold the baby

97
00:13:52,052 --> 00:13:54,095
Right...go ahead

98
00:13:58,725 --> 00:14:01,853
He's damn good

99
00:15:49,085 --> 00:15:53,465
I once thought of that many times

100
00:15:53,923 --> 00:15:57,761
Me and my uncle actually had the same fate

101
00:15:58,678 --> 00:16:00,055
We both had been deserted

102
00:16:01,097 --> 00:16:02,140
I was deserted by who gave birth to me

103
00:16:02,599 --> 00:16:05,185
And the whole strenuous time deserted him

104
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:10,106
He'd once owned his parents and his family

105
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,525
And Auntie Chi-Ian

106
00:16:13,443 --> 00:16:14,569
But all of a sudden

107
00:16:15,153 --> 00:16:17,614
Nothing existed but his heart

108
00:16:18,114 --> 00:16:21,826
He might take me as his continuity of life

109
00:16:22,035 --> 00:16:24,287
Just like that chaos of my heart

110
00:16:24,537 --> 00:16:26,790
Took it as something couldn't take place

111
00:16:27,082 --> 00:16:29,209
Just like a supreme being in the days gone

112
00:16:29,668 --> 00:16:33,380
But we couldn't talk to each other with words

113
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:38,760
Worshipping your ancestors!

114
00:16:39,052 --> 00:16:42,347
Ah-mei

115
00:16:42,847 --> 00:16:45,016
Come to my house for New Year's dinner

116
00:16:46,017 --> 00:16:47,227
Be my guest

117
00:16:47,602 --> 00:16:49,938
Let's have a good drink today

118
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:52,357
You aren't doing me favor, are you?

119
00:16:53,566 --> 00:16:56,861
Take a look at Ah-mei, uncle

120
00:16:57,112 --> 00:17:00,365
Go tell Dad, Ah-mei

121
00:17:00,865 --> 00:17:03,201
Ah-mei, hurry up, go and tell Dad

122
00:17:03,368 --> 00:17:04,953
I wonder if she's mute too

123
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:08,456
What are you talking about?

124
00:17:12,252 --> 00:17:15,714
Ah-man's always a big mouth, don't be mad

125
00:17:17,716 --> 00:17:19,509
Let's go home

126
00:17:20,552 --> 00:17:22,637
Be sure to come over later, uncle

127
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:26,224
Until that day, it might be Ah-ming's hint

128
00:17:26,516 --> 00:17:28,935
Or it might be help from heaven

129
00:17:29,394 --> 00:17:30,562
My first word in my life is...

130
00:17:30,645 --> 00:17:31,980
Dad

131
00:17:37,777 --> 00:17:39,362
Dad

132
00:18:06,014 --> 00:18:08,141
This way, sit down please

133
00:18:10,351 --> 00:18:12,979
What happened? What did he say?

134
00:18:13,438 --> 00:18:15,899
Ah-mei can say Daddy

135
00:18:16,107 --> 00:18:17,901
A phoenix raised by a crow can talk

136
00:18:18,151 --> 00:18:19,360
Ah-mei knows how to say Daddy

137
00:18:19,611 --> 00:18:22,113
Now, say daddy

138
00:18:22,489 --> 00:18:24,908
Daddy

139
00:18:24,908 --> 00:18:26,493
Ah-mei, you're wonderful

140
00:18:56,272 --> 00:18:58,358
Mute

141
00:18:58,608 --> 00:18:59,609
Uncle

142
00:19:00,443 --> 00:19:02,028
Improving your mind!

143
00:19:10,745 --> 00:19:12,080
Come on

144
00:19:12,622 --> 00:19:15,124
It's winter beginning, let's have extra natty

145
00:19:15,542 --> 00:19:17,335
There's one dish my wife can't make

146
00:19:17,418 --> 00:19:18,628
Can you help with it?

147
00:19:24,843 --> 00:19:26,052
Dog meat!

148
00:19:51,703 --> 00:19:54,873
Sorry, doggie, I'll help you be reincarnated

149
00:19:54,956 --> 00:19:58,710
You'll belong to a foreign family

150
00:19:58,835 --> 00:20:00,753
That'll make your next life better

151
00:20:07,886 --> 00:20:11,431
There's a dog barking, whose dog is it?

152
00:20:13,182 --> 00:20:16,436
None of your business, go back your homework

153
00:20:17,729 --> 00:20:19,647
Just put it into the pan

154
00:20:23,484 --> 00:20:26,571
By the way...

155
00:20:28,781 --> 00:20:31,409
Where's the dog? Where did you put it?

156
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:32,744
Dad

157
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:40,585
How pitiful, there's blood all over its head

158
00:20:42,253 --> 00:20:44,797
Let's keep it, okay?

159
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:46,424
No, we want to eat it

160
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:48,092
Ah-mei

161
00:20:48,801 --> 00:20:51,721
Ah-ming, we've got a dog

162
00:20:52,138 --> 00:20:53,848
What a cute dog

163
00:20:55,975 --> 00:20:58,102
Why is its head all bloody?

164
00:20:58,394 --> 00:21:00,647
I don't know, somebody hit it, I guess

165
00:21:01,064 --> 00:21:03,441
Let's put some medicine on it

166
00:21:03,775 --> 00:21:04,567
Okay

167
00:21:05,109 --> 00:21:08,821
Easy, be careful

168
00:21:09,948 --> 00:21:12,367
Does it hurt when a dog's bleeding, Daddy?

169
00:21:12,784 --> 00:21:14,285
Nuts, of course it hurts

170
00:21:14,369 --> 00:21:15,328
I'm not asking you

171
00:21:15,411 --> 00:21:16,996
Yeah, she's not asking you

172
00:21:17,038 --> 00:21:18,081
You shut up

173
00:21:18,122 --> 00:21:18,915
What do you think you're doing?

174
00:21:22,543 --> 00:21:25,463
Meet me after school is over, okay?

175
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:29,175
Any bottle for sell?

176
00:21:32,011 --> 00:21:33,429
I want to get off

177
00:22:03,418 --> 00:22:05,503
Come on, Ah-mei

178
00:22:05,753 --> 00:22:08,214
Just tell me what the matter is

179
00:22:19,934 --> 00:22:21,686
Any bottle for sell?

180
00:22:23,354 --> 00:22:26,524
How dare you push and bite me,
I'll show you back

181
00:22:26,566 --> 00:22:27,734
Look, Ah-ming

182
00:22:27,984 --> 00:22:30,486
What're you doing, Liu Chun-chieh? Stop

183
00:22:30,778 --> 00:22:32,739
Come back, Liu Chun-chieh

184
00:22:32,822 --> 00:22:34,866
Ah-ming, don't let him get away

185
00:22:45,918 --> 00:22:46,919
Ah-ming

186
00:22:47,336 --> 00:22:48,504
Ah-ming

187
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:53,676
Ah-ming

188
00:22:55,803 --> 00:22:56,596
Ah-ming

189
00:22:59,932 --> 00:23:00,725
Ah-ming

190
00:23:01,434 --> 00:23:02,518
Ah-ming

191
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:05,480
Ah-ming, look

192
00:23:06,397 --> 00:23:07,106
Ah-mei

193
00:23:07,899 --> 00:23:08,775
Ah-mei

194
00:23:11,444 --> 00:23:14,906
Go, go, Lau-fu

195
00:23:15,239 --> 00:23:16,532
Lai-fu

196
00:23:17,867 --> 00:23:21,537
Bite hime to death

197
00:23:21,913 --> 00:23:22,997
Lai-fu

198
00:23:24,207 --> 00:23:27,835
Lai-fu, kill him

199
00:23:28,669 --> 00:23:29,837
You're great, Lai-fu

200
00:23:30,046 --> 00:23:32,173
Good boy, Lai-fu

201
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,553
Good boy, Lai-fu
Is it dead?

202
00:23:37,595 --> 00:23:38,888
I don't know

203
00:23:42,975 --> 00:23:44,560
Is it dead anyway?

204
00:23:44,727 --> 00:23:45,561
It's dead

205
00:23:51,984 --> 00:23:53,027
Mom

206
00:23:53,277 --> 00:23:55,696
Just drop it
What's wrong?

207
00:23:57,865 --> 00:24:03,287
Come on, it's a kid

208
00:24:04,997 --> 00:24:06,541
Don't do that again

209
00:24:06,666 --> 00:24:07,500
Okay

210
00:24:08,584 --> 00:24:11,087
Good, over two catties

211
00:24:18,886 --> 00:24:21,389
Come on, take it easy

212
00:24:22,932 --> 00:24:25,893
It scared you, so you can eat it

213
00:24:25,977 --> 00:24:27,061
No, I don't

214
00:24:39,198 --> 00:24:42,702
Is it poisonous? Isn't it?

215
00:24:42,994 --> 00:24:46,372
Don't know till we eat it, have some, mute

216
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,591
Eat

217
00:25:01,596 --> 00:25:03,014
What's the matter with you? Dad

218
00:25:03,264 --> 00:25:05,349
What's the matter, Dad?

219
00:25:05,725 --> 00:25:07,059
Dad

220
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:17,403
You never know when to come
in once you come out

221
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:19,447
Like a rag in a stream

222
00:25:24,994 --> 00:25:26,245
What are you sneaking around for?

223
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:32,418
Fooling around all day long

224
00:25:35,004 --> 00:25:39,800
It's okay, just tell me about it

225
00:25:43,262 --> 00:25:44,805
I brought this to Ah-mei

226
00:25:55,858 --> 00:25:57,360
Thank you!

227
00:25:57,401 --> 00:25:59,528
Shame on you, a man loves a woman

228
00:26:03,532 --> 00:26:04,742
What about mine?

229
00:26:06,619 --> 00:26:08,162
No more

230
00:26:09,121 --> 00:26:10,289
Stingy

231
00:26:10,456 --> 00:26:12,667
No, you're stingy

232
00:26:12,917 --> 00:26:14,418
Why don't you give me a present?

233
00:26:14,502 --> 00:26:16,712
I've got no money to buy toys for you

234
00:26:16,754 --> 00:26:19,423
He is an adult, he should buy me something

235
00:26:19,548 --> 00:26:20,508
Shame on you

236
00:26:20,549 --> 00:26:21,425
No, you're shameless

237
00:26:21,592 --> 00:26:24,303
Stop it, just listen to me

238
00:26:24,387 --> 00:26:26,847
Ah-ming, Ah-kun, one car for each

239
00:26:27,223 --> 00:26:28,641
A doll for Ah-mei

240
00:26:28,724 --> 00:26:30,226
A wool hat for mute

241
00:26:31,352 --> 00:26:32,687
A necklace for Mom

242
00:26:33,062 --> 00:26:34,313
Money... money

243
00:26:36,148 --> 00:26:37,149
What are you doing now?

244
00:26:37,525 --> 00:26:39,568
Nothing, I think I've got some luck today

245
00:26:39,944 --> 00:26:40,945
I'm taking it

246
00:26:41,195 --> 00:26:46,450
That money belongs to somebody else

247
00:26:46,826 --> 00:26:48,202
Give it to me

248
00:26:48,286 --> 00:26:50,621
I'll be back soon tonight

249
00:26:50,871 --> 00:26:52,039
I'll give it back twice as much as this amount

250
00:26:52,373 --> 00:26:55,751
Why must you gamble? It's dangerous

251
00:26:55,876 --> 00:26:58,462
Go to hell

252
00:26:58,504 --> 00:27:02,675
Take it all

253
00:27:03,634 --> 00:27:06,470
Bets...or you're a coward

254
00:27:17,315 --> 00:27:20,443
I've lost so much, I should win once

255
00:27:20,901 --> 00:27:24,739
Everything depends on this

256
00:27:26,490 --> 00:27:30,119
You always rant at my gambling

257
00:27:30,453 --> 00:27:33,205
I'll stop your mouth with a gold necklace

258
00:27:33,998 --> 00:27:38,627
And I'll make you call me darling tonight

259
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:19,126
Go home, you've read that a hundred times

260
00:28:19,251 --> 00:28:20,169
None of your business

261
00:28:20,628 --> 00:28:21,504
I'm not going back

262
00:28:21,837 --> 00:28:22,630
You keep out of this

263
00:28:39,563 --> 00:28:41,357
Pretty, dolly, you've run away?

264
00:28:43,943 --> 00:28:45,528
Went swimming

265
00:28:47,196 --> 00:28:49,448
Come back...

266
00:28:50,699 --> 00:28:53,869
Come back...

267
00:28:59,708 --> 00:29:05,464
You won't get away, come back

268
00:29:12,346 --> 00:29:19,145
Auntie, come on, oh, my God

269
00:29:20,104 --> 00:29:23,983
He's by the gutter, Ah-man

270
00:29:24,525 --> 00:29:25,401
Ah-man...

271
00:29:25,651 --> 00:29:26,444
Auntie...

272
00:29:26,527 --> 00:29:28,154
Sister...

273
00:29:39,915 --> 00:29:42,168
Ah-man...

274
00:29:42,585 --> 00:29:44,336
Ah-man...

275
00:29:49,842 --> 00:29:50,676
Ah-man...

276
00:30:23,334 --> 00:30:30,591
Must you torture me this way?

277
00:30:32,384 --> 00:30:36,055
That makes you happy, doesn't it?

278
00:30:48,901 --> 00:30:54,573
I didn't really mean to scold you

279
00:30:55,241 --> 00:30:56,617
You know that?

280
00:30:59,745 --> 00:31:02,915
I didn't really want you to die

281
00:31:03,165 --> 00:31:04,208
Auntie's house is on fire

282
00:31:06,043 --> 00:31:09,588
I didn't want you to die...

283
00:31:10,172 --> 00:31:12,174
Auntie, come on and go home

284
00:31:13,050 --> 00:31:15,135
House will burn down if you still stay here

285
00:31:15,511 --> 00:31:18,013
The house will burn down if you still stay here

286
00:31:19,181 --> 00:31:20,474
You silly brother still sleeps in it

287
00:31:20,808 --> 00:31:23,602
What will you do if he's burned?

288
00:31:34,029 --> 00:31:35,281
Ah-mei

289
00:31:39,368 --> 00:31:40,077
Ah-mei

290
00:31:40,411 --> 00:31:46,166
Ah-mei

291
00:32:16,155 --> 00:32:19,033
Ah-mei, wait a minute

292
00:32:38,594 --> 00:32:39,762
Dad...

293
00:32:42,848 --> 00:32:44,767
Dad...

294
00:32:45,851 --> 00:32:51,690
Mom, let me go, I want to find my Mom

295
00:32:53,651 --> 00:32:55,653
Mom...

296
00:32:55,944 --> 00:32:57,237
Mom...

297
00:32:58,280 --> 00:33:01,450
My little baby, don't cry, Mon's here

298
00:33:01,909 --> 00:33:04,662
Mom...

299
00:33:06,038 --> 00:33:09,416
Mom...

300
00:33:10,626 --> 00:33:13,629
Mom...

301
00:33:34,108 --> 00:33:35,984
Dad...

302
00:33:37,319 --> 00:33:41,573
Hat hot and fierce light, shadow of death

303
00:33:42,074 --> 00:33:46,370
Helpless crying and miserable look from Auntie

304
00:33:46,745 --> 00:33:50,082
Seems like it became a memory of my childhood

305
00:33:50,624 --> 00:33:53,669
Though terrible fire burned everything up

306
00:33:54,002 --> 00:33:55,671
It couldn't burn our hope

307
00:33:56,088 --> 00:33:58,173
People have to go on living anyway

308
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:01,844
Misery makes a man forget about yesterday

309
00:34:02,177 --> 00:34:04,847
It makes people live in today's fatigue

310
00:34:05,973 --> 00:34:09,810
No matter how fast time would pass

311
00:34:10,018 --> 00:34:13,439
Everyday to us is the same

312
00:34:13,897 --> 00:34:17,609
The same neighbors and friends, the same work

313
00:34:18,861 --> 00:34:19,862
Until one day...

314
00:34:20,487 --> 00:34:25,951
Suddenly I found something
white in my father's head

315
00:34:26,410 --> 00:34:30,539
Then I found that I'm grown up

316
00:34:31,081 --> 00:34:34,001
And a strange now world has tied us together

317
00:34:34,084 --> 00:34:37,838
So secretly and so tightly

318
00:34:44,762 --> 00:34:46,096
Come on, little mouse

319
00:34:46,430 --> 00:34:50,309
It's not a marriage with Ah-mei

320
00:34:51,727 --> 00:34:53,520
Shut up or I'll fix you

321
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,357
You bought that much food for a feast?

322
00:34:57,357 --> 00:35:00,152
To celebrate her first day at work

323
00:35:02,321 --> 00:35:07,075
Ah-ming's more anxious than she is

324
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:10,370
Look, uncle

325
00:35:10,454 --> 00:35:11,330
Uncle

326
00:35:18,754 --> 00:35:20,464
It's okay, I've made some extra money today

327
00:35:20,672 --> 00:35:21,548
Don't get mad, Uncle

328
00:35:22,007 --> 00:35:23,884
You'd run into another rich window, didn't you?

329
00:35:24,301 --> 00:35:26,345
Don't talk nonsense,
I've got nothing to do with her

330
00:35:26,678 --> 00:35:28,680
I only say that she's beautiful

331
00:35:29,097 --> 00:35:29,848
Is she beautiful

332
00:35:30,224 --> 00:35:32,601
Sure she is, beautiful as you

333
00:35:33,018 --> 00:35:36,522
When does Ah-mei finish her work?

334
00:35:36,814 --> 00:35:40,526
Let me make some dishes for our snack

335
00:35:48,283 --> 00:35:56,583
Give me a ray of warming light

336
00:35:59,169 --> 00:36:09,972
Don't maintain that you're in a stupor

337
00:36:10,889 --> 00:36:21,400
Dance with me to our heart's desire

338
00:36:22,234 --> 00:36:32,828
How much loneliness does a stranger have

339
00:36:38,250 --> 00:36:41,503
Listen again-ding dong, ding dong

340
00:36:41,628 --> 00:36:45,132
How the distant notes pierce my heart

341
00:36:45,173 --> 00:36:48,677
Sing again - do be do wa

342
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:52,222
Feeling of sorrow if you'd like to stimulate

343
00:37:30,427 --> 00:37:31,929
I'll take you home, okay?

344
00:37:34,765 --> 00:37:36,308
I didn't mean it just now

345
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:38,268
But it's true you don't sing well

346
00:37:45,734 --> 00:37:47,945
Don't be angry, act like a lady

347
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,113
You want me to lie about your singing?

348
00:37:50,155 --> 00:37:51,239
Wouldn't that be pretty vain?

349
00:37:52,032 --> 00:37:54,409
Okay, you sing very well, better than anybody

350
00:37:54,743 --> 00:37:56,078
Even better than Teresa Teng, satisfy?

351
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,497
You have no right to criticize me

352
00:37:58,914 --> 00:38:00,040
True, I have no right

353
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,959
But I can tell if you sing well or not

354
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:04,836
I'm a composer, I can give you some advice

355
00:38:18,475 --> 00:38:20,185
You car

356
00:38:20,769 --> 00:38:23,814
It's okay, too bad for the owner, though

357
00:38:23,939 --> 00:38:24,940
Get in

358
00:38:46,962 --> 00:38:49,047
Later on the song became a hit

359
00:38:56,346 --> 00:38:58,181
I'm home, Dad

360
00:38:58,682 --> 00:39:01,893
<i>Dad, he's Shin Chun-mai, a song writer</i>

361
00:39:02,102 --> 00:39:03,103
My Dad

362
00:39:05,564 --> 00:39:07,274
Don't be so rude, Dai-fu

363
00:39:12,362 --> 00:39:13,780
Want to come to my house and sit for a while

364
00:39:14,156 --> 00:39:16,533
No...there'll be opportunities later

365
00:39:16,825 --> 00:39:17,617
Good-bye

366
00:39:25,125 --> 00:39:26,418
Let's go home, Lai-fu

367
00:39:26,626 --> 00:39:27,502
Let's go, Dad

368
00:39:27,794 --> 00:39:30,005
<i>That Shin Chun-mai I just mentioned, Dad</i>

369
00:39:30,130 --> 00:39:31,798
He said he's got some new songs

370
00:39:31,798 --> 00:39:34,426
Which fits me and he
wants to teach me personally

371
00:39:34,509 --> 00:39:35,552
I'm so happy

372
00:39:36,595 --> 00:39:37,804
Dad, you know something

373
00:39:38,180 --> 00:39:39,264
I like singing very much

374
00:39:46,938 --> 00:39:47,814
Here it is

375
00:39:51,651 --> 00:39:56,865
Go ahead, Dad

376
00:39:58,158 --> 00:40:00,869
Drinking so early, you are not driving, are you?

377
00:40:01,203 --> 00:40:02,204
Leave me alone, Mom

378
00:40:02,454 --> 00:40:03,413
What do you think you are?

379
00:40:03,663 --> 00:40:06,249
Much of us have lived here for thirty years

380
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:09,044
Where did you have us move to?

381
00:40:09,336 --> 00:40:11,004
Please give a fin comment, you guys

382
00:40:11,254 --> 00:40:12,547
Where did you want us move to?

383
00:40:12,798 --> 00:40:15,050
To Green Island?

384
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:18,553
What's the matter, Auntie?

385
00:40:18,678 --> 00:40:20,263
The illegal building must be torn down

386
00:40:20,388 --> 00:40:23,433
The government will make up for you

387
00:40:23,725 --> 00:40:26,853
What a joke

388
00:40:27,229 --> 00:40:30,190
Money is only enough
to buy two pieces of candy

389
00:40:30,607 --> 00:40:32,150
What do you take me for, a child?

390
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:35,403
You have preference for government housing

391
00:40:35,403 --> 00:40:38,198
Preference? It'll still take a year or more

392
00:40:38,490 --> 00:40:39,366
Stand still

393
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:43,578
Listen, I just work for the government

394
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:45,872
I live here too the same as you guys

395
00:40:45,956 --> 00:40:47,040
Just like us

396
00:40:47,124 --> 00:40:49,292
The government preference and have priority

397
00:40:49,501 --> 00:40:50,293
The government will protect only those
who are the same

398
00:40:50,502 --> 00:40:51,378
How can you tell other people to move

399
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:53,547
Such a man like him needs a good lesson

400
00:40:53,839 --> 00:40:56,258
A bunch of mad dogs, I'm telling you...

401
00:40:56,299 --> 00:40:58,718
If you don't move out, I'll get rough with you

402
00:40:59,052 --> 00:41:01,221
What do you mean by that? get rough with us

403
00:41:01,429 --> 00:41:02,472
Don't run away

404
00:41:02,597 --> 00:41:03,348
Beat him

405
00:41:03,348 --> 00:41:05,308
Why me? I want to beat somebody too

406
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:09,187
I wanted to beat somebody last night

407
00:41:09,521 --> 00:41:10,480
Come back

408
00:41:11,314 --> 00:41:12,107
Wait a minute...

409
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,859
I told you to come in, let' go

410
00:41:23,076 --> 00:41:25,787
Don't be unhappy, Dad

411
00:41:25,912 --> 00:41:29,207
Our house isn't the only one to be torn down

412
00:41:29,374 --> 00:41:31,459
Anyway, we'll have to move

413
00:41:34,671 --> 00:41:38,258
Don't worry about the money, Dad

414
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:41,595
I'll make a lot of money for you to buy a house

415
00:41:58,195 --> 00:42:04,117
I walk with unvarying footsteps

416
00:42:04,451 --> 00:42:10,207
Waiting for your coming

417
00:42:10,874 --> 00:42:17,047
When you have anxiety and doubt

418
00:42:17,547 --> 00:42:23,011
Please come with me

419
00:42:23,511 --> 00:42:29,517
I carry a dreamlike hope

420
00:42:29,935 --> 00:42:35,273
A feeling that can't be repressed

421
00:42:35,774 --> 00:42:42,030
When you are distracted

422
00:42:42,656 --> 00:42:48,536
Please come with me

423
00:42:51,706 --> 00:43:04,302
It's world you cannot foresee

424
00:43:05,804 --> 00:43:11,434
You don't have to say anything

425
00:43:11,476 --> 00:43:16,815
Your eyes have already told me

426
00:43:23,863 --> 00:43:30,036
When spring showers are drifting down

427
00:43:30,495 --> 00:43:35,709
And dripping endlessly from your hair

428
00:43:36,626 --> 00:43:42,799
Wear your crystal pearl necklace

429
00:43:43,341 --> 00:43:49,222
Please come with me

430
00:44:01,985 --> 00:44:14,539
It's world you cannot foresee

431
00:44:16,082 --> 00:44:19,294
You don't have to say anything

432
00:44:21,588 --> 00:44:27,802
Your eyes have already told me

433
00:44:34,267 --> 00:44:40,398
When spring showers are drifting down

434
00:44:40,815 --> 00:44:46,071
And dripping endlessly from your hair

435
00:44:47,113 --> 00:44:53,244
Wear your crystal pearl necklace

436
00:44:53,703 --> 00:44:59,918
Please come with me

437
00:45:18,937 --> 00:45:19,813
I hope you could

438
00:45:20,146 --> 00:45:22,399
The Manager Yu of Kuang Tail wants to see you

439
00:45:24,359 --> 00:45:27,362
Don't be afraid, he has no interest in you

440
00:45:27,445 --> 00:45:29,155
He has interest only in men

441
00:45:31,282 --> 00:45:32,492
Let me introduce...

442
00:45:32,742 --> 00:45:36,329
I know her, she's the famous singer star, Shen-ni

443
00:45:36,454 --> 00:45:38,164
I like your singing very much

444
00:45:38,498 --> 00:45:39,749
Thank you!

445
00:45:39,749 --> 00:45:41,626
<i>This is my friend Shin Chun-mai</i>

446
00:45:41,918 --> 00:45:46,089
I knew each other before, I'm her manager

447
00:45:46,464 --> 00:45:50,051
I just heard you sang, you'll have a good future

448
00:45:51,428 --> 00:45:52,762
Here's my name card

449
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:56,724
I'd like to talk to you tomorrow

450
00:46:00,228 --> 00:46:04,441
When will my next record be released?

451
00:46:05,358 --> 00:46:08,319
Your last record didn't sell well

452
00:46:08,445 --> 00:46:12,031
I think you'd better offer some shows nowadays

453
00:46:12,073 --> 00:46:13,450
Manager, Miss Shen's here

454
00:46:18,204 --> 00:46:20,415
I've got something to discuss with you

455
00:46:20,665 --> 00:46:22,167
You leave for a while, okay?

456
00:46:25,295 --> 00:46:26,504
Sister Shen

457
00:46:34,345 --> 00:46:36,806
I hope you could take Shen-ni's place

458
00:46:36,848 --> 00:46:37,765
Why?

459
00:46:38,016 --> 00:46:41,019
The audience needs some
new excitements, new faces

460
00:46:41,060 --> 00:46:44,606
They tired of Shen-ni now

461
00:46:44,981 --> 00:46:46,774
Your qualifications are better

462
00:46:47,192 --> 00:46:48,568
Do you think I'm qualified?

463
00:46:48,610 --> 00:46:50,236
Do you think she's qualified?

464
00:46:50,612 --> 00:46:53,948
She was a dancer, she couldn't speak Chinese

465
00:46:54,073 --> 00:46:56,826
The qualifications depend on me, not you

466
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:58,495
You just do whatever I tell you...

467
00:46:58,828 --> 00:47:00,955
And you'll be bigger than she is

468
00:47:02,248 --> 00:47:04,000
Okay, I agree

469
00:47:04,918 --> 00:47:05,835
But I have a requirement

470
00:47:06,252 --> 00:47:07,420
What's that?

471
00:47:08,046 --> 00:47:09,589
I want him to compose for me

472
00:47:13,927 --> 00:47:17,055
<i>Mr. Shin, I'm sorry, I have 10 tell you the true</i>

473
00:47:17,388 --> 00:47:19,724
What we need are commercial songs

474
00:47:19,891 --> 00:47:22,769
Not those folk songs, like yours

475
00:47:23,770 --> 00:47:25,939
That's what I insist, Miss Sun

476
00:47:26,439 --> 00:47:27,607
I hope you'll think it over

477
00:47:27,690 --> 00:47:28,858
What does he think he is?

478
00:47:28,942 --> 00:47:30,318
Gay, a shark, vulgar

479
00:47:30,610 --> 00:47:32,862
None of Shen-ni's songs has class

480
00:47:33,112 --> 00:47:34,781
Would I write those stupid songs?

481
00:47:35,156 --> 00:47:36,950
I don't care these money he earned

482
00:47:36,991 --> 00:47:38,576
If you like him, go with him

483
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:41,162
I just want to make more money
and buy my father a house

484
00:47:41,204 --> 00:47:42,497
That'll make him a better life

485
00:47:42,789 --> 00:47:44,082
Am I doing wrong?

486
00:47:44,374 --> 00:47:47,210
I you don't like it,
I'll give him a call right now

487
00:48:02,225 --> 00:48:03,893
Maybe you should go along with him

488
00:48:17,031 --> 00:48:19,367
Okay, thanks for your trouble, Miss Yuen

489
00:48:19,492 --> 00:48:20,326
It's nothing, nothing

490
00:48:22,120 --> 00:48:23,496
Now we've finished the first step

491
00:48:23,955 --> 00:48:25,999
And the second is to change your name

492
00:48:26,332 --> 00:48:27,500
Change my name?

493
00:48:27,584 --> 00:48:29,919
Yes, just like making a new person

494
00:48:30,295 --> 00:48:33,840
From now on your name is Sun Jui-chi

495
00:48:34,173 --> 00:48:36,009
Sun Jui-chi

496
00:48:36,134 --> 00:48:39,220
By the way, I've rent
a very comfortable room for you

497
00:48:39,304 --> 00:48:40,722
You can move in tomorrow

498
00:48:40,722 --> 00:48:41,639
Why?

499
00:48:42,098 --> 00:48:45,685
Because I want to make you a star of all stars

500
00:48:45,977 --> 00:48:47,562
I'll inform the mass media

501
00:48:47,895 --> 00:48:50,815
You grow up from a wealthy and cultured family

502
00:48:51,274 --> 00:48:53,776
And make you full of the manner of a fine lady

503
00:48:54,402 --> 00:48:57,864
Something the audience can see, not touched

504
00:48:57,905 --> 00:49:00,408
You're allowing Ah-mei to move out

505
00:49:00,658 --> 00:49:02,577
It's dangerous to be a singer these days

506
00:49:02,827 --> 00:49:04,996
Rich men are always after them

507
00:49:05,955 --> 00:49:08,541
It won't do, you say it, mouse

508
00:49:08,666 --> 00:49:09,834
Okay

509
00:49:11,169 --> 00:49:13,463
You collect newspaper everyday

510
00:49:13,546 --> 00:49:15,173
Don't you read what's in them?

511
00:49:15,465 --> 00:49:18,384
Bad guys like to abduct singers

512
00:49:18,468 --> 00:49:21,054
Take their clothes off and photograph them

513
00:49:21,095 --> 00:49:23,389
Like that Spin-up Girl case

514
00:49:23,681 --> 00:49:24,641
It's really

515
00:49:25,433 --> 00:49:27,935
An-ming, I said what you wanted

516
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:31,356
What's wrong to be a star?

517
00:49:31,606 --> 00:49:34,942
Get famous and find a rich man

518
00:49:34,942 --> 00:49:37,862
You'll have more money than rice

519
00:49:38,404 --> 00:49:42,533
Uncle will have everything then

520
00:49:42,617 --> 00:49:43,493
That's right

521
00:49:43,534 --> 00:49:45,662
Then she won't recognize her own father

522
00:49:46,037 --> 00:49:48,039
I don't think Ah-mei's like that

523
00:49:50,124 --> 00:49:53,336
Don't be silly, Ah-ming

524
00:49:53,753 --> 00:49:56,005
She just wants to make some money

525
00:50:03,179 --> 00:50:04,514
Dad, I'm back

526
00:50:05,598 --> 00:50:07,058
My stuff is there

527
00:50:07,934 --> 00:50:11,813
Your father is waiting so long,
for having dinner with you

528
00:50:12,855 --> 00:50:14,691
I can't eat at home, Dad

529
00:50:15,066 --> 00:50:16,401
The company's arranged a party

530
00:50:16,693 --> 00:50:18,736
With reporters and the record company boss

531
00:50:19,153 --> 00:50:20,530
I have to practice singing after dinner

532
00:50:21,614 --> 00:50:24,701
But I'll come and see you often, Dad

533
00:50:24,742 --> 00:50:25,785
Good-bye

534
00:51:21,340 --> 00:51:27,138
When did the frog croaks become memory

535
00:51:27,764 --> 00:51:33,811
When did the land become so crowded

536
00:51:34,479 --> 00:51:40,318
With tall buildings towering all around

537
00:51:41,110 --> 00:51:49,035
And neon signs making the night so harsh

538
00:51:50,578 --> 00:51:56,375
Who can tell me? Who can tell?

539
00:51:56,834 --> 00:51:59,712
Did we change the world

540
00:51:59,754 --> 00:52:06,886
Or did the world change you and me?

541
00:52:09,889 --> 00:52:12,141
The same moonlight

542
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:17,939
Shines on the same Hsintien River

543
00:52:18,439 --> 00:52:22,026
The same winter

544
00:52:22,318 --> 00:52:27,323
Brings the same cold rains

545
00:52:28,407 --> 00:52:31,452
The same dust

546
00:52:31,744 --> 00:52:37,917
Is blown by the same wind

547
00:52:38,584 --> 00:52:41,879
The same smiles

548
00:52:42,171 --> 00:52:45,258
The same tears

549
00:52:45,341 --> 00:52:46,717
The same days

550
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:52,682
The same you and me

551
00:52:53,266 --> 00:52:56,185
The same smiles

552
00:52:56,477 --> 00:52:59,647
The same tears

553
00:52:59,730 --> 00:53:01,482
The same days

554
00:53:01,607 --> 00:53:07,822
The same you and me

555
00:53:20,418 --> 00:53:22,378
Ah-ming's really beautiful

556
00:53:26,299 --> 00:53:27,675
Sounds really good

557
00:53:27,717 --> 00:53:30,428
You don't have to worry now, do you?

558
00:53:30,803 --> 00:53:33,556
See? Ah-ming's really wonderful

559
00:53:34,140 --> 00:53:37,226
She'll be a very popular singer

560
00:53:47,028 --> 00:53:48,362
Thank you, thank you

561
00:53:49,906 --> 00:53:52,533
I hear you grew up on a wealthy family

562
00:53:52,867 --> 00:53:54,327
What business is your father in?

563
00:53:54,827 --> 00:53:55,620
My father...

564
00:53:55,870 --> 00:53:57,788
Her father's a big contractor

565
00:53:57,830 --> 00:53:59,874
He's emigrated to America now

566
00:54:00,207 --> 00:54:02,209
Only Miss Sun is left here

567
00:54:03,419 --> 00:54:06,839
How do you make a living here, Miss Sun

568
00:54:06,923 --> 00:54:09,008
It depends on my manager's arrangement

569
00:54:09,050 --> 00:54:12,219
She stars a Southeast Asian tour tomorrow

570
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:13,971
She'll be back in a month

571
00:54:14,388 --> 00:54:17,892
The she'll have the biggest concert here

572
00:54:18,768 --> 00:54:20,645
Let me ask an irrelevant question?

573
00:54:20,728 --> 00:54:22,647
Do you have a close boy friend?

574
00:54:25,816 --> 00:54:27,443
Well? Do you?

575
00:54:30,363 --> 00:54:33,282
Yes, a lot of them, my listeners

576
00:54:33,324 --> 00:54:34,617
My listeners are my closest friends

577
00:54:43,167 --> 00:54:46,671
You aren't well, shouldn't come out

578
00:54:52,259 --> 00:54:53,803
Ah-mei's gone too far

579
00:54:53,844 --> 00:54:56,222
Only coming back so rarely to see you

580
00:54:56,722 --> 00:55:01,435
Not asking you to her press conference

581
00:55:01,477 --> 00:55:02,937
When I see her, I'll ask her about that

582
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:14,156
What's the matter with you?

583
00:55:20,663 --> 00:55:22,832
Aren't you that great singer, Shen-ni?

584
00:55:24,583 --> 00:55:28,421
Yes, I'm that great singer

585
00:55:28,421 --> 00:55:31,590
Why? You want my antograph

586
00:55:34,677 --> 00:55:35,761
Give me a pen

587
00:55:36,220 --> 00:55:39,932
I'm not your friend, I came to see Ah-mei

588
00:55:40,433 --> 00:55:42,268
Who's Ah-mei?

589
00:55:43,269 --> 00:55:45,062
Ah-mei's Sun Jui-chi

590
00:55:45,688 --> 00:55:47,732
Sun Jui-chi

591
00:55:50,901 --> 00:55:52,528
What's so great about her?

592
00:55:53,070 --> 00:55:55,239
How can her singing compare with mine?

593
00:55:57,283 --> 00:56:00,327
She's just younger and prettier, that's all

594
00:56:01,912 --> 00:56:06,417
Nobody's young and pretty forever

595
00:56:07,043 --> 00:56:12,173
Anyway one day she'll fall

596
00:56:12,506 --> 00:56:14,842
Then she'll never come up again

597
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:17,970
Be careful about what you say

598
00:56:18,387 --> 00:56:21,599
So what? What's she to you?

599
00:56:21,891 --> 00:56:23,934
I'm her neighbor, that's all

600
00:56:24,226 --> 00:56:25,269
He's her father

601
00:56:29,857 --> 00:56:34,028
He's her father? That's laugh

602
00:56:34,278 --> 00:56:36,197
It's true, he's really her father

603
00:56:40,076 --> 00:56:44,121
Attention, everybody, quiet, please

604
00:56:44,580 --> 00:56:48,209
I have some good news for you

605
00:56:48,709 --> 00:56:51,587
He's Sun Jui-chi's father

606
00:56:51,879 --> 00:56:54,507
Her father, just back from America

607
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:59,553
The big contractor, back from America

608
00:57:00,012 --> 00:57:03,432
See? That's the way it is

609
00:57:06,727 --> 00:57:09,063
He isn't her father, folks

610
00:57:10,147 --> 00:57:12,399
Does he look like him?

611
00:57:12,775 --> 00:57:15,402
They're just enthusiastic fans

612
00:57:15,528 --> 00:57:17,822
What? He's really her father

613
00:57:17,905 --> 00:57:19,156
You're trying to pull a fast one?

614
00:57:19,281 --> 00:57:21,450
You're the fraud

615
00:57:23,327 --> 00:57:25,371
Tell them, Ah-mei

616
00:57:25,371 --> 00:57:28,666
Isn't he your father? Speak up

617
00:57:30,251 --> 00:57:33,379
See? Even he doesn't say it

618
00:57:33,671 --> 00:57:36,507
If they're not frauds, what are they?

619
00:57:36,549 --> 00:57:38,008
Ah-mei, come here

620
00:57:38,342 --> 00:57:40,386
Tel them he's your father

621
00:57:40,678 --> 00:57:41,720
Why don't you speak up?

622
00:57:47,601 --> 00:57:49,937
No, Ah-mei, please

623
00:57:53,399 --> 00:57:55,276
Listen to me, just this once

624
00:58:26,432 --> 00:58:28,976
Dad, I'm sorry

625
00:58:32,062 --> 00:58:34,815
It's too late to say that now

626
00:58:34,899 --> 00:58:37,443
You're popular and you despite us now

627
00:58:37,693 --> 00:58:38,611
Who despite you?

628
00:58:38,652 --> 00:58:40,404
Don't say silly things, Ah-ming

629
00:58:40,696 --> 00:58:44,241
Me said silly things? Dame you

630
00:58:44,325 --> 00:58:45,284
Don't be that way

631
00:58:45,367 --> 00:58:47,328
Over 20 years and this is what I get

632
00:58:47,620 --> 00:58:49,663
I really don't despise you

633
00:58:49,747 --> 00:58:51,916
You're star, we're not on the level as high as you

634
00:58:51,999 --> 00:58:52,917
No...

635
00:58:53,209 --> 00:58:54,418
Ah-ming, don't talk so much

636
00:58:54,627 --> 00:58:55,502
You can go now

637
00:58:55,794 --> 00:58:57,296
You don't belong here

638
00:58:57,588 --> 00:58:58,714
We can get along without you

639
00:58:58,964 --> 00:59:00,007
You're just a foundling, anyway

640
00:59:00,049 --> 00:59:02,009
Are you finished, Ah-ming?

641
00:59:12,353 --> 00:59:14,063
Ah-mei

642
00:59:14,688 --> 00:59:16,732
Ah-mei

643
01:01:13,766 --> 01:01:15,601
I watched Ah-mei grow up

644
01:01:16,018 --> 01:01:20,230
She isn't like that, I believe in her...

645
01:01:20,522 --> 01:01:23,984
Stop drinking, your high blood pressure

646
01:02:03,857 --> 01:02:06,652
Ah-mei, we may have loved once

647
01:02:07,152 --> 01:02:11,281
But love and friendship are different

648
01:02:11,782 --> 01:02:13,826
You know what I mean

649
01:02:14,326 --> 01:02:18,872
Sorry, I'm leaving, Shi Chun-mai

650
01:02:19,832 --> 01:02:25,796
Think how the earth shook when we met

651
01:02:26,213 --> 01:02:35,556
And then the changes, like passing mists

652
01:02:39,101 --> 01:02:44,773
As the seasons change in he heavens

653
01:02:45,232 --> 01:02:50,654
You wander without end

654
01:02:52,781 --> 01:02:57,453
Under the sky with its traveling orbs People
will entertainment you in Singapore and Hong Kong

655
01:02:57,578 --> 01:02:59,246
I can't leave here

656
01:02:59,246 --> 01:03:01,540
I can take care of myself

657
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:04,918
Okay, good luck on your tour

658
01:03:05,794 --> 01:03:09,256
Don't forget, give Dad two hundred thousand

659
01:03:09,548 --> 01:03:11,091
He needs it to buy a house

660
01:03:11,508 --> 01:03:13,385
Okay, I'll send it to him

661
01:03:13,719 --> 01:03:15,220
Thanks, good-bye

662
01:03:16,013 --> 01:03:20,100
I'll cast aside unwanted memories

663
01:03:21,560 --> 01:03:34,156
Far away, they lose their mystery

664
01:03:35,824 --> 01:03:42,498
Think how the earth shook when we met

665
01:03:42,748 --> 01:03:52,174
And then the changes, like passing mists

666
01:04:15,197 --> 01:04:21,328
As the seasons change in the heavens

667
01:04:21,828 --> 01:04:27,668
You wander without end

668
01:04:28,669 --> 01:04:34,758
Under the sky with its traveling orbs

669
01:04:35,133 --> 01:04:41,014
In a gauss like haze

670
01:04:42,057 --> 01:04:47,729
I was careless, lost my love

671
01:04:47,980 --> 01:04:51,608
Much to my regret

672
01:04:51,984 --> 01:04:57,197
I'll cast aside unwanted memories

673
01:04:57,531 --> 01:05:10,627
Far away, they lose their mystery

674
01:05:11,670 --> 01:05:18,802
Think how the earth shook when we met

675
01:05:19,094 --> 01:05:28,562
And then the changes, like passing mists

676
01:05:31,773 --> 01:05:38,864
Think how the earth shook when we met

677
01:05:39,114 --> 01:05:48,498
And then the changes, like passing mists

678
01:05:50,709 --> 01:05:52,961
When thunder-like applause came

679
01:05:53,295 --> 01:05:55,672
I knew it was all mine

680
01:05:56,006 --> 01:05:58,300
I should be moved and excited

681
01:05:58,967 --> 01:06:01,053
But nobody knows that...

682
01:06:01,470 --> 01:06:05,015
I felt so lonely at that moment

683
01:06:05,766 --> 01:06:08,602
Nobody down there is who I wanted to see

684
01:06:09,061 --> 01:06:10,646
They're all thousand miles away

685
01:07:11,373 --> 01:07:14,084
It's hopeless, humanity is dead

686
01:07:47,826 --> 01:07:51,413
He's pitiful, his head's all bloody

687
01:07:51,496 --> 01:07:52,873
Let's go home, Lai-fu

688
01:08:40,712 --> 01:08:41,880
Mr Sun

689
01:08:44,341 --> 01:08:46,510
I'm sorry about that night, Mr. Sun

690
01:08:50,597 --> 01:08:53,016
She wants you to have
this two hundred thousand

691
01:08:53,475 --> 01:08:55,101
It's to buy a house with

692
01:09:00,106 --> 01:09:02,400
She misses you very much

693
01:09:02,692 --> 01:09:06,279
She'll visit you when she comes back

694
01:09:14,704 --> 01:09:16,998
There's something I want to tell you

695
01:09:17,457 --> 01:09:21,044
She's lucky, she's got popular fast

696
01:09:21,545 --> 01:09:23,129
A lot of girls dream about...

697
01:09:23,588 --> 01:09:25,841
Being the way she is now

698
01:09:27,008 --> 01:09:28,301
I hope you'll give her your help

699
01:11:10,946 --> 01:11:11,905
Ah-ming

700
01:11:16,910 --> 01:11:18,161
Ah-ming

701
01:11:35,178 --> 01:11:36,805
Ah-ming

702
01:11:38,223 --> 01:11:39,224
Ah-ming

703
01:11:43,979 --> 01:11:46,773
Call an ambulance

704
01:12:22,183 --> 01:12:29,024
Taxi driving is the job he owned

705
01:12:29,274 --> 01:12:39,993
Killed in tearing an illegal building

706
01:12:40,285 --> 01:12:50,462
Totally joining his funeral with our respect

707
01:12:50,837 --> 01:13:02,724
His soul will live with us forever

708
01:13:03,391 --> 01:13:15,278
God bless him

709
01:13:16,237 --> 01:13:18,615
Bow to him with utmost heartiness

710
01:13:19,032 --> 01:13:21,659
First bow

711
01:13:22,994 --> 01:13:25,789
Second bow

712
01:13:26,331 --> 01:13:29,959
Third bow

713
01:13:31,544 --> 01:13:34,506
I own you my thanks

714
01:13:37,509 --> 01:13:39,594
Ceremony concluded

715
01:13:46,851 --> 01:13:55,693
Mouse and I are going back to Tai-tung

716
01:13:59,155 --> 01:14:04,327
We'll come to see you when we have time

717
01:14:12,919 --> 01:14:15,046
Ah-ming

718
01:15:18,735 --> 01:15:20,111
First to my home on Hsinyi Road

719
01:15:20,403 --> 01:15:22,447
No, to Yangmingshan first

720
01:15:22,989 --> 01:15:25,575
Didn't you agree to let me see Dad first

721
01:15:25,867 --> 01:15:30,496
Your concert will begin in two days

722
01:15:30,872 --> 01:15:32,540
Concentrate on your practice

723
01:15:32,957 --> 01:15:36,419
Trust me to take care of your father

724
01:15:38,171 --> 01:15:43,843
This concert is important to us

725
01:16:47,198 --> 01:16:49,951
The best singer of the year Miss Sun Jui-chi

726
01:16:50,243 --> 01:16:52,912
She's returned by taking CAL

727
01:16:52,996 --> 01:16:55,248
Beef noodles and a beer, Mamasan

728
01:16:55,581 --> 01:16:56,582
Right away

729
01:16:57,083 --> 01:17:01,462
She accepted the invitation
from Singapore Television

730
01:17:04,173 --> 01:17:07,135
It was a very successful tour

731
01:17:07,552 --> 01:17:10,013
Now she's come back to Taiwan

732
01:17:11,014 --> 01:17:14,350
The invitation of the Deal-Mute

733
01:17:14,434 --> 01:17:17,854
For a charity concert on Aug 15

734
01:17:18,271 --> 01:17:22,025
Her talent and charitable generosity

735
01:17:22,025 --> 01:17:24,235
Really impress on the Taiwan entertainmet

736
01:17:24,319 --> 01:17:25,737
Do you know Ah-mei?

737
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:12,909
Where did the people here move to?

738
01:18:13,910 --> 01:18:17,080
Don't know, you're looking for somebody?

739
01:18:18,498 --> 01:18:22,210
An old friend I haven't seen for 20 years

740
01:18:22,293 --> 01:18:23,461
I want to see him

741
01:18:25,838 --> 01:18:29,634
But this place has changed so much

742
01:18:32,637 --> 01:18:34,138
Good-bye

743
01:18:41,104 --> 01:18:44,690
Ah-mei, I've been looking
for you all day already

744
01:18:44,732 --> 01:18:45,691
Finally, I guess you came here

745
01:18:45,733 --> 01:18:46,776
What have you to say about this?

746
01:18:49,070 --> 01:18:50,530
I don't when this happened

747
01:18:51,406 --> 01:18:52,698
I want to find my father

748
01:18:52,949 --> 01:18:55,868
I gave him the money, like you said

749
01:18:56,160 --> 01:18:57,286
He can take care of himself

750
01:18:57,745 --> 01:18:59,997
We have to prepare for the concert

751
01:19:00,164 --> 01:19:02,750
You have a press conference too

752
01:19:02,834 --> 01:19:04,210
We've got too many things to do

753
01:19:04,252 --> 01:19:06,295
You can't destroy yourself this way

754
01:19:07,463 --> 01:19:09,173
I'm begging

755
01:19:11,592 --> 01:19:15,179
It's luck Ah-mei left that money

756
01:19:15,513 --> 01:19:20,101
It covered Ah-ming's funeral, the noodle store

757
01:19:20,101 --> 01:19:22,061
We can get by

758
01:19:22,562 --> 01:19:25,064
Uncle thinks of Ah-mei all day

759
01:19:25,398 --> 01:19:27,984
He doesn't say so, but I can tell

760
01:19:28,025 --> 01:19:30,319
So I live with him

761
01:19:32,196 --> 01:19:34,740
His health isn't good lately

762
01:19:35,074 --> 01:19:37,368
I can't take care of him, living there

763
01:19:37,452 --> 01:19:41,122
I'm too old to care what people say

764
01:19:50,131 --> 01:19:52,091
Uncle's blowing again

765
01:19:52,717 --> 01:19:57,305
He used to soothe Ah-mei that way

766
01:19:57,388 --> 01:20:01,434
That would make her laugh, so cute

767
01:20:04,604 --> 01:20:06,481
Since Ah-mei went abroad

768
01:20:06,564 --> 01:20:09,317
Uncle blows all the time

769
01:20:09,734 --> 01:20:10,860
There something

770
01:20:11,277 --> 01:20:14,655
Say hello to uncle for me

771
01:20:32,048 --> 01:20:33,674
Ah-mei's come back

772
01:20:37,845 --> 01:20:43,601
I'll go see her in a couple of days

773
01:20:44,602 --> 01:20:46,896
Want to sell wine bottles?

774
01:21:20,096 --> 01:21:21,180
President

775
01:21:30,273 --> 01:21:33,568
Ah-mei, try the song I wrote for you

776
01:21:34,026 --> 01:21:35,903
I hope

777
01:21:36,320 --> 01:21:38,364
You can sing it for those who need love

778
01:21:38,864 --> 01:21:40,658
Especially for your father

779
01:21:41,117 --> 01:21:42,118
<i>Shin Chun-mai</i>

780
01:21:44,912 --> 01:21:48,040
Want.. to...sell...wine...bottle

781
01:21:48,666 --> 01:21:51,502
Want.. to...sell...wine...bottle

782
01:21:54,255 --> 01:21:57,174
Want.. to...sell...wine...bottle

783
01:22:18,946 --> 01:22:23,576
The same moonlight

784
01:22:24,493 --> 01:22:30,458
Shines on the same Hsintien River

785
01:22:32,501 --> 01:22:37,673
The same winter

786
01:22:38,466 --> 01:22:44,722
Brings the same cold rains

787
01:22:46,557 --> 01:22:50,686
The same dust

788
01:22:52,146 --> 01:22:58,402
Is blown by the same wind

789
01:23:01,322 --> 01:23:04,617
The same smiles

790
01:23:05,576 --> 01:23:09,538
The same tears

791
01:23:09,997 --> 01:23:12,625
The same days

792
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:19,507
The same you and me

793
01:23:21,967 --> 01:23:25,805
The same smiles

794
01:23:26,222 --> 01:23:30,851
The same tears

795
01:23:31,227 --> 01:23:33,729
The same days

796
01:23:33,979 --> 01:23:40,194
The same you and me

797
01:23:55,626 --> 01:24:01,424
When did the frog croaks become memory

798
01:24:02,508 --> 01:24:08,514
When did the land become so crowded

799
01:24:08,973 --> 01:24:15,646
With tall buildings towering all around

800
01:24:15,855 --> 01:24:24,280
And neon signs making the night so harsh

801
01:24:25,823 --> 01:24:31,704
Who can tell me? Who can tell?

802
01:24:32,121 --> 01:24:35,166
Did we change the world

803
01:24:35,249 --> 01:24:38,919
Or did the world change you and me?

804
01:24:39,170 --> 01:24:45,092
Who can tell me? Who can tell?

805
01:24:45,384 --> 01:24:48,512
Did we change the world

806
01:24:48,721 --> 01:24:55,394
Or did the world change you and me?

807
01:24:55,978 --> 01:24:58,814
The same moonlight

808
01:24:59,106 --> 01:25:03,611
Shines on the same Hsintien River

809
01:25:05,029 --> 01:25:08,783
The same winter

810
01:25:09,241 --> 01:25:15,414
Brings the same cold rains

811
01:25:15,748 --> 01:25:18,876
The same dust

812
01:25:19,168 --> 01:25:25,382
Is blown by the same wind

813
01:25:26,008 --> 01:25:29,261
The same smiles

814
01:25:29,553 --> 01:25:32,723
The same tears

815
01:25:33,015 --> 01:25:34,850
The same days

816
01:25:35,142 --> 01:25:40,523
The same you and me

817
01:25:40,815 --> 01:25:44,193
The same smiles

818
01:25:44,527 --> 01:25:47,613
The same tears

819
01:25:47,988 --> 01:25:49,907
The same days

820
01:25:50,115 --> 01:25:56,288
The same you and me

821
01:26:09,468 --> 01:26:11,136
Ah-mei

822
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:13,138
Ah-mei

823
01:26:13,556 --> 01:26:14,557
Ah-mei

824
01:26:15,432 --> 01:26:16,559
Ah-mei

825
01:26:17,601 --> 01:26:20,229
Hurry up, hurry up

826
01:26:21,355 --> 01:26:22,189
What's the matter?

827
01:26:22,231 --> 01:26:23,190
Hurry

828
01:26:33,158 --> 01:26:35,870
I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen

829
01:26:37,037 --> 01:26:42,001
There is something happened
in Sun Jui-chi's family

830
01:26:42,334 --> 01:26:46,964
So now we ask Miss Shen to sing for you

831
01:27:05,649 --> 01:27:06,650
Dad...

832
01:27:07,192 --> 01:27:08,527
Dad...

833
01:27:16,035 --> 01:27:17,286
Dad...

834
01:27:46,273 --> 01:27:47,232
Dad...

835
01:27:48,859 --> 01:27:49,860
Dad...

836
01:27:58,369 --> 01:28:02,414
Do you have wine bottles to sell?

837
01:28:02,998 --> 01:28:07,127
Do you have wine bottles to sell?

838
01:28:07,586 --> 01:28:11,215
Do you have wine bottles to sell?

839
01:28:12,091 --> 01:28:15,928
Do you have wine bottles to sell?

840
01:28:16,470 --> 01:28:20,349
What a familiar sound that is

841
01:28:20,808 --> 01:28:25,062
It's been with me day in and day out

842
01:28:25,479 --> 01:28:29,733
I never need to think about it

843
01:28:30,150 --> 01:28:34,655
It's something I can never forget

844
01:28:35,072 --> 01:28:39,118
Without heaven, where would earth be?

845
01:28:39,576 --> 01:28:43,706
Without earth, where would home be?

846
01:28:44,206 --> 01:28:48,585
Without home, where would you be?

847
01:28:48,877 --> 01:28:52,464
Without you, where would I be?

848
01:28:52,840 --> 01:28:56,969
Without you to raise me

849
01:28:57,386 --> 01:29:01,390
To give me warmth and life

850
01:29:01,849 --> 01:29:05,978
Without you to protect me

851
01:29:06,395 --> 01:29:11,233
What would my fate be?

852
01:29:11,275 --> 01:29:15,779
It was you who raised me

853
01:29:16,113 --> 01:29:20,200
Accompany me from my first word saying

854
01:29:20,576 --> 01:29:24,580
It was you who gave me a home

855
01:29:24,955 --> 01:29:30,836
To share with you, together

856
01:29:45,726 --> 01:29:49,897
You cannot open your mouth and speak

857
01:29:49,897 --> 01:29:53,358
But you know black and white, right and wrong

858
01:29:53,358 --> 01:29:56,820
You cannot express how you feel

859
01:29:57,029 --> 01:30:00,491
You contribute your precious life, though

860
01:30:00,866 --> 01:30:04,745
Your familiar sound, from afar

861
01:30:04,870 --> 01:30:08,457
Reminds me of your loving soul

862
01:30:08,499 --> 01:30:12,086
When will you return to my side

863
01:30:12,127 --> 01:30:15,881
And let us sing together

864
01:30:15,923 --> 01:30:17,716
Do you have wine bottles to sell?

865
01:30:17,966 --> 01:30:20,636
Do you have wine bottles to sell?

866
01:30:21,095 --> 01:30:23,931
Do you have wine bottles to sell?

867
01:30:24,640 --> 01:30:27,392
Do you have wine bottles to sell?

868
01:30:28,018 --> 01:30:31,480
Do you have wine bottles to sell?

869
01:30:31,939 --> 01:30:34,441
Do you have wine bottles to sell?

870
01:30:35,067 --> 01:30:38,153
Do you have wine bottles to sell?

871
01:30:38,737 --> 01:30:41,782
Do you have wine bottles to sell?

872
01:30:42,324 --> 01:30:45,035
What a familiar sound that is

873
01:30:45,577 --> 01:30:48,956
It's been with me day in and day out

874
01:30:49,039 --> 01:30:52,417
I never need to think about it

875
01:30:52,793 --> 01:30:56,296
It's something I can never forget

876
01:30:56,630 --> 01:30:59,800
Without heaven, where would earth be?

877
01:31:00,134 --> 01:31:03,387
Without earth, where would home be?

878
01:31:03,679 --> 01:31:06,849
Without home, where would you be?

879
01:31:07,141 --> 01:31:09,935
Without you, where would I be?

880
01:31:10,435 --> 01:31:13,689
What a familiar sound that is

881
01:31:13,981 --> 01:31:17,484
It's been with me day in and day out

882
01:31:17,609 --> 01:31:20,571
I never need to think about it

883
01:31:20,904 --> 01:31:24,783
It's something I can never forget

884
01:31:25,159 --> 01:31:27,452
Do you have wine bottles to sell?

885
01:31:28,495 --> 01:31:31,165
Do you have wine bottles to sell?

886
01:31:31,874 --> 01:31:34,710
Do you have wine bottles to sell?

887
01:31:35,377 --> 01:31:38,172
Do you have wine bottles to sell?

888
01:31:38,755 --> 01:31:42,968
Do you have wine bottles to sell?

889
01:31:43,218 --> 01:31:45,220
Do you have wine bottles to sell?

890
01:31:45,554 --> 01:31:48,390
Do you have wine bottles to sell?

891
01:31:48,682 --> 01:31:50,225
Do you have wine bottles to sell?

892
01:31:50,559 --> 01:31:52,102
Do you have wine bottles to sell?

893
01:31:52,519 --> 01:31:54,146
Do you have wine bottles to sell?

894
01:31:54,438 --> 01:31:57,566
Do you have wine bottles to sell?

895
01:31:58,192 --> 01:32:00,944
Do you have wine bottles to sell?

896
01:32:02,654 --> 01:32:05,574
Do you have wine bottles to sell?

897
01:32:07,201 --> 01:32:12,039
Do you have wine bottles to sell?
