1
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:49,950
There's a bunch of boy's
camping over there.

2
00:03:52,667 --> 00:03:56,740
What a shame! We chose this haunted beach.

3
00:03:56,750 --> 00:04:00,288
To avoid other people
how come they're here too?

4
00:04:00,292 --> 00:04:02,408
They are approaching, what shall we do?

5
00:04:02,417 --> 00:04:06,205
Don't worry, no one would dare
to take advantage of you.

6
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:08,199
But I'm afraid I can't control myself!

7
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,448
Mad nutcase!

8
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:22,325
They are afrom our neighbouring school.

9
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:24,369
I wonder why they're
here is it because of...

10
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,990
Certainly not because of you!

11
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,615
Right, because of me!

12
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:29,081
Because of you?

13
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:32,871
What so funny? Look at the guy in blue.

14
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:35,499
He beseeched me earnestly
for hours yesterday.

15
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:36,865
But I just answered him briefly.

16
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,115
What did you say?

17
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:39,740
Mainly about you!

18
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:41,706
He tried to gather information about you.

19
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:44,415
So I told him we're camping out here today.

20
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:47,249
So it's because of our lovely Juliet again!

21
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,162
Look, how many wolves and
mad dogs you have attracted.

22
00:04:50,792 --> 00:04:53,499
Pretty girl like me is always
the source of troubles!

23
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,582
I'm terribly sorry...

24
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,990
Mad nutcase!

25
00:05:05,583 --> 00:05:08,074
Hey, your chicken wing is burning!

26
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:11,450
I'm busy, you take it!

27
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:33,909
Dumb jerk, you don't seem to
show any response.

28
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:37,666
Are we going to sleep in such a big place?

29
00:05:37,667 --> 00:05:40,249
Big? Why don't we invite them to join us!

30
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:41,990
Mad nutcase!

31
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,664
Look, the 5 boys are pitching five camps.

32
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:48,123
What are they driving at?

33
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,915
Very simply.

34
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:53,329
They want us to sleep with them.

35
00:05:53,333 --> 00:05:54,869
What shall we so then?

36
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:55,830
One of us will flirt with them.

37
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,698
They'll be out of their minds and
may even sleep here.

38
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:58,914
Gosh, my chicken wing's burning!

39
00:05:58,917 --> 00:06:00,032
Same here!

40
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,787
He's singing loson, country bumpkin!

41
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:29,707
I don't understand why
he sings mandrain song?

42
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:32,240
Maybe he only speaks mandarin!

43
00:06:32,250 --> 00:06:35,413
Wrong, because our Juliet likes
to speak mandarin!

44
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:40,533
Gosh, you think it's going to rain?

45
00:06:40,542 --> 00:06:43,249
The weather forecase says it won't.

46
00:06:43,292 --> 00:06:44,998
It's raining, what now?

47
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,662
Keep calm, lets get into the camp.

48
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:09,115
He's still singing in the rain.

49
00:07:09,542 --> 00:07:12,079
He's a Romeo in real life!

50
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:14,825
Romeo? I think he's a mad nutcase!

51
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:17,745
I hope the wind will
blow away his umbrella.

52
00:07:34,667 --> 00:07:36,532
I can't stand it!

53
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,706
Same here!

54
00:07:50,208 --> 00:07:51,618
What are you doing?

55
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,035
The rope is loosen!

56
00:07:53,042 --> 00:07:55,203
Tighten it up. Follow me!

57
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:58,120
There's a temple in
front, let's go in there.

58
00:07:58,125 --> 00:07:59,831
Okay... I'll be right back!

59
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:14,163
Are you ok?

60
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:17,580
Watch out! Get up are you
sure you're alright?

61
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:30,415
What sort a temple is this? So horrible!

62
00:08:30,417 --> 00:08:31,907
God, I'm wet all through!

63
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:34,374
I wonder if there's a caretaker
to lend me an iron.

64
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:37,242
I don't thnk there'll be
anybody except ghost!

65
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:39,366
Don't frighten us or I'll get mad!

66
00:08:39,667 --> 00:08:40,952
Same here!

67
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:53,530
The radio says today'll be a sunny day.

68
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:56,989
I told you to change the damn old radio.

69
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,662
What has it got to do with the weather?

70
00:08:59,667 --> 00:09:03,205
I'm talking to her
what has it got to do with you?

71
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,741
You think the boys will come in?

72
00:09:07,167 --> 00:09:08,748
Sure... I bet they will!

73
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,082
- Let's go in to take shelter.
- Alright!

74
00:09:16,958 --> 00:09:19,040
You think the boys will
take advantage of us?

75
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,081
How are we going to take advantage of them?

76
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,414
Let's disguise ourselves as ghosts!

77
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:24,908
No way. They will be scared away.

78
00:09:24,917 --> 00:09:26,282
What shall we do then?

79
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:27,872
To tell ghost stories to them!

80
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:31,367
I'm sure they'll hold us tightly
if they're scared.

81
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,865
Good!

82
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,616
I've never been hold by a woman before!

83
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:38,664
Let's find a favourable place.

84
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,075
Excuse me, may we share the table?

85
00:09:45,083 --> 00:09:47,244
Oh no, share the temple!

86
00:09:47,667 --> 00:09:50,409
God ahead. Abunch of hypocrites.

87
00:09:50,417 --> 00:09:52,499
Marvelous...

88
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,197
So boring, can you entertain us?

89
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,789
Sure!

90
00:09:59,042 --> 00:10:01,624
Let me tell you a romantic, loving,

91
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:04,037
touching and sentimential love story.

92
00:10:04,042 --> 00:10:06,328
Great...

93
00:10:07,292 --> 00:10:09,783
Are you trying to scare us away by
telling ghost stories?

94
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:11,908
Right, a ghost story!

95
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:17,453
One dark and windy night,
a flash of lighting

96
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,289
just like now...

97
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:28,246
A bunch of people ran
into a ghost in a temple

98
00:10:29,292 --> 00:10:30,407
all of a sudden...

99
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,865
- It's horrible!
- Are you scared?

100
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:37,620
A rat, a big one!

101
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,740
A real big one!

102
00:10:46,792 --> 00:10:50,580
What a coward! He's even scared of a rat!

103
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:52,369
Let me tell you a more
horrible ghost story.

104
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,285
Great, go ahead!

105
00:10:53,292 --> 00:10:55,999
Listen, ghosts hate people
sitting on their table.

106
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:00,831
None of my business.

107
00:11:04,167 --> 00:11:07,910
I smell something strange,
there must a ghost around.

108
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:13,702
When his spirit isn't settled
it will become an ill wind

109
00:11:14,417 --> 00:11:20,492
you know the proverb,
an ill wind brings chills.

110
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:23,369
My hair's standing up on one end!

111
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,956
My legs are like jelly!

112
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:30,073
My grandma says the ghosts
will find a substitute.

113
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:32,788
How?

114
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:34,248
Depends on one's luck.

115
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:37,788
If you have bad luck,
the ghost will get hold of you.

116
00:11:37,792 --> 00:11:40,329
This is what we called possessed.

117
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:44,121
Your eyes will be blurred.

118
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:48,073
As if the ghost is forcing you
to do what he has done.

119
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,240
Bonnie, what are doing?

120
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,118
I'm demonstrating how a person's possessed.

121
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,286
To these six cowards.

122
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:58,914
Six?

123
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:00,990
1,2, 3,4, 5, 6!

124
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,490
But there were only five of them.

125
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,115
How come there are six now?

126
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,415
Are they altogether six people now?

127
00:12:10,417 --> 00:12:12,703
Right!

128
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:15,905
Yes, five in front, and one at the back.

129
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:17,657
See with you own eyes if you don't believe!

130
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,619
Help!

131
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,867
A coward! Don't try to scare us by
telling ghost stories.

132
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,957
They screamed
while they are watching at our back.

133
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:37,869
- Perhaps...
- Don't frighten me.

134
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:40,707
No ghost. Turn around and see with
your own eyes.

135
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:42,619
Turn around and look!

136
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:43,910
Why me?

137
00:12:43,917 --> 00:12:45,578
Comeon, you have guts!

138
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:46,447
No way...

139
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:48,289
Comeon!

140
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:49,873
Alright, I'll do it.

141
00:12:51,667 --> 00:12:53,498
I told you there's no ghost in this world.

142
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,081
Are you sure?

143
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:58,041
See with your own eyes
if you don't believe.

144
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:07,324
Are you sure?

145
00:13:07,542 --> 00:13:09,203
A bunch of cowards!

146
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:13,030
The ghost won't kill you for just
a little glance.

147
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:16,203
It stops raining, let's go!

148
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,699
Yeah... packing up

149
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:24,994
it's mine

150
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:36,078
Get the stuff. Come on, let's go!

151
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:39,780
Ok... got the lights on here!

152
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:42,664
Wait for me!

153
00:13:42,667 --> 00:13:43,782
Hurry up!

154
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:13,332
Gosh, we're here in this prison again.

155
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:16,075
God, I haven't finished my homework yet.

156
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,039
Work on it now!

157
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,118
Twiggy!

158
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,365
Twiggy!

159
00:14:43,667 --> 00:14:44,873
What's the matter?

160
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,698
I'm in deep trouble!

161
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,120
You haven't finished your homoe work again?

162
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,787
Come on, give me a hand!

163
00:14:51,792 --> 00:14:53,703
Alright I'll finish it for you by tomorrow!

164
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:55,073
You'll take care of the doggie for me.

165
00:14:55,083 --> 00:14:56,698
The warden's going to
check the rooms today.

166
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:58,790
Leave the doggie here and take
it back afterwards.

167
00:14:58,792 --> 00:15:00,453
Thanks a lot!

168
00:15:01,333 --> 00:15:02,413
Mad nutcase!

169
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,116
Hi! Honey!

170
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:17,907
Mad nutcase!

171
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:30,155
Honey... that rope moves...

172
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:36,993
Hang on!

173
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:42,790
I saw it crawling down from the desk.

174
00:15:42,792 --> 00:15:44,077
You must be joking!

175
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,790
I think it's because you
read playboy too much.

176
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,332
Fortunately twiggy has fed you!

177
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:31,165
I'm sorry...

178
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:34,699
Bobby, are you alright?

179
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,206
Are you tired?

180
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,073
I'm exhausted, I want to sleep.

181
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:44,041
Darling, go to bed!

182
00:17:29,583 --> 00:17:31,164
How indecent, I don't want to see it!

183
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,289
Su no evil!

184
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,369
Help!

185
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:58,366
Help!

186
00:17:58,375 --> 00:17:59,740
What's the matter?

187
00:17:59,917 --> 00:18:01,532
Who's attacking you?

188
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,449
I saw a man in manchu costumes.

189
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,915
He just looks like a rampire.

190
00:18:06,917 --> 00:18:08,373
Which part of your body did he attack you?

191
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,615
The bottom of my feet!

192
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,661
Come on, don't try to make a fool of us!

193
00:18:11,667 --> 00:18:13,532
I'm serious, it's true!

194
00:18:13,542 --> 00:18:15,078
Where's he now?

195
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:17,039
He disappeared in the air.

196
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:20,996
Still thinking of
the ghost story in the temple?

197
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,742
You'll have nightmares
if you're over-exhausted!

198
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,206
Go to bed early!

199
00:18:33,667 --> 00:18:35,077
I just don't understand!

200
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:58,244
You... who are you?

201
00:18:58,708 --> 00:19:00,699
I beseech thee not to get panic-stricken.

202
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,869
I'm very sorry to intrude
upon your privacy.

203
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,036
Are you trying to Rob me?

204
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,541
I'm not a burglar, I'm...

205
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,664
I'm not a human being!

206
00:19:11,667 --> 00:19:14,033
I know you're not a human
being you're a beast.

207
00:19:14,042 --> 00:19:17,205
How dare you sneak into
a girl's room at night?

208
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,119
And touch the bottom of my feet.

209
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,740
You're a sex maniac!

210
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,206
I'm not a sex maniac.

211
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,414
I'm a ghost!

212
00:19:23,417 --> 00:19:25,157
You're an extra in the movies.

213
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:28,204
Ridiculous, I don't
believe you are a ghost!

214
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,783
Don't be so sure,
since you haven't seen a ghost before!

215
00:19:31,042 --> 00:19:33,408
How do you know I've never seen a ghost?

216
00:19:33,417 --> 00:19:35,954
Believe me, I'm a real ghost!

217
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,199
I think you're just putting one foot
in the grave!

218
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:40,663
Why are you hitting a kind man?

219
00:19:40,667 --> 00:19:42,908
So you admit you're a man!

220
00:19:42,917 --> 00:19:44,407
I'm a ghost!

221
00:19:44,417 --> 00:19:46,373
Alright, you're a ghost!

222
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:50,414
Since you don't believe,
I'll show you something.

223
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:56,823
Up!

224
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,706
Stop!

225
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,365
Keep your fingers off my clothes!

226
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,615
You're a magician?

227
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:36,539
Wrong you are...

228
00:20:37,167 --> 00:20:38,782
So you're a real ghost?

229
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:39,872
Right you are!

230
00:20:39,875 --> 00:20:47,875
Help... a ghost! Please help me out!
Help... a ghost!

231
00:20:49,667 --> 00:20:53,990
Stop yelling, it's already very late!

232
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,957
You're a ghost, please leave me alone!

233
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,370
I don't want to scare
you, you brought me here.

234
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:00,535
Only a dumb jerk did!

235
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:02,032
So you're a dumb jerk!

236
00:21:02,042 --> 00:21:05,079
I hanged myself with
this rope in the temple.

237
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,825
And this rope becomes
the abode of my spirit.

238
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,788
So you brought here
my spirit together with the rop.

239
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:16,330
Yet I am not trying to harm you.

240
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:19,825
What I did is just to prove my identity.

241
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,996
Pardon me if I have intrude upon your time!

242
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:26,370
Oh my god, I'm scared to death!

243
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,831
The game's over, you may go now!

244
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:32,535
You want to get rid of me?

245
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,619
You're insulting my dignity.

246
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,866
Actually I'm a scholar official
known is bindeye.

247
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:38,240
Binding your eyes?

248
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:41,413
You mean binding your neck?
Don't get confused!

249
00:21:41,417 --> 00:21:42,782
This is neck, not eye.

250
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:43,998
This is eye, not neck!

251
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,116
You died cos you bound
your neck & hang yourself.

252
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,832
You don't seem to know anything about
human structure.

253
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,165
But you know nothing about Chinese history.

254
00:21:51,167 --> 00:21:53,453
Bindeye is the secound place
in the imperial exams.

255
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:56,530
One after the winner, one above the thired.

256
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:59,158
I was a bindeye in the ching dynasty.

257
00:21:59,167 --> 00:22:01,579
My job was in the archives.

258
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:05,872
Stewart pik's my name,
I'm known as scholar pik.

259
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:08,039
I think you're a stupid pig.

260
00:22:08,042 --> 00:22:11,455
So why did you commit suicide?

261
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,244
It's a long story!

262
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,322
I don't want to listen to it.

263
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,369
I'm very tired, what do you want?

264
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:20,617
Please bring the rop back to the temple.

265
00:22:20,625 --> 00:22:24,038
No problem, after our sports day tomorrow!

266
00:22:24,917 --> 00:22:28,489
Thank you from the bottom
of my heart, adieu!

267
00:22:40,208 --> 00:22:42,039
Does it mean I have tough luck?

268
00:22:59,208 --> 00:23:01,745
You look so pale?

269
00:23:02,458 --> 00:23:04,198
I ran into a ghost last night!

270
00:23:09,458 --> 00:23:10,789
Why did you come here?

271
00:23:11,417 --> 00:23:12,873
I just walked in to get changed.

272
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:14,081
Why did you follow me?

273
00:23:14,083 --> 00:23:16,574
Are you kidding? We came here before you.

274
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:21,323
You're a ghost, please leave me alone!

275
00:23:21,333 --> 00:23:22,948
Why are you following me everywhere?

276
00:23:23,417 --> 00:23:26,580
I don't want to be bored to death.

277
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:28,949
I want to see this wonderful world.

278
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:30,893
You're just disgusting, I can't stand you!

279
00:23:30,917 --> 00:23:32,032
Can't stand me?

280
00:23:32,042 --> 00:23:33,248
What does this mean?

281
00:23:34,542 --> 00:23:35,952
Someone's coming, you
want to scare them away?

282
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,368
Get lost immediately!

283
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:40,786
Yes, ma am!

284
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:46,207
Are you Bonnie lam from the red cotton?

285
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:47,873
This is she!

286
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,207
You're the most promising
representative in f.5?

287
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:18,573
I don't deserve it...

288
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:20,623
Of course you don't deserve it
it's just ridiculous!

289
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,991
So you brought the rope to hang yourself?

290
00:24:28,792 --> 00:24:30,202
Shit!

291
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:34,698
Oh~~

292
00:24:35,375 --> 00:24:37,411
you know what will happen
when the race starts!

293
00:24:44,125 --> 00:24:45,365
Are you alright?

294
00:24:45,375 --> 00:24:46,911
She weighs tons!

295
00:24:46,917 --> 00:24:49,954
I... I just can't stand her!

296
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:50,868
Hurry up and get changed.

297
00:24:50,875 --> 00:24:52,285
Alright!

298
00:24:52,292 --> 00:24:53,327
You...

299
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:55,494
It's ok, we're had our close encounter.

300
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,912
Only you will see me and they won't.

301
00:24:57,917 --> 00:25:01,580
First call for all the contestants.

302
00:25:01,583 --> 00:25:03,289
It's almost time!

303
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:04,907
Alright, we're coming!

304
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:08,910
Oh my god.

305
00:25:08,917 --> 00:25:10,248
See no evil!

306
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,241
Come on, warm up yourselves first!

307
00:25:29,875 --> 00:25:35,541
Speed up... red cotton...

308
00:25:35,833 --> 00:25:43,833
Speed up... red cotton...

309
00:25:45,542 --> 00:25:46,748
Speed up?

310
00:25:56,833 --> 00:26:02,078
Blue Rose speeds up the pace
blue Rose wins the race!

311
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:13,364
A big bird! A giant bird...

312
00:26:19,708 --> 00:26:23,246
Oh my god, I'm scared!

313
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,367
The final of discus will
start very shortly.

314
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,082
Bonnie lam represents the red cotton.

315
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:50,450
Tarzan ko represents the blue Rose.

316
00:27:13,375 --> 00:27:21,123
Blue Rose will be the champion!

317
00:27:21,500 --> 00:27:24,207
This is the final of gavelin.

318
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:29,328
Help!

319
00:27:37,625 --> 00:27:45,625
Blue Rose will lead the race!

320
00:27:52,125 --> 00:27:54,707
Last call for 100 metres spring.

321
00:27:56,625 --> 00:27:59,332
The blue Rose is still leading the race.

322
00:27:59,333 --> 00:28:02,200
Speed up, Bonnie!

323
00:28:04,208 --> 00:28:05,789
On your Mark!

324
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:10,240
Set!

325
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:15,498
Over there

326
00:28:27,583 --> 00:28:29,790
I made it...

327
00:28:31,625 --> 00:28:37,040
Blue Rose is still leading and
red cotton the last!

328
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:40,533
We'll be the emperor's eunuch again.

329
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:41,452
What does that mean?

330
00:28:41,458 --> 00:28:42,743
Our prime time has passed!

331
00:28:42,750 --> 00:28:48,746
Blues are tops, reds are flops!

332
00:28:49,083 --> 00:28:53,247
Pole vault, this is Tarzan ko's game!

333
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,327
Fantastic!

334
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:16,575
Bonnie made it! It's a miracle!

335
00:29:17,625 --> 00:29:19,035
Bonnie is terrific!

336
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:24,082
Reds are the best. First in every test!

337
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:33,374
I object, I really did jump over!

338
00:29:33,792 --> 00:29:35,953
I don't believe it, I really jumped over!

339
00:29:39,958 --> 00:29:41,164
Push!

340
00:29:43,292 --> 00:29:45,374
Yeah!

341
00:29:47,917 --> 00:29:51,660
Bonnie won many extra points
for the red cotton!

342
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:54,616
The next game is "long jump"

343
00:30:03,375 --> 00:30:04,740
Less than 1 metre!

344
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:16,706
That's enough...

345
00:30:21,458 --> 00:30:23,164
It's not long enough!

346
00:30:23,458 --> 00:30:28,157
Reds can burst. Always the first!

347
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:31,489
It's a miracle,
Bonnie broke the world's record.

348
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,866
The red cotton is getting near!

349
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:38,073
Always the first!

350
00:30:38,583 --> 00:30:40,164
Shot putt!

351
00:30:40,167 --> 00:30:45,787
Ko specializes inj shot putt
see how far she'll get to!

352
00:30:50,917 --> 00:30:52,123
Only 1 metre!

353
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,206
The lowest record!

354
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,956
Yeah!

355
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:07,288
I don't believe it, its incredible!

356
00:31:10,375 --> 00:31:15,699
Reds are strong, reds jump long!

357
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:18,407
The blue Rose is only a few points ahead.

358
00:31:18,417 --> 00:31:22,035
4-people relay, the red
cotton's last chance!

359
00:31:24,875 --> 00:31:28,697
Chance is not good because of their
height difference.

360
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:30,164
On you Mark!

361
00:31:30,583 --> 00:31:31,868
Set!

362
00:31:37,333 --> 00:31:39,369
Hurry up!

363
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,332
It's game over.

364
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,411
Please give me a hand!

365
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:16,948
The blue Rose is leading the race.

366
00:32:18,917 --> 00:32:20,077
What is she holding?

367
00:32:20,917 --> 00:32:21,997
A bottle?

368
00:32:22,625 --> 00:32:23,831
A hotdog?

369
00:32:31,375 --> 00:32:34,082
This way...

370
00:32:35,458 --> 00:32:38,325
Hurry up!

371
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:01,989
I can't hold her any longer!

372
00:33:12,875 --> 00:33:20,875
Reds are winners. Move over, beginners!

373
00:33:51,917 --> 00:33:56,456
You're just terrific, you're the champion.

374
00:33:58,083 --> 00:33:59,493
A fairy friend helped me out!

375
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:01,582
But he looks a bit weird!

376
00:34:01,583 --> 00:34:04,165
I think there must be
something wrong with ko!

377
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:05,748
I don't force you the believe me!

378
00:34:07,417 --> 00:34:08,577
What are you doing here?

379
00:34:08,583 --> 00:34:09,948
Waiting for you!

380
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:12,119
This is a ladies bathroom, get lost

381
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:13,706
I like the atmosphere here!

382
00:34:13,708 --> 00:34:14,823
Come here!

383
00:34:15,917 --> 00:34:18,078
Sex-maniac,
I'll bind your eyes sooner or later.

384
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:21,329
Mencius said, food and sex is man's nature.

385
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:23,574
This is said by confucius.
What's the matter?

386
00:34:27,167 --> 00:34:28,327
Are you really going?

387
00:34:28,333 --> 00:34:29,448
Sure.

388
00:34:29,750 --> 00:34:32,412
Don't go away, please stay!

389
00:34:32,417 --> 00:34:34,123
I'll be friend with you.

390
00:34:34,125 --> 00:34:34,955
Friend?

391
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:37,791
That means we'll be
intimate and bosom friends!

392
00:34:37,792 --> 00:34:39,532
Intimate and bosom?

393
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:46,744
Impossible.
Human being & ghost can't be friends.

394
00:34:47,333 --> 00:34:48,448
Besides, I'm afraid.

395
00:34:48,458 --> 00:34:49,743
What are you afraid of?

396
00:34:49,750 --> 00:34:53,538
I'm afraid we'll fall in
love with each other.

397
00:34:54,458 --> 00:34:56,744
Don't worry, I won't!

398
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,081
But I'll.

399
00:34:58,083 --> 00:35:00,790
Doesn't matter, I'm a
very conservative girl.

400
00:35:00,792 --> 00:35:03,204
I won't easily make love with you.

401
00:35:03,208 --> 00:35:05,415
Make love? What does that mean?

402
00:35:06,958 --> 00:35:08,698
That mean we'll make friends!

403
00:35:09,292 --> 00:35:11,578
So make love means make friends?

404
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:15,207
How can a ghost make friends with a girl?

405
00:35:15,208 --> 00:35:15,947
A wicked ghost!

406
00:35:15,958 --> 00:35:16,947
A good ghost!

407
00:35:16,958 --> 00:35:20,325
No problem. You're not a ghost to me.

408
00:35:20,333 --> 00:35:21,333
You're a...

409
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,990
A fairy!

410
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:26,162
Ths most intelligent fairy in this world.

411
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,581
Honestly I'm very intelligent.

412
00:35:28,583 --> 00:35:30,824
If not, I wouldn't have become a bindeye.

413
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:32,994
So you should stay and help me out.

414
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,788
You can help me to solve out many problems.

415
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:39,662
My pleasure, helping people is
the source of happiness.

416
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:43,618
Actually I feel very
happy after helping you.

417
00:35:43,625 --> 00:35:47,447
Right, you should stay
and I'll make you happy.

418
00:35:47,458 --> 00:35:49,699
Come in, I'll teach you how to
play electronic games.

419
00:35:50,792 --> 00:35:51,998
Please.

420
00:35:55,125 --> 00:35:56,365
What the hell is she doing?

421
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:05,330
What's the matter?

422
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:06,533
There must be somebody inside.

423
00:36:07,792 --> 00:36:08,531
None.

424
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:10,874
Don't lie to us. Is there a boy inside?

425
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:13,116
Across my heart, there's nobody in my room.

426
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:14,365
He's not a human being.

427
00:36:14,375 --> 00:36:15,490
You mean he's a foreign devil?

428
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:17,411
So you're going out with a foreign devil.

429
00:36:17,417 --> 00:36:18,953
Don't get me wrong!

430
00:36:18,958 --> 00:36:22,246
Introduce him to us in
the school ball tonight.

431
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:23,205
I'll give you 3 minutes.

432
00:36:23,208 --> 00:36:26,621
To bring him to our room and meet us.

433
00:36:26,625 --> 00:36:28,581
If not, we'll disclose
the fact to everybody.

434
00:36:32,875 --> 00:36:34,160
Foreign devil?

435
00:36:35,708 --> 00:36:38,290
Scholar pik, come with
me to meet my 2 friends.

436
00:36:38,292 --> 00:36:41,489
Nonsense, I'm a highly
esteemed ching officer!

437
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,411
They should come to see me instead.

438
00:36:43,417 --> 00:36:45,874
Don't be so aloof, they'll trick you!

439
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,538
Only the ghost can trick man
not the other way round!

440
00:36:49,542 --> 00:36:50,748
Mothing is impssible in this world.

441
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,708
Right, unless you burn my rope.

442
00:36:59,208 --> 00:37:00,994
Alright, I'll meet your 2 friends.

443
00:37:02,667 --> 00:37:03,452
Who is it?

444
00:37:03,458 --> 00:37:04,823
I've brought him here!

445
00:37:04,833 --> 00:37:07,905
I warn you: Don't be scared.

446
00:37:07,917 --> 00:37:09,157
Come in!

447
00:37:16,167 --> 00:37:17,873
Your boyfriend is a gutless coward.

448
00:37:20,292 --> 00:37:22,123
Look, he's sacred away.

449
00:37:22,542 --> 00:37:23,827
Come out!

450
00:37:25,292 --> 00:37:26,782
Come out!

451
00:37:28,208 --> 00:37:29,573
What are you doing?

452
00:37:29,708 --> 00:37:31,744
Come out or I'll burn it!

453
00:37:38,917 --> 00:37:40,498
You have to keep calm.

454
00:37:40,500 --> 00:37:44,288
A 1000 year old antique
will appear at your back.

455
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,536
How are you?

456
00:37:54,292 --> 00:37:55,953
Good day, ma'am!

457
00:37:57,833 --> 00:37:59,824
Oh, it's only a dumb jerk!

458
00:38:01,292 --> 00:38:02,748
Are you a cantonese opera singer?

459
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:04,786
Or a singer in the open-air market.

460
00:38:04,792 --> 00:38:07,158
I'm not a bit-actor! I was nearly
the topscholar in China.

461
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:11,451
Dressing up?
We don't have a costume party tonight.

462
00:38:12,042 --> 00:38:15,239
Did you do anything
indecent in Bonnie's room?

463
00:38:16,167 --> 00:38:18,579
I didn't... I'm a scholar.

464
00:38:18,583 --> 00:38:20,949
I'm well-versed in poems,
and I know the rules.

465
00:38:20,958 --> 00:38:24,155
I'm a highly esteemed and learned bindeye.

466
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:26,579
How dare you condemn me
as a thired rate actor.

467
00:38:26,583 --> 00:38:29,700
I'm angry for you accused me
of imposing as topscholar.

468
00:38:29,792 --> 00:38:30,792
Now...

469
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:33,158
You even accused me of indecent assault.

470
00:38:33,542 --> 00:38:35,874
I'm innocent...

471
00:38:36,708 --> 00:38:38,039
Are you singing catonese operea?

472
00:38:38,042 --> 00:38:40,249
This is not human language.

473
00:38:40,250 --> 00:38:43,617
Please don't talk like a smart ass.

474
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:46,162
Be more straight forward.

475
00:38:46,167 --> 00:38:48,579
Okay, I'll be more straight forward.

476
00:38:48,583 --> 00:38:49,572
If you have no objection.

477
00:38:49,583 --> 00:38:52,040
I'd like to make love with both of you!

478
00:38:53,542 --> 00:38:54,782
You're really very straight forward!

479
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:56,328
I think he's out of his mind.

480
00:38:56,333 --> 00:38:57,823
I have already made love with her.

481
00:38:57,833 --> 00:38:59,118
Why can't I make love with you!

482
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:01,331
So you have made love...

483
00:39:01,875 --> 00:39:03,160
He doesn't understand english.

484
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:05,203
Actually he is a ghost from ching dynasty.

485
00:39:05,208 --> 00:39:07,950
But he's not a harmful ghost.

486
00:39:07,958 --> 00:39:09,289
I don't get it.

487
00:39:09,292 --> 00:39:12,364
Right, a ghost can't be so dumb.

488
00:39:12,875 --> 00:39:14,456
I told you the fact but
you don't believe me.

489
00:39:14,458 --> 00:39:16,414
Show something to them to prove yourself.

490
00:39:16,417 --> 00:39:19,033
Alright, right away!

491
00:39:22,583 --> 00:39:23,698
That's the end of it.

492
00:39:57,583 --> 00:39:59,574
It's very dangerous to
be friends with a ghost.

493
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:02,370
If you're possessed, you're done, right?

494
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:05,538
I don't know. What do you think?

495
00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:09,371
At least there's I advantage-during
the sports day.

496
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:13,038
It's because of his help.

497
00:40:13,042 --> 00:40:15,158
That I won the champion!

498
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:17,532
At least there is some benefits!

499
00:40:17,792 --> 00:40:19,032
Is he coming tonight?

500
00:40:19,042 --> 00:40:20,282
Sure!

501
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:24,999
You'll be able to see him.

502
00:40:28,958 --> 00:40:30,118
Sister.

503
00:40:31,292 --> 00:40:33,658
Here comes your prince charming!

504
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,911
Boys, this way!

505
00:40:46,917 --> 00:40:48,498
Dumb jerk!

506
00:40:50,458 --> 00:40:51,994
The girls are very charming.

507
00:40:59,375 --> 00:41:01,787
This is sashimi, may I dance with you?

508
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:05,618
Sayonara!

509
00:41:05,833 --> 00:41:07,289
Oki

510
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:11,991
brazano trovaski!

511
00:41:12,417 --> 00:41:13,702
Chan!

512
00:41:13,875 --> 00:41:16,036
May I have the pleasure to dance with you?

513
00:41:23,042 --> 00:41:24,873
Oh, how to solve it!

514
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:30,623
You attracted so many boys
you really need his help!

515
00:41:30,792 --> 00:41:32,407
Let me give you a hand!

516
00:41:32,625 --> 00:41:33,364
You give me a hand?

517
00:41:33,375 --> 00:41:34,956
Ask my advice
when you're looking for a boyfriend.

518
00:41:34,958 --> 00:41:37,415
You can't judge a person
by this appearance.

519
00:41:37,417 --> 00:41:40,864
Some people may be a wolf
in sheep's clothing.

520
00:41:40,875 --> 00:41:43,082
You won't be able to distinguish
you're human being.

521
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:44,539
What's your trick then?

522
00:41:44,542 --> 00:41:46,703
I have a secret weapon, behold and
you will not see!

523
00:41:46,708 --> 00:41:50,326
Sit down and look at the boys over there.

524
00:42:00,417 --> 00:42:01,748
Why is it like that?

525
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:05,495
Well, every person gives out some light.

526
00:42:06,250 --> 00:42:09,447
Look at the short-sighted boy
he has a yellow light.

527
00:42:09,458 --> 00:42:12,040
That means he's a sex-maniac.

528
00:42:12,042 --> 00:42:15,079
Keep away from him!

529
00:42:19,042 --> 00:42:21,874
What about the green light?

530
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:24,662
That means his eyes are blurred!

531
00:42:24,667 --> 00:42:26,749
He always makes mistakes.

532
00:42:27,083 --> 00:42:28,664
I'm sorry...

533
00:42:30,625 --> 00:42:32,286
What about the orange light?

534
00:42:34,042 --> 00:42:35,623
Simply because he drinks
too much orange juice.

535
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:37,832
Does the black light mean
he drinks too much ink?

536
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:41,155
Not really, the black light means
he's unlucky, look.

537
00:42:45,833 --> 00:42:47,118
He hasn't got any light?

538
00:42:47,125 --> 00:42:48,581
That means he's colour blind.

539
00:42:51,042 --> 00:42:51,952
What about the rainbow colour lights?

540
00:42:51,958 --> 00:42:53,073
That means he's colourful man.

541
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:53,788
Is it good or not?

542
00:42:53,792 --> 00:42:58,161
Excellent, that means he's diversified
and interesting.

543
00:42:58,167 --> 00:43:01,489
I bet he's the right guy for you!

544
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:08,207
Welcome, the ball will start very shortly.

545
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:10,073
Just feel free to dance...

546
00:43:10,083 --> 00:43:12,495
No, you have to behave yourselves.

547
00:43:12,500 --> 00:43:15,742
Don't turn off the light,
behave yourselves.

548
00:43:29,250 --> 00:43:31,832
Sister, let's go out and leave them alone!

549
00:43:31,833 --> 00:43:34,119
Alone? I'll keep an eye on them.

550
00:43:42,542 --> 00:43:44,032
May I...

551
00:44:50,125 --> 00:44:52,207
What a boring party!

552
00:44:52,458 --> 00:44:53,368
Let's get out of here!

553
00:44:53,375 --> 00:44:55,366
No way, bindeye pik!

554
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:57,991
Bindeye pik!

555
00:44:59,542 --> 00:45:01,407
Here I am!

556
00:45:01,417 --> 00:45:04,124
We're bored to death,
do you have any tricks?

557
00:45:07,208 --> 00:45:08,493
Because of her?

558
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:11,330
Alright!

559
00:45:23,125 --> 00:45:24,240
Yeah!

560
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:43,244
I laught the most.

561
00:45:43,250 --> 00:45:45,115
Happy ghost! Happy ghost!

562
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:46,456
Do you want woe?

563
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,831
"Oh no! Oh no!"

564
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:50,744
"Playing the fool,"

565
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:52,661
"happy ghost! Happy ghost!"

566
00:45:52,667 --> 00:45:55,739
"That's why I'm cool."

567
00:45:55,750 --> 00:45:56,660
"Happy ghost!"

568
00:45:56,667 --> 00:45:59,659
"Time rushes by and disappears."

569
00:46:00,417 --> 00:46:03,284
"What will be left here?"

570
00:46:03,292 --> 00:46:04,202
"Happy ghost!"

571
00:46:04,208 --> 00:46:07,041
"As long as you have no worries,"

572
00:46:07,042 --> 00:46:07,952
"take note."

573
00:46:07,958 --> 00:46:11,530
"You'll always be merry!"

574
00:46:11,542 --> 00:46:13,373
"Happiness is the most,"

575
00:46:13,375 --> 00:46:15,286
"happy ghost!"

576
00:46:15,292 --> 00:46:17,203
"Hihi haha be it so."

577
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:18,948
"S 0 or no go?"

578
00:46:18,958 --> 00:46:20,869
"Let's all dance,"

579
00:46:20,875 --> 00:46:22,786
"happy ghost!"

580
00:46:22,792 --> 00:46:25,955
"So crazy, not by chance,"

581
00:46:25,958 --> 00:46:26,822
"happy ghost!"

582
00:46:26,833 --> 00:46:29,791
"Time rushes by and disappears."

583
00:46:30,583 --> 00:46:33,416
"What will be left here?"

584
00:46:33,417 --> 00:46:34,372
"Happy ghost!"

585
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:37,242
"Just throw your worries out,"

586
00:46:37,250 --> 00:46:38,114
"hear me out."

587
00:46:38,125 --> 00:46:41,947
"Be happy you're about."

588
00:46:41,958 --> 00:46:45,450
"You'll be so lonely if you're sad."

589
00:46:45,708 --> 00:46:48,495
"So much worries, you'll go mad."

590
00:46:49,458 --> 00:46:52,245
"To be happy is not bad."

591
00:46:52,250 --> 00:46:56,414
"Live a great life and be glad."

592
00:47:11,125 --> 00:47:12,080
"Happy ghost!"

593
00:47:12,083 --> 00:47:15,371
"Time rushes by and disappears."

594
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:18,624
"What will be left here?"

595
00:47:18,625 --> 00:47:19,580
"Happy ghost!"

596
00:47:19,583 --> 00:47:22,416
"Just throw your worries out,"

597
00:47:22,417 --> 00:47:23,327
"hear me out."

598
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:27,030
"And be happy you're about."

599
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:30,661
"Do you want woe?"

600
00:47:30,667 --> 00:47:32,407
"Oh no! Oh no!"

601
00:47:32,417 --> 00:47:34,328
"That's why I'm cool."

602
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:36,289
"Happy ghost!"

603
00:47:36,292 --> 00:47:40,081
"Happiness is the most,"

604
00:47:40,083 --> 00:47:41,948
"happy ghost!"

605
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:43,823
"Hihi haha be it so."

606
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:45,789
"S 0 or no go?"

607
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:56,240
Who moved me to the toliet?

608
00:47:59,875 --> 00:48:01,206
Nobody admits?

609
00:48:01,625 --> 00:48:03,786
Ok, boys this side, the girls over there!

610
00:48:13,917 --> 00:48:15,532
This is the end of the ball!

611
00:48:15,542 --> 00:48:16,748
The game's over!

612
00:48:18,250 --> 00:48:20,741
What a shame, we've just warmed up.

613
00:48:28,708 --> 00:48:31,324
You're not going to take
me back to the temple!

614
00:48:31,333 --> 00:48:32,448
We're busy!

615
00:48:34,833 --> 00:48:36,243
Who is this transvestite?

616
00:48:36,417 --> 00:48:40,160
Transvestite? He's boy
George quite a hit now!

617
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:41,247
Hit?

618
00:48:43,917 --> 00:48:47,114
Smells as good as my wife's shortcakes!

619
00:48:47,125 --> 00:48:48,205
So you're married?

620
00:48:48,208 --> 00:48:48,993
What did she look like?

621
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:49,910
Was she good-looking?

622
00:48:49,917 --> 00:48:51,327
Of course, she ws good looking!

623
00:48:51,333 --> 00:48:53,995
She was known as the
queen of the shortcakes.

624
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,285
Did she sell shortcakes?

625
00:48:55,292 --> 00:48:59,114
Right, she sold shortcakes
while I studied hard!

626
00:48:59,125 --> 00:49:02,447
I was even known as the
prince of shortcakes.

627
00:49:02,458 --> 00:49:03,994
So your wife supported the family?

628
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,661
That means you're a bum!

629
00:49:06,458 --> 00:49:08,198
Don't insult my dignity or I'll be angry.

630
00:49:08,667 --> 00:49:11,454
Fame is very important to a man.

631
00:49:11,583 --> 00:49:16,782
People study hard to get a name.

632
00:49:16,792 --> 00:49:20,580
If I were the topscholar
my wife would be the first lady.

633
00:49:20,583 --> 00:49:22,824
Just imagine how glorious it would be.

634
00:49:22,833 --> 00:49:26,496
I think to be lady bindeye is good enough.

635
00:49:26,958 --> 00:49:28,823
It should be good enough.

636
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:41,530
Don't stand in the way, follow me!

637
00:49:42,917 --> 00:49:44,202
Let's go!

638
00:49:44,208 --> 00:49:45,448
Let me take a look.

639
00:49:45,458 --> 00:49:47,244
Nothing spectecular, move on!

640
00:49:47,833 --> 00:49:48,833
Stop pulling me!

641
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:52,285
Why are you here?

642
00:49:52,292 --> 00:49:55,409
Nothing. I just want to
say good night to you.

643
00:49:55,417 --> 00:49:56,577
Ok, go ahead!

644
00:49:57,667 --> 00:49:59,658
- Good night!
- Good night!

645
00:50:04,375 --> 00:50:06,206
May I come up to say good night?

646
00:50:06,208 --> 00:50:09,371
No way, I'll be punished by
the warden if she sees us.

647
00:50:09,375 --> 00:50:10,740
Go away!

648
00:50:10,875 --> 00:50:14,493
So long, I'll come again another night.

649
00:50:14,833 --> 00:50:15,993
Bye.

650
00:50:16,333 --> 00:50:18,449
Bye-bye! See you.

651
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,661
Why don't you climb up
the water pipe smart ass!

652
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:05,073
What are perfect couple!

653
00:51:27,458 --> 00:51:32,532
What a perfect couple!

654
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:56,365
Can you stay a little bit longer?

655
00:51:56,375 --> 00:51:59,208
No way, I got to attend the class today.

656
00:52:03,875 --> 00:52:05,661
Are we going to get married?

657
00:52:05,667 --> 00:52:08,704
We'll talk about it after I graduate. Bye!

658
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:12,913
You're a bird who takes away my heart.

659
00:53:12,917 --> 00:53:15,454
I'm left alone to sigh.

660
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:19,201
Sigh... I love you so much!

661
00:53:19,208 --> 00:53:24,498
Love you with all my heart
love you in the nights.

662
00:53:24,583 --> 00:53:28,906
What is this? Doesn't make any sense!

663
00:53:29,333 --> 00:53:34,248
Love is over... what is love?

664
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:41,076
Love is blind? Thank you bindeye pik.

665
00:53:42,333 --> 00:53:44,790
Bindeye pik? I always thought dr
slump is the hit.

666
00:53:44,792 --> 00:53:46,828
What series is bindeye pik in?

667
00:53:47,792 --> 00:53:49,453
I hate to be mistaken as an actor.

668
00:53:49,958 --> 00:53:51,994
So this is the writing
skill of a f.5 student?

669
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:54,660
Work harder and pay more attention!

670
00:54:31,417 --> 00:54:33,282
Fantastic...

671
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:35,911
Very good shot!

672
00:54:36,167 --> 00:54:37,407
Come over here!

673
00:54:41,792 --> 00:54:43,828
To send you out means you
can go home earlier.

674
00:54:44,083 --> 00:54:46,415
To retain you means I
have to keep you company.

675
00:54:46,417 --> 00:54:48,497
To hit you means I'll be accused
physical punishment.

676
00:54:48,917 --> 00:54:50,157
Ok, stand there!

677
00:54:52,875 --> 00:54:54,866
Well, you hit me with the chalk.

678
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:57,867
I'll do the same thing to you, fair enough!

679
00:54:57,875 --> 00:55:02,744
You'll realize how painful it is!

680
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,161
Bindeye pik, come and help me out!

681
00:55:06,167 --> 00:55:07,327
Yes, ma'am!

682
00:55:38,458 --> 00:55:39,994
Sister, what's the matter?

683
00:55:40,000 --> 00:55:42,207
Sir, she hit me with the chalk!

684
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:43,914
Sister hit me with the chalk!

685
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:45,865
Who is the one that hit first?

686
00:55:45,875 --> 00:55:47,240
Shel

687
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,741
welll...

688
00:55:52,125 --> 00:55:53,410
You're all accomplices.

689
00:55:53,417 --> 00:55:54,623
Get out of here!

690
00:55:58,958 --> 00:56:02,997
Sir, I'd like to check their uniforms.

691
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:11,197
Your hair's too long, you
have to stay behind!

692
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:15,244
Why did you Polish your nails?

693
00:56:15,250 --> 00:56:16,581
Take your hans out!

694
00:56:16,583 --> 00:56:17,823
Stay behind after school!

695
00:56:19,125 --> 00:56:20,615
Why did you put on lipsticks?

696
00:56:20,625 --> 00:56:21,865
Because my lips are too dry...

697
00:56:21,875 --> 00:56:23,706
No excuse. Stay behind.

698
00:56:25,875 --> 00:56:28,617
Your uniform is too short.

699
00:56:28,625 --> 00:56:29,990
Yours too!

700
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:32,332
Your uniforms should be long enough
to cover your knees.

701
00:56:32,333 --> 00:56:35,325
I have to see your parents.

702
00:56:36,125 --> 00:56:37,990
Aren't you ashamed of
wearing such short skirt?

703
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,457
You're students,
you have to respect yourselves.

704
00:56:40,458 --> 00:56:42,619
You shouldn't expose your body.

705
00:56:42,750 --> 00:56:46,538
You're just like Teddy girls!

706
00:56:47,667 --> 00:56:50,534
Your uniforms should be as long as mine.

707
00:56:50,542 --> 00:56:52,373
Take me as an example!

708
00:56:56,542 --> 00:56:57,702
Stop laughing!

709
00:57:07,708 --> 00:57:09,539
That's funny joke, I
guess everybody's happy.

710
00:57:09,542 --> 00:57:12,124
That's why I say bindeye pik is very smart.

711
00:57:12,125 --> 00:57:13,080
Not really!

712
00:57:13,083 --> 00:57:15,790
He is nasty, wants to see her legs.

713
00:57:16,958 --> 00:57:19,495
Why are you hitting me?
You're so ungreateful!

714
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,286
Venus, your phone call.

715
00:57:21,292 --> 00:57:22,532
Thank you, fattie.

716
00:57:22,708 --> 00:57:24,414
You two carry on!

717
00:57:24,708 --> 00:57:27,495
Come back soon, he doesn't
know how to play!

718
00:57:30,708 --> 00:57:32,869
Here are so many excitying games
in the human world.

719
00:57:33,042 --> 00:57:34,373
Is it what you called dog dog ball?

720
00:57:34,375 --> 00:57:35,160
Ping pong ball!

721
00:57:35,167 --> 00:57:36,156
Yes, I knew it already!

722
00:57:36,167 --> 00:57:39,079
I know everything, from
astrology to gergraphy!

723
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:40,535
Ready!

724
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:41,913
No...

725
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:44,659
Not like that. I'll teach you how to play!

726
00:57:46,292 --> 00:57:50,035
Since you are so learned,
please help me in the exam.

727
00:57:50,125 --> 00:57:53,117
Examination? What sort of examination?

728
00:57:53,125 --> 00:57:55,241
It's a school certificate examination.

729
00:57:55,250 --> 00:57:58,993
If we fail in the mock exam,
we'll be disqualified.

730
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,706
You ask me to help you in the exam, how?

731
00:58:00,708 --> 00:58:02,573
You'l help me to cheat!

732
00:58:03,833 --> 00:58:06,040
You'll be my spook.

733
00:58:07,708 --> 00:58:09,289
No way, I hate to do this sort of thing.

734
00:58:09,292 --> 00:58:11,829
If I had cheated,
I would have become the topscholar.

735
00:58:11,833 --> 00:58:13,039
Just help me then!

736
00:58:13,042 --> 00:58:14,077
No!

737
00:58:14,083 --> 00:58:14,947
You sure you won't?

738
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:15,958
No...

739
00:58:20,208 --> 00:58:22,415
Well, if you won't help me.

740
00:58:22,417 --> 00:58:25,909
I'll bring the rope back to the temple.

741
00:58:26,208 --> 00:58:29,780
Don't try to threaten me, I won't play.

742
00:58:30,333 --> 00:58:32,289
A ghost! A ball!

743
00:58:32,292 --> 00:58:34,453
Honey... the ghost is
playing ping pong ball!

744
00:58:34,792 --> 00:58:36,532
Mad nutcase,
I told you not to read playboy again.

745
00:58:36,542 --> 00:58:39,830
Look, Bonnie is playing
ping pong with nobody.

746
00:58:39,833 --> 00:58:41,369
A ghost!

747
00:58:42,708 --> 00:58:46,451
My dad asked me to go home
I won't join you to study.

748
00:58:46,625 --> 00:58:48,035
Why are talking about ghost all the time?

749
00:58:48,042 --> 00:58:49,327
Your eyes must be blurred.

750
00:58:49,333 --> 00:58:51,119
I'll burn all your playboys, let's go!

751
00:58:51,125 --> 00:58:52,911
I did see it.

752
00:58:57,583 --> 00:58:59,869
Do you know why I asked you to come here?

753
00:59:00,417 --> 00:59:02,248
Sister Lee called me this morning.

754
00:59:02,375 --> 00:59:06,163
And compained that you
have been very naughty.

755
00:59:07,375 --> 00:59:08,785
Is it true?

756
00:59:10,208 --> 00:59:12,790
The exam is drawing near,
don't fool around!

757
00:59:12,792 --> 00:59:14,874
You should concentrate on your studies!

758
00:59:15,958 --> 00:59:18,620
I don't want to give you pressure.

759
00:59:18,875 --> 00:59:22,163
I won't blame you
if you don't achieve good results.

760
00:59:22,167 --> 00:59:25,989
Your sister is a lawyer, your elder
brother's a doctor.

761
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,697
Your younger brother is in Cambridge
with scholarship.

762
00:59:29,708 --> 00:59:32,780
Doesn't matter if you can't make it.

763
00:59:32,792 --> 00:59:34,532
Try second a ttempt if you fail this time.

764
00:59:34,833 --> 00:59:37,495
Or just get married.

765
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:39,331
Don't give yourself a hard time.

766
00:59:40,958 --> 00:59:44,121
Don't listen to what your dad says.

767
00:59:44,125 --> 00:59:47,788
He's just talking nonsense
because he's exasperated.

768
00:59:47,792 --> 00:59:50,909
You have to work hard and pass the exam.

769
00:59:50,917 --> 00:59:53,249
Do this for your beloved mother.

770
00:59:55,958 --> 00:59:59,075
Are you sure you'll take
me back to the temple?

771
00:59:59,083 --> 01:00:01,665
Of course, unless you promise to help me.

772
01:00:03,333 --> 01:00:06,200
No way, even ghost has his principle.

773
01:00:06,208 --> 01:00:07,744
I'm a ghost of dignity.

774
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:19,956
Driver, get off!

775
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:27,618
You're so nice for not talking me back!

776
01:00:30,208 --> 01:00:31,789
Let's get back to the hostel and have fun!

777
01:00:31,792 --> 01:00:33,032
Where are you going?

778
01:00:33,500 --> 01:00:34,990
You won't have fun there!

779
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:38,367
The doctor says the
abortion fee costs $5000.

780
01:00:38,375 --> 01:00:40,536
You got only $1000, that's not enough!

781
01:00:40,542 --> 01:00:42,783
This is what I've got.

782
01:00:42,792 --> 01:00:44,703
Besides, it'll be very dangerous.

783
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:46,619
You have to think out some ways.

784
01:00:46,625 --> 01:00:48,411
I'm not the only person who's reponsible.

785
01:00:48,417 --> 01:00:49,998
So you think I should be responsible.

786
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:52,456
You're no longer a little girl!

787
01:00:52,458 --> 01:00:54,323
You should take precaution.

788
01:00:54,458 --> 01:00:55,823
What are you going to do?

789
01:00:56,292 --> 01:00:57,998
Are you fed up with me?

790
01:00:58,167 --> 01:00:59,828
I didn't say so!

791
01:01:00,292 --> 01:01:03,455
Someone saw you dating with Judy.

792
01:01:04,208 --> 01:01:05,744
You're not my wife.

793
01:01:05,958 --> 01:01:07,994
You have no right to intrude
upon my private life.

794
01:01:15,417 --> 01:01:18,159
Stop crying, I'll call you up
when I got the money.

795
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,115
Godamnity, what an ungrateful bastard.

796
01:01:30,125 --> 01:01:31,706
It's your hard luck to have run into me!

797
01:01:31,708 --> 01:01:34,575
It's our hard luck to know you stupid pig!

798
01:01:35,125 --> 01:01:37,036
What has her pregnancy got to do with me?

799
01:01:37,042 --> 01:01:38,248
Of course you have to bear the responsible!

800
01:01:38,250 --> 01:01:39,990
The ungreateful guy was chosen by you.

801
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:43,618
You bet he's interesting
trustworthy and productive.

802
01:01:43,625 --> 01:01:45,911
Juliet is pregnant,
he's really very productive!

803
01:01:47,250 --> 01:01:48,990
Don't worry, Juliet!

804
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:51,286
Don't try to kill your little baby!

805
01:01:51,292 --> 01:01:53,499
I'll bear the resonsibility if Joe doesn't.

806
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,912
What? You want to be the
father of the baby?

807
01:01:55,917 --> 01:01:59,159
No. I'm going to teach Joe a lesson!

808
01:02:02,625 --> 01:02:05,867
Bindeye pik!

809
01:02:08,333 --> 01:02:09,664
Let's take a ride!

810
01:02:09,667 --> 01:02:11,203
Ok

811
01:02:14,083 --> 01:02:15,118
Sit

812
01:02:16,375 --> 01:02:17,239
sit tight!

813
01:02:17,250 --> 01:02:18,365
I'm scared!

814
01:02:18,375 --> 01:02:20,240
Don't be scared, its very safe.

815
01:02:21,708 --> 01:02:25,621
I'll strangle you to death!

816
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,785
Wow, fantastic!

817
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:33,948
Do you feel happy when you are with me?

818
01:03:34,167 --> 01:03:35,452
Well, sometimes!

819
01:03:36,458 --> 01:03:37,743
Do you like my swimming suit?

820
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:40,366
I bought it from Tokyo.

821
01:03:40,708 --> 01:03:43,040
Very nice. It just fits you.

822
01:03:43,042 --> 01:03:44,748
What a bulky and puffy body!

823
01:03:45,042 --> 01:03:46,407
I beg your pardon? Did you say I'm bulky?

824
01:03:46,417 --> 01:03:47,998
No, I didn't.

825
01:03:49,292 --> 01:03:50,702
He said it.

826
01:03:53,583 --> 01:03:55,915
What do you think of me?

827
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:59,416
You're charming, very feminine.

828
01:03:59,417 --> 01:04:01,078
And energetic.

829
01:04:01,583 --> 01:04:02,993
You got beautiful eyes.

830
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,490
Your nose goes well
with the shape of your face.

831
01:04:04,500 --> 01:04:06,161
And a bloody big mouth.

832
01:04:06,500 --> 01:04:07,740
I beg your pardon? Did you say I'm bulky?

833
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:09,331
I didn't say it.

834
01:04:10,333 --> 01:04:11,914
He said it.

835
01:04:14,708 --> 01:04:16,915
Alright, how are you
getting a long with her?

836
01:04:16,917 --> 01:04:18,623
Are you going to break up with Juliet?

837
01:04:18,625 --> 01:04:21,617
She'll comiit sucide if I leave her now.

838
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:25,034
But believe me, you're the only one
I really love.

839
01:04:25,042 --> 01:04:25,872
Oh really?

840
01:04:25,875 --> 01:04:28,412
Yes, I love you with all my heart!

841
01:04:28,417 --> 01:04:30,123
And disappear after making love!

842
01:04:31,125 --> 01:04:32,581
Sir, your cake!

843
01:04:34,750 --> 01:04:36,206
Get lost!

844
01:04:36,208 --> 01:04:38,790
Toast? How many orders?

845
01:04:38,792 --> 01:04:40,532
Don't pretend to be a smart ass.

846
01:04:40,542 --> 01:04:42,498
If you interrupt again while I'm talking.

847
01:04:42,500 --> 01:04:45,788
I'll throw you into the water, mad nutcase!

848
01:04:45,792 --> 01:04:48,078
I don't understand what
you're talking about.

849
01:04:59,458 --> 01:05:00,573
You son of the bitch!

850
01:05:00,583 --> 01:05:02,039
What's the matter?

851
01:05:02,167 --> 01:05:03,156
Why did you kick me into the water?

852
01:05:03,167 --> 01:05:05,874
I didn't. You jumped down yourself.

853
01:05:06,250 --> 01:05:07,831
You know I'm Peter from the ntk gang!

854
01:05:07,833 --> 01:05:09,243
I'm sorry I don't know!

855
01:05:09,625 --> 01:05:13,698
I'll get some help, don't go away
if you have guts!

856
01:05:15,875 --> 01:05:17,536
You're really a mad nutcase!

857
01:05:21,625 --> 01:05:23,161
Why are splashing water over me?

858
01:05:23,958 --> 01:05:25,619
Why is my hand out of control?

859
01:05:27,917 --> 01:05:29,597
Why are you splashing water over me again?

860
01:05:30,083 --> 01:05:33,155
It's not my fault. Someone held my hand.

861
01:05:33,417 --> 01:05:34,623
Are you alright?

862
01:05:34,875 --> 01:05:36,035
I'm sorry

863
01:05:38,333 --> 01:05:39,448
what are you doing?

864
01:05:39,458 --> 01:05:41,494
Judy.

865
01:05:41,750 --> 01:05:43,115
What are you doing?

866
01:05:45,542 --> 01:05:46,873
You're a wolf in sheep's clothing!

867
01:05:46,875 --> 01:05:48,957
It's not my fault, my hand...

868
01:05:50,250 --> 01:05:52,241
Again.

869
01:05:52,250 --> 01:05:55,083
Excuse me, miss...

870
01:05:55,792 --> 01:05:57,032
You son of the bitch!

871
01:05:57,417 --> 01:05:58,657
Disgusting!

872
01:05:59,833 --> 01:06:01,869
Judy.

873
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:05,706
I can't move my feet!

874
01:06:08,667 --> 01:06:09,907
Joe chan!

875
01:06:11,250 --> 01:06:12,490
Are you frightened!

876
01:06:12,500 --> 01:06:15,287
I'm a ghost, a happy ghsot!

877
01:06:15,292 --> 01:06:19,240
An upright and fair happy ghost!

878
01:06:19,292 --> 01:06:21,749
You won't be able to break up with Juliet!

879
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:23,706
You're doomed!

880
01:06:23,708 --> 01:06:25,073
You've touched different girls.

881
01:06:25,083 --> 01:06:27,950
Now it's time for you
touch the boiling water.

882
01:06:28,083 --> 01:06:29,823
Help!

883
01:06:30,625 --> 01:06:32,911
Help!

884
01:06:36,083 --> 01:06:37,573
What is he doing?

885
01:06:37,583 --> 01:06:40,620
You hypocrite, get married with Juliet.

886
01:06:40,625 --> 01:06:42,286
Bring up you child and educate him.

887
01:06:42,292 --> 01:06:43,998
Be a good husband.

888
01:06:48,708 --> 01:06:49,914
I beg you pardon?

889
01:06:54,458 --> 01:06:57,575
Please let loose my feet and let me go!

890
01:06:57,583 --> 01:06:58,823
Let you go?

891
01:07:00,708 --> 01:07:03,074
Unless you kneel donw and
kowtow to me 3 times.

892
01:07:03,083 --> 01:07:06,371
Say sorry and call me father
then I'll let you go!

893
01:07:06,375 --> 01:07:09,913
Impssible, people will laugh at me.

894
01:07:09,917 --> 01:07:12,533
Doesn't matter. I'll disappear
if you don't do this!

895
01:07:12,542 --> 01:07:14,502
You'll be standing here for
the rest of your life.

896
01:07:14,833 --> 01:07:15,743
Please let me go!

897
01:07:15,750 --> 01:07:17,411
Alright, I'll do what you say!

898
01:07:17,750 --> 01:07:20,583
That's the son of the bitch. Beat him up!

899
01:07:21,167 --> 01:07:24,614
Father I'm very sorry.

900
01:07:25,792 --> 01:07:29,705
He calls you father. Forgive him! Let's go!

901
01:07:29,708 --> 01:07:32,871
Father, I'm very sorry!

902
01:07:34,708 --> 01:07:38,121
Father, I'm very sorry!

903
01:07:41,167 --> 01:07:43,158
Clever boy!

904
01:07:43,375 --> 01:07:45,161
Terrific, someone calls me father!

905
01:08:00,375 --> 01:08:02,081
Boy George!

906
01:08:15,333 --> 01:08:17,198
Do I look great?

907
01:08:32,125 --> 01:08:34,741
Don't turn around, get yourself prepared.

908
01:08:34,750 --> 01:08:36,240
Don't be scared by me!

909
01:08:38,667 --> 01:08:40,032
You look fantastic!

910
01:08:40,042 --> 01:08:41,373
Why didn't you cry?

911
01:08:41,458 --> 01:08:42,197
Cry?

912
01:08:42,208 --> 01:08:43,968
Why did Juliet & Venus
cry when they saw me?

913
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:49,573
Juliet's heart broken, Venus is
worried about the exam!

914
01:08:51,250 --> 01:08:53,787
You just look great!
Where did you get this?

915
01:08:53,792 --> 01:08:55,657
From lene... lene Crawford!

916
01:08:55,667 --> 01:08:58,864
I feel so great after
teaching Joe a lesson.

917
01:08:58,875 --> 01:09:03,574
I want to change my image,
so I went shopping!

918
01:09:03,583 --> 01:09:06,700
Doesn't work, you're still the happy ghost!

919
01:09:06,708 --> 01:09:09,370
Don't laugh at me!

920
01:09:09,375 --> 01:09:12,538
I've helped you to win the champion!

921
01:09:13,583 --> 01:09:16,040
Well, if you're a friend in need.

922
01:09:16,042 --> 01:09:18,909
Help me to cheat in the
Chinese history exam!

923
01:09:20,292 --> 01:09:24,035
I'm not your doggie that
cures your stomache.

924
01:09:25,042 --> 01:09:28,830
You're afraid you don't know the answer!

925
01:09:28,833 --> 01:09:32,951
Nonsense, I'm well-versed in all subjects!

926
01:09:33,750 --> 01:09:37,413
I'll burn your rope, you'll have
nowhere to turn to.

927
01:09:37,417 --> 01:09:39,783
Let me think about it frist!

928
01:09:45,458 --> 01:09:47,369
- Good morning!
- Good morning.

929
01:09:47,375 --> 01:09:49,582
You look so pale, are you alright?

930
01:09:49,583 --> 01:09:52,450
I studied overnight, and
didn't sleep at all.

931
01:09:52,458 --> 01:09:55,040
You must be well prepared. I'm done!

932
01:09:55,042 --> 01:09:56,907
I haven't finished
studying all the subjects.

933
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:17,865
Stop!

934
01:10:18,750 --> 01:10:20,430
Why did you tie the rope round your waist?

935
01:10:20,792 --> 01:10:22,828
I'm... I'm on diet!

936
01:10:22,833 --> 01:10:24,573
The doctor advises me to tie
a rope round my waist.

937
01:10:24,583 --> 01:10:26,824
So that I can abstain from eating too much.

938
01:10:27,167 --> 01:10:29,579
You're always full or tricks, sit down.

939
01:10:30,542 --> 01:10:31,827
Yes sir!

940
01:10:31,833 --> 01:10:32,993
Miss!

941
01:10:34,125 --> 01:10:36,366
Please check your papers.

942
01:10:36,375 --> 01:10:39,082
There should be 3 question sheets
& 5 answer sheets.

943
01:10:39,625 --> 01:10:41,866
Raise up your hands if
you don't have enough.

944
01:10:45,125 --> 01:10:46,456
You may proceed!

945
01:10:50,667 --> 01:10:52,828
Bindeye pik,
see if you can answer the questions!

946
01:10:52,833 --> 01:10:53,868
Let me see!

947
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:55,991
What sort of examination is this?

948
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,520
I just don't understand the questions.

949
01:10:57,625 --> 01:10:59,957
I chose to answer the questions
on ching dynasty.

950
01:10:59,958 --> 01:11:01,994
You were born in that are, how come
you don't understand?

951
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:05,663
We were examinated on the classics.

952
01:11:05,667 --> 01:11:06,782
Let me take a look again!

953
01:11:08,042 --> 01:11:09,748
Analyse the casue of the
fall of ching dynasty.

954
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:11,661
Comment on the high-pressure ching policy!

955
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:13,999
I can't answer these questions or
I'll be executed!

956
01:11:14,000 --> 01:11:16,036
I can't answer them...

957
01:11:16,542 --> 01:11:19,158
You're not going to
answer the questions, right?

958
01:11:23,792 --> 01:11:24,872
What are you doing?

959
01:11:29,458 --> 01:11:31,824
Take a look at others paper and
tell me the answer.

960
01:11:31,958 --> 01:11:33,289
See you!

961
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:54,365
Concentrate on your work!

962
01:12:22,542 --> 01:12:24,328
I'll find out who did this sooner or later.

963
01:12:30,250 --> 01:12:33,572
My memory is completely blank, why?

964
01:12:33,958 --> 01:12:38,497
I studied overnight,
but nothing comes to my mind?

965
01:12:39,667 --> 01:12:41,749
Gosh, I'm running out of time!

966
01:12:42,042 --> 01:12:45,205
I'll just have a quick glance...

967
01:12:47,333 --> 01:12:50,075
Don't do that! If everybody
cheats in the exam.

968
01:12:50,083 --> 01:12:52,995
It'll be unfair to honest
people like myself.

969
01:12:53,000 --> 01:12:54,080
No way!

970
01:12:54,458 --> 01:12:55,573
Give the book back to me.

971
01:13:02,708 --> 01:13:04,073
What are you doing?

972
01:13:13,375 --> 01:13:14,990
Venus, get out of here!

973
01:13:31,625 --> 01:13:34,617
Everybody stops writing!

974
01:13:34,625 --> 01:13:38,994
Remain on your seat
until you're asked to leave.

975
01:13:41,542 --> 01:13:42,782
What now?

976
01:13:43,958 --> 01:13:45,914
You may leave now!

977
01:13:48,042 --> 01:13:49,703
Bonnie, what are you doing?

978
01:13:49,708 --> 01:13:52,040
You claimed to be a learned bindeye.

979
01:13:52,042 --> 01:13:54,499
And a highly esteemed
scholar official, bullshit!

980
01:13:54,500 --> 01:13:55,455
I'm

981
01:13:55,458 --> 01:13:56,914
you're not a friend in need!

982
01:13:56,917 --> 01:13:57,656
What are you doing?

983
01:13:57,667 --> 01:13:58,782
None of my business!

984
01:13:58,792 --> 01:14:00,498
You don't even know how to answer
such simple questions.

985
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:01,615
And you too!

986
01:14:01,625 --> 01:14:03,035
I won't need your help
if I know the answer!

987
01:14:03,042 --> 01:14:04,657
I wonder how you become a bindeye.

988
01:14:04,667 --> 01:14:06,032
You're insulting the
diginity of your friend.

989
01:14:06,042 --> 01:14:09,330
Friend...
What good do I get to be friend with you?

990
01:14:09,333 --> 01:14:12,370
I teach you english, and how to enjoy life.

991
01:14:12,375 --> 01:14:13,831
You are very ungrateful.

992
01:14:13,833 --> 01:14:15,539
I don't want to see you again!

993
01:14:15,542 --> 01:14:16,998
Bonnie!

994
01:14:17,458 --> 01:14:18,789
She's out of her mind
from studying too much.

995
01:14:18,792 --> 01:14:20,157
Poor Venus!

996
01:14:44,458 --> 01:14:45,618
Venus!

997
01:14:52,042 --> 01:14:53,248
Venus was crying
as she was heading for the hostel!

998
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:54,035
Don't bother me!

999
01:14:54,042 --> 01:14:55,703
Venus may do something silly!

1000
01:15:14,292 --> 01:15:17,125
Venus, get down!

1001
01:15:18,542 --> 01:15:22,535
It's very dangerous up there.

1002
01:15:25,750 --> 01:15:27,286
Come down!

1003
01:15:28,917 --> 01:15:31,704
Honey!

1004
01:15:33,125 --> 01:15:37,323
Venus, don't be silly, come over here!

1005
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:45,868
Life is so miserable, I don't want to live.

1006
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:50,539
All my sorrows will be gone if I die.

1007
01:15:50,542 --> 01:15:52,328
Don't come near me!

1008
01:15:55,958 --> 01:15:56,913
What shall we do?

1009
01:15:56,917 --> 01:15:58,453
God knows?

1010
01:15:58,458 --> 01:16:01,780
God? Bindeye pik, please come out!

1011
01:16:01,792 --> 01:16:04,204
Bindeye pik, come out!

1012
01:16:04,208 --> 01:16:08,076
Don't be so narrow-minded
I didn't mean to scold you!

1013
01:16:13,000 --> 01:16:15,366
Venus, please come down!

1014
01:16:15,542 --> 01:16:17,749
I'll inform sister Lee
if you won't come down.

1015
01:16:17,875 --> 01:16:19,240
Right, go and tell sister Lee!

1016
01:16:19,250 --> 01:16:21,332
Doesn't matter, go ahead!

1017
01:16:23,833 --> 01:16:26,905
Help!

1018
01:16:26,917 --> 01:16:28,248
Juliet, don't frighten me!

1019
01:16:31,417 --> 01:16:33,908
I don't want to die yet, Bonnie!

1020
01:16:33,917 --> 01:16:35,703
Hang on a second, I'm coming!

1021
01:16:36,750 --> 01:16:37,750
To resuce her!

1022
01:16:41,833 --> 01:16:45,075
Bindeye pik, don't let Venus die!

1023
01:17:03,708 --> 01:17:05,915
Venus, I don't mean to harm you!

1024
01:17:33,042 --> 01:17:36,205
A ghost! Balloons, balloons again!

1025
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:46,039
Fly away... the little space shuttle...

1026
01:17:46,042 --> 01:17:48,374
Bindeye pik, where's Venus now?

1027
01:17:48,375 --> 01:17:50,331
Don't worry. Just follow me!

1028
01:17:52,500 --> 01:17:56,163
Balloons... last time is ping pong ball
now balloons!

1029
01:17:56,333 --> 01:17:57,789
What balloon?

1030
01:17:57,792 --> 01:18:01,034
A flying bird, oh Venus!

1031
01:18:01,083 --> 01:18:02,573
Venus has turned into a flying bird!

1032
01:18:02,583 --> 01:18:04,073
What are you talking about?

1033
01:18:04,083 --> 01:18:05,539
A ghost!

1034
01:18:05,542 --> 01:18:08,079
I'm sure this hostel is haunted.

1035
01:18:08,083 --> 01:18:09,323
I've withness with my own eyes.

1036
01:18:09,333 --> 01:18:11,449
The girls are mingling with a ghost.

1037
01:18:24,333 --> 01:18:27,166
Bonnie, you're not a friend indeed.

1038
01:18:27,167 --> 01:18:29,287
Why didn't you tell me you're going
to commit suicide?

1039
01:18:29,708 --> 01:18:31,164
Will death solve any problem?

1040
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:32,532
Who taught you this?

1041
01:18:33,708 --> 01:18:36,541
Life is so miserable.

1042
01:18:36,667 --> 01:18:39,659
Maybe I'll be relieved after death!

1043
01:18:39,667 --> 01:18:40,998
I don't think so!

1044
01:18:41,792 --> 01:18:44,534
How do you know since you
have not died before?

1045
01:18:45,125 --> 01:18:46,581
But I have.

1046
01:18:47,625 --> 01:18:52,039
I apologize for plunging you into
such deep trouble.

1047
01:18:52,792 --> 01:18:55,864
I don't blame you, it's my fault!

1048
01:18:55,875 --> 01:18:57,991
I'm sure
you don't want to disappoint your parents.

1049
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,207
Actually, I'm trying my
best to please them.

1050
01:19:00,208 --> 01:19:02,540
However my memory is getting worse.

1051
01:19:02,542 --> 01:19:06,080
It became completely blank.

1052
01:19:06,083 --> 01:19:08,916
I couldn't help but to check!

1053
01:19:09,542 --> 01:19:10,873
It's all your fault!

1054
01:19:16,583 --> 01:19:18,198
I'm ashamed of what I have done!

1055
01:19:18,208 --> 01:19:22,326
If I died, I don't have to
force myself to study.

1056
01:19:25,417 --> 01:19:26,998
Actually I've thought of
committing suicide too.

1057
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,082
I felt so frustrated
when Joseph rejected me.

1058
01:19:29,083 --> 01:19:31,574
And I don't know what to do with my baby.

1059
01:19:34,625 --> 01:19:36,456
Stop crying!

1060
01:19:41,375 --> 01:19:43,832
Bindeye pik, are you crying too?

1061
01:19:44,583 --> 01:19:46,744
Actually I'm not a bindeye!

1062
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:48,615
Alright... you're the topscholar them...

1063
01:19:51,083 --> 01:19:53,165
Okay, you're an emperor!

1064
01:19:53,583 --> 01:19:55,244
I'm not a bindeye.

1065
01:19:55,792 --> 01:19:57,874
I have never been a bindeye.

1066
01:20:00,542 --> 01:20:02,407
This hat was stolen from a bindeye.

1067
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:07,242
I have never been a scholar official
except in dreams.

1068
01:20:07,750 --> 01:20:10,412
I became a scholar at 16,
and after that year.

1069
01:20:11,083 --> 01:20:13,369
I failed in the open exam, for 14 times.

1070
01:20:13,958 --> 01:20:16,290
I sat for the exam at the age
of 17 until I was 37.

1071
01:20:16,292 --> 01:20:17,907
So you're even worse than myself.

1072
01:20:20,833 --> 01:20:24,325
My father had high hopes on me!

1073
01:20:24,833 --> 01:20:27,495
My wife prayed everyday that
I would pass the exam.

1074
01:20:27,667 --> 01:20:31,330
So that she would be the lady topscholar.

1075
01:20:31,542 --> 01:20:34,955
And she wouldn't have to sell shortakes.

1076
01:20:35,375 --> 01:20:36,615
What happned finally?

1077
01:20:37,583 --> 01:20:38,789
Finally...

1078
01:20:45,333 --> 01:20:48,700
Every scholar aims at getting a name.

1079
01:20:49,083 --> 01:20:51,039
But I failed every time.

1080
01:20:51,667 --> 01:20:54,955
My father when I failed
for the seventh time.

1081
01:20:55,583 --> 01:20:57,414
At his death bed, he asked me.

1082
01:20:57,417 --> 01:21:00,489
To keep working hard to attain
the position of topscholar.

1083
01:21:06,167 --> 01:21:10,160
When I failed for the tenth time
even my wife cursed me.

1084
01:21:10,583 --> 01:21:13,700
That I would have to feed on
her shortcakes forever.

1085
01:21:18,667 --> 01:21:22,580
At the 14th time, I though I would make it.

1086
01:21:24,375 --> 01:21:26,206
Unfortunately, I failed!

1087
01:21:30,917 --> 01:21:35,490
Finaly my wife stoped with somebody.

1088
01:21:35,542 --> 01:21:38,955
I was a cuckold husband.

1089
01:21:41,750 --> 01:21:43,991
So I brought along a piece of rope.

1090
01:21:44,250 --> 01:21:47,697
To hang myself in the temple.

1091
01:21:49,708 --> 01:21:51,790
I thought I would be released after death.

1092
01:21:52,458 --> 01:21:56,121
Because I had grievances, my spirit.

1093
01:21:56,375 --> 01:22:00,072
To become reincarnated
I ended up a roving spirit.

1094
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:01,914
Such a lonely and sad existence.

1095
01:22:03,500 --> 01:22:06,458
You hear that! Lucky
both of you didn't die!

1096
01:22:07,333 --> 01:22:09,949
Venus, I think we're both very silly.

1097
01:22:09,958 --> 01:22:12,040
We have been the slave of examinations.

1098
01:22:12,750 --> 01:22:15,332
Right, I'm not silly, I have brains.

1099
01:22:15,333 --> 01:22:18,405
You wasted a lot of time
you've no ambition in life.

1100
01:22:19,042 --> 01:22:20,953
Actually you have your parents
who care for you.

1101
01:22:21,542 --> 01:22:23,373
You've the chance to
receive good education.

1102
01:22:23,583 --> 01:22:27,201
And you got good friends
you should be contented.

1103
01:22:27,542 --> 01:22:28,827
Do you agree?

1104
01:22:33,917 --> 01:22:35,077
Bindeye pik!

1105
01:22:35,083 --> 01:22:35,913
Don't call me bindeye pik!

1106
01:22:35,917 --> 01:22:36,997
Just call me scholar pik.

1107
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:39,116
We're going to sit for
the exam again tomorrow!

1108
01:22:39,125 --> 01:22:41,457
So you have to work harder
and try your very best.

1109
01:22:41,458 --> 01:22:43,824
Even if you fail, you won't feel sorry.

1110
01:22:43,833 --> 01:22:46,870
Ok, you'll make coffee for us.

1111
01:22:46,875 --> 01:22:48,957
You'll mend our socks and clean our rooms.

1112
01:22:48,958 --> 01:22:50,073
Is this an order?

1113
01:22:50,083 --> 01:22:51,744
Alright?

1114
01:22:51,750 --> 01:22:52,705
Alright!

1115
01:22:52,708 --> 01:22:53,914
Good boy!

1116
01:23:05,875 --> 01:23:07,115
Who?

1117
01:23:07,542 --> 01:23:08,907
Give me your school bag.

1118
01:23:08,917 --> 01:23:11,408
No, I've got some
confidential documents inside.

1119
01:23:13,292 --> 01:23:15,123
I'm doing this for your own good.

1120
01:23:17,208 --> 01:23:18,744
This rope helps me to abstain
from eating too much.

1121
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:20,490
Right, there's something strange
about this rope.

1122
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:22,411
No wonder you brought it to the exam hall!

1123
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,661
Apart from keeping a doggie
you want to keep a ghost now!

1124
01:23:26,667 --> 01:23:27,907
Burn it!

1125
01:23:32,958 --> 01:23:34,448
Please don't...

1126
01:23:34,458 --> 01:23:35,538
Get lost!

1127
01:23:38,917 --> 01:23:40,248
All of you!

1128
01:23:41,792 --> 01:23:42,531
Watch the door.

1129
01:23:42,542 --> 01:23:46,282
Scholar pik.

1130
01:23:46,542 --> 01:23:49,329
Get out of here! Go and jog for 1 hour!

1131
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:15,090
No wonder I slept in the
toilet the other day.

1132
01:24:15,458 --> 01:24:17,164
My shirt was pulled up for no reason.

1133
01:24:17,167 --> 01:24:18,748
Now I know the tricks.

1134
01:24:18,833 --> 01:24:21,245
He's our good friend, he won't harm us.

1135
01:24:26,625 --> 01:24:28,286
Sister, please don't burn him.

1136
01:24:29,625 --> 01:24:30,785
No way!

1137
01:24:34,958 --> 01:24:36,518
Why don't you go out and start jogging!

1138
01:24:37,792 --> 01:24:39,453
Or you'll be kicked out from the school.

1139
01:24:41,083 --> 01:24:42,948
Keep running unless I ask you to stop! Go!

1140
01:25:32,375 --> 01:25:34,036
Keep running!

1141
01:26:03,000 --> 01:26:04,115
Get up!

1142
01:26:04,458 --> 01:26:06,949
Keep running, or I'll fail you in the exam.

1143
01:26:17,000 --> 01:26:18,331
I'm very worried about him.

1144
01:26:29,375 --> 01:26:31,491
We can't be so ungrateful,
we have to rescue him.

1145
01:26:54,792 --> 01:26:56,407
It was destroyed!

1146
01:26:59,042 --> 01:27:01,328
You should concentrate on your
studies from now on.

1147
01:27:07,375 --> 01:27:08,490
Scholar pik.

1148
01:27:09,583 --> 01:27:12,414
Scholar pik.

1149
01:27:16,667 --> 01:27:17,827
Scholar pik.

1150
01:27:18,917 --> 01:27:20,407
Scholar pik.

1151
01:27:21,583 --> 01:27:22,914
Where are you?

1152
01:27:23,792 --> 01:27:26,454
Scholar pik.

1153
01:27:40,167 --> 01:27:43,910
Please come out!

1154
01:27:45,083 --> 01:27:47,074
You're a good friend to us!

1155
01:27:48,583 --> 01:27:50,949
You promise to make coffee for us.

1156
01:27:52,500 --> 01:27:53,831
And you promise...

1157
01:27:53,833 --> 01:27:56,245
Scholar pik, it's all our fault!

1158
01:27:57,292 --> 01:27:58,623
Bonnie!

1159
01:28:15,292 --> 01:28:19,490
Scholar pik, our good friend forever!

1160
01:28:20,375 --> 01:28:22,286
Let's go and burn him!

1161
01:28:38,000 --> 01:28:39,456
Scholar pik.

1162
01:29:04,667 --> 01:29:07,249
God, we thought you were dead.

1163
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:09,286
Why didn't you show up earlier, damn it!

1164
01:29:09,417 --> 01:29:11,954
Man will die, but not the ghost!

1165
01:29:11,958 --> 01:29:13,838
You told me you'll die
if the rope is destroyed.

1166
01:29:15,000 --> 01:29:16,911
Now I know you're deeply affected to me.

1167
01:29:16,917 --> 01:29:18,077
I'm not!

1168
01:29:19,250 --> 01:29:20,786
But we did hear you screaming for help.

1169
01:29:20,792 --> 01:29:22,077
Are you sure you're alright?

1170
01:29:22,083 --> 01:29:23,948
At first I thought I'm done.

1171
01:29:24,083 --> 01:29:25,823
When they were burning the rope.

1172
01:29:25,833 --> 01:29:29,746
I was so scared that my spirit flew away.

1173
01:29:29,750 --> 01:29:30,865
You're really ok?

1174
01:29:35,083 --> 01:29:36,869
From the time I be friends
with three of you.

1175
01:29:36,875 --> 01:29:39,241
All my woes is gone forever!

1176
01:29:39,250 --> 01:29:42,037
I'm no longer so narrow minded,
I realized something!

1177
01:29:42,042 --> 01:29:43,407
What have you realized?

1178
01:29:43,417 --> 01:29:45,078
It's more exciting to be a human being.

1179
01:29:45,083 --> 01:29:47,244
Because they have ups & downs.

1180
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:49,957
They have ambitions to crave for.

1181
01:29:49,958 --> 01:29:52,745
So I made up my mind to
reincarnate as a man.

1182
01:29:52,750 --> 01:29:54,741
Great, I'll give you my spiritual support.

1183
01:29:54,875 --> 01:29:56,365
Not only that.

1184
01:29:56,375 --> 01:29:58,741
I need your physical support.

1185
01:30:03,750 --> 01:30:07,322
Now the rope's burnt,
my spirit's attached to a bamboo.

1186
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:09,706
You have to take this bamboo out.

1187
01:30:09,958 --> 01:30:13,621
So that I'll have a chance to reincarnate.

1188
01:30:18,167 --> 01:30:19,907
Where are you carrying the bamboo to?

1189
01:30:20,208 --> 01:30:23,371
We just want to hang the wet clothes.

1190
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,366
You must be joking, there's no sunlight!

1191
01:30:28,667 --> 01:30:32,034
You must be talking nonsense
because of the ghost.

1192
01:30:33,375 --> 01:30:34,956
Are you alright?

1193
01:30:35,208 --> 01:30:36,869
I have a meeting with the headmaster.

1194
01:30:36,875 --> 01:30:39,036
We decided to give you another chance.

1195
01:30:39,167 --> 01:30:41,783
We'll give you private tuition for 2 weeks.

1196
01:30:42,125 --> 01:30:43,740
Ok, go ahead with hanging your clothes!

1197
01:30:45,583 --> 01:30:47,323
Watch out!

1198
01:30:49,792 --> 01:30:50,998
Hang on!

1199
01:30:54,500 --> 01:30:55,910
What's the matter?

1200
01:30:56,958 --> 01:30:59,290
I'll teach him a lesson, let's go...

1201
01:31:17,958 --> 01:31:19,949
Honey!

1202
01:31:24,583 --> 01:31:25,948
You so of a bitch, reading
the playboy again.

1203
01:31:25,958 --> 01:31:28,745
I'll cut you into pieces!

1204
01:31:40,875 --> 01:31:42,081
Here it is!

1205
01:31:46,833 --> 01:31:50,030
I've got to go at 12:00 pm sharp.

1206
01:31:51,417 --> 01:31:54,124
We won't be able to see each other again.

1207
01:31:54,375 --> 01:31:56,286
Keep an eye on the new born babies.

1208
01:31:56,292 --> 01:31:58,248
- Maybe I'll be one of them.
- Right!

1209
01:31:58,250 --> 01:31:59,581
Promise me one thing!

1210
01:32:00,083 --> 01:32:02,495
In the coming inter-school
100 metre spring semi-final.

1211
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:04,957
I hope you'll try your best to
win without my help.

1212
01:32:05,750 --> 01:32:08,787
Impossible, tarzen ko will win over me.

1213
01:32:09,417 --> 01:32:12,204
You'll succeed if you persevere and
have confidence.

1214
01:32:12,208 --> 01:32:13,698
I'm sure you'll win.

1215
01:32:13,708 --> 01:32:15,619
I'll give you my spiritual support.

1216
01:32:16,625 --> 01:32:18,081
It's time for me to go!

1217
01:32:22,208 --> 01:32:25,530
Good bye, my 3 darlings!

1218
01:32:27,083 --> 01:32:28,619
Scholar pik!

1219
01:32:31,250 --> 01:32:32,706
Scholar pik!

1220
01:32:33,042 --> 01:32:34,532
Scholar pik!

1221
01:33:19,708 --> 01:33:21,073
On your Mark!

1222
01:33:29,708 --> 01:33:30,868
Set!

1223
01:33:51,625 --> 01:33:54,492
Try your very best, I'm
sure you'll make it.

1224
01:34:10,875 --> 01:34:13,787
Scholar pik...

1225
01:34:14,542 --> 01:34:16,328
I made it!

1226
01:34:21,458 --> 01:34:22,618
Bonnie!

1227
01:34:22,875 --> 01:34:24,661
- One more!
- Here!

1228
01:34:28,583 --> 01:34:33,452
Although I have worked hard
I still failed in the exam.

1229
01:34:33,500 --> 01:34:35,616
However I'm very excited.

1230
01:34:35,625 --> 01:34:37,616
For I will represent Hong Kong.

1231
01:34:37,625 --> 01:34:40,037
In the Asian youth olympic games.

1232
01:34:43,542 --> 01:34:46,204
I am studying in teachers training school.

1233
01:34:46,208 --> 01:34:49,075
My ambition is to become a good teacher.

1234
01:34:49,083 --> 01:34:52,575
Besides, I met my better half.

1235
01:34:56,667 --> 01:34:58,874
Finally I got married with joesph.

1236
01:34:58,875 --> 01:35:02,538
He's working as a clerk in the central.

1237
01:35:02,542 --> 01:35:05,579
I gave birth to a 9 lb baby boy!

1238
01:35:05,583 --> 01:35:07,790
Look at your baby, he looks so weird.

1239
01:35:09,667 --> 01:35:11,623
Right, why is it like that?

1240
01:35:12,958 --> 01:35:15,745
It's very strange?

1241
01:35:16,417 --> 01:35:18,453
He looks like scholar pik!

1242
01:35:18,458 --> 01:35:20,119
Is it the reincarnation of scholar pik?

1243
01:35:21,583 --> 01:35:23,244
Bindeye pik!

1244
01:35:25,333 --> 01:35:26,869
Bindeye pik!

1245
01:35:26,875 --> 01:35:28,081
Call me dad!
