00:01:27,417 --> 00:01:28,875
Next, it's your turn

00:01:33,792 --> 00:01:35,667
Oh dear, it's dreadful, help!

00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,542

Otherwise, I would rather queue again

11
00:02:06,917 --> 00:02:08,083
OK!

12
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:10,958
When I was borne, the timing was bad

13
00:02:10,958 --> 00:02:12,792
It ruined my singing career

14
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:15,333
Therefore I committed suicide

15
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,417
You want to be a top singer?

16
00:02:17,417 --> 00:02:19,250

17
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,375
You'll be a professional singer

his wife sings the soprano

23
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:43,375
Corazon...

00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:46,000

You will be her daughter,

28
00:02:52,625 --> 00:02:54,333
you can sing endlessly from then on

29
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:57,625

35
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,500

59
00:04:38,292 --> 00:04:39,125

61
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,083

71
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,375

Hubby, hurry, it hurts!

75
00:05:13,125 --> 00:05:14,375

76
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,333
Halt...

77
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,083
What's the matter?

78
00:05:16,125 --> 00:05:17,000
What is it?

79
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,917

00:05:24,708 --> 00:05:26,750
- I'm giving birth now
- Don't pull the shirt!

83
00:05:28,292 --> 00:05:30,750
My girlfriend gave me this,

84
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:33,042
I promise to wear this to meet her

85
00:05:34,417 --> 00:05:37,500
Hubby, it's painful!

86
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,917
My girlfriend will kill me

87
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,542

88
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,375
Don't pull...

89
00:05:56,917 --> 00:05:59,125
Godfather, where's my mom?

90
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,167
I couldn't find her

91
00:06:00,167 --> 00:06:03,167
A silly man has sent
your mom to Sacred Heart hospital

92
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:07,167
Hurry, it's room I 8!

93

OK, bye!

94
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:13,917

00:06:13,917 --> 00:06:15,167
now try to abandon her!

96
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,250
I'll teach you a lesson if I could!

97
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,750
Go to hell!

98
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,125
Sorry...

99
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:26,167
Sorry!

100
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,875
L8, this is it

101
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,792
Doctor, my stomach is painful

102
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:07,667
Mom, here I am

103
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:14,083
My tummy hurts, ouch!

104
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,625
I feel a baby is moving

105
00:07:15,625 --> 00:07:17,250
A baby inside a man's womb?

106
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:19,125
There's something

107
00:07:19,125 --> 00:07:21,458
That wants to come out

108
00:07:21,542 --> 00:07:23,667
Incredible, a pregnant man!

109
00:07:23,667 --> 00:07:25,292
Hurry get the matron here!

110
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,542
Oh!

111
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:31,375
Don't move

112
00:07:31,375 --> 00:07:34,625
Something is blocking my chest. Now it's loosen

113
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:35,583
Let me check again

114
00:07:35,583 --> 00:07:37,958
My stomach is still in pain

115
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:40,083
Why, doctor?

116
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:44,375
Godfather, you trick me?

117
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:45,542
My mom is a man?

118
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:47,500
The man mixed up the room number

119
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,708
Your mom's in the last room round the corner

120
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,125
There isn't enough time, look!

121
00:07:57,292 --> 00:07:58,833
What then?

122
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,417
Wait for 3 more days

123
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:03,208
The best time is at 4 pm

124
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,833
Try again then

125
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:09,250
It's the silly man's fault

126
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:11,083
What's his name?

127
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,792
Hong Sam-kwai!

128
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,083
Mona, I'm late, sorry!

129
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,708
How late?

00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:43,458
1 more minute to an hour

131
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,167
Lucky I'm here for only 5 minutes,

132
00:08:46,167 --> 00:08:47,667

133
00:08:47,667 --> 00:08:49,000
I'm S o rry !

134
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,250
What happened? You have a fight?

135
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,375
No, I came from the hospital

136
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:55,708
Because of the fight?

137
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,625
No, I've sent a pregnant woman there

138
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,625
You've a pregnant woman?

139
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:00,542
I've nothing to do with her

140
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:03,000
Just met and she torn your shirt?

141
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,583
Kwai, you're lying, think of a better story

142
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,875

I ain't!

145
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,167
If you don't admit it, don't ever see me again!

146
00:09:13,167 --> 00:09:14,958
I am...

147
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,375
You admit you're lying now

148
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:17,875
Yes...

149
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:28,375
That's right, Young George Washington
confessing to cutting down a cherry tree.

150
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:31,125
Oh dear! I've hit the iron barrel

151
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,500
Come on, let's run

152
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:33,542

00:09:33,542 --> 00:09:34,708

154
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,375
You silly man!

155

You've to be adaptable

156
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,083
Now while nobody is watching, let's go!

157
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,583
Come on, start the car

158
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,042
Let's go!

Well done, Mr Hong!

162
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:26,875
He has style

163
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,500
Hi!

164
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,375
Oh dear

165
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,458
He winked at me!

166
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:56,375
Damn him if he's my student

167
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:17,375
Stop... you're out of tune!

168
00:11:26,042 --> 00:11:28,375
That's great

169
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:29,167
Quiet!

170
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:29,708
Too bad

171
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:32,583
What're you doing in here?

172
00:11:32,583 --> 00:11:33,625

173
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,250

Go sit to the corner

189
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:10,042
Damn it!

00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:21,750
No here, over that corner

194
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,667
the corner, you're kidding

195
00:12:23,667 --> 00:12:25,000
Where's my dignity?

196
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,833
If you don't, get the hell out of here

197
00:12:27,292 --> 00:12:28,625
Do as he says,

198
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:30,875
otherwise he'll have a heart attack

199
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,208
I saw the worse students

200
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,458
I'll give you a lesson

201
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,792
Boring!

202
00:12:37,792 --> 00:12:38,792
How old are you?

203
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:40,583
A year older than last year

204
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,583
The age?

205
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:43,375
19

206
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,375
Still at this class? What a shame!

207
00:12:45,375 --> 00:12:46,375
Why changed school?

208
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,875
Must have expelled

209
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:48,958
Why expelled?

210
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,000
Must have bad behaviours

211
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,083
Why behaved badly?

212
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,042
Must have terrible conduct

213
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,750
Your logic is quite something!

214
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,750
What have you planned for your future?

215
00:12:58,750 --> 00:12:59,667
You're incredible

216
00:12:59,667 --> 00:13:00,875
Go ahead with your logic

217
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,792
Asking me to plan it for you?

218
00:13:02,792 --> 00:13:05,375
You really have no brain

219
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:09,875
No ambition, no 1Q!

220
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,583
Attention!

221
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,750
Take him as an example

222
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,500
to warn yourself

223
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,917
You said I've low 1Q

224
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:21,333
can you spend the shortest time

225
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:23,167
to answer 3 simple questions

226
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:24,500
Of course

227
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,458
No 1, which months have 28 days?

228
00:13:27,667 --> 00:13:28,333
February!

229
00:13:28,333 --> 00:13:30,625
Wrong! Each month has 28 days

230
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,583
No 2, a bicycle is heading East,

231
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:34,583
the wind is blowing from North-east,

232
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:36,833
So which direction will the smoke go?

233
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:39,375
South-west!

234
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,292
Wrong! A bicycle doesn't emit smoke

235
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:44,917
These 2 questions,

236
00:13:44,917 --> 00:13:46,500
even an idiot can answer

237
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,917
Tell me your 1Q now,

238
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:49,042
high or low?

239
00:13:49,042 --> 00:13:49,833
Are you finished?

240
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:52,083
Not yet, one last question

241
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:53,583
What human organ, when stimulated,

242
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:55,208
will change in size

243
00:13:58,667 --> 00:14:00,333
I refuse to answer such a question

244
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,333
The right answer is the pupil

245
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,750
When it is stimulated,

246
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:05,625
it will dilate 7-times

247
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,375
My god, I'm on a different track too

248
00:14:09,417 --> 00:14:10,917
You refused to answer me,

249
00:14:10,917 --> 00:14:12,667
what was on your mind?!

250
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,667
Mr Hong, why are you so angry?

251
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:25,625
Of course, I'm angry

252
00:14:25,625 --> 00:14:28,208
The new student treated me badly

253
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,500
How?

254
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,083
Like a ball, being kicked and fooled around

255
00:14:32,708 --> 00:14:33,375
You...

256
00:14:33,375 --> 00:14:35,750
I only want a life

257
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,583
Let me off the corner of the street

258
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:43,708
At your age, you should get married

259
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:44,625
Really?

260
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:47,667
For a girl, external beauty is unimportant,

261
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:51,583
but, her personalities are

262
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:52,875
I agree

263
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:54,250
Kwai

264
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:57,125
Do I look like a suitable person?

265
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:00,583
I can't see anything

266
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:02,417
- I'm sorry!
- Where's my glasses?

267
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:05,208
I clean it for you!

268
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:13,833
It's OK now

269
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,208
Thanks!

270
00:15:23,167 --> 00:15:24,542
This pair of glasses

271
00:15:24,542 --> 00:15:25,542
makes me look younger, doesn't it?

272
00:15:25,542 --> 00:15:26,708
Yes...

273
00:15:27,917 --> 00:15:31,167
I don't know why,
I feel like having my own home

274
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:33,417
So I'm taking cookery lessons

275
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:35,333
Look at this cookery book

276
00:15:35,375 --> 00:15:36,875
The photos are nice

277
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:38,875
They will be nicer when cooked

278
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:39,958
Maybe you drop in one day

279
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,417
I will cook you a few dishes

280
00:15:41,417 --> 00:15:43,583
I will, here's you are

281
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,250
I will leave the book behind,

282
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,708
pick a few of your favourites,

283
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:51,542
and I can feed you personally

284
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,458
Your egg rolls

285
00:15:56,625 --> 00:15:58,125
It's for you

286
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,208
They're your favourite

287
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,542
Stop it! Please!

288
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:10,333
Wait!

289
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:15,125
What's hurry folk?

290
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:17,792
Not me, but my wife is in labour

291
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:19,833
It's you again?

292
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:20,958
You know each other?

293
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:21,708
No...

294
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,458
I gave her a ride to the hospital before

295
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:24,667
She didn't make it last time

296
00:16:24,667 --> 00:16:26,375
Please give us one more ride

297
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:28,958
My car broke down!

298
00:16:29,667 --> 00:16:32,750
But I'm in a hurry!

299
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,625
That's right, me too!

300
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:35,667
You!

301
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,625
Start the car, quick!

302
00:16:47,542 --> 00:16:49,958
Hubby, it's painful

303
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,000
Off your hand, I can't breath

304
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,125
Sorry for that

305
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:54,792
When she's in pain,

306
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:56,458
she thinks every man is her husband

307
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:58,000
Please drive faster

308
00:16:58,000 --> 00:16:59,833
It's the fastest, the car can go

309
00:17:12,292 --> 00:17:13,375
What's the matter?

310
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:14,333
A flat tyre!

311
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:14,917
Oh!

312
00:17:14,917 --> 00:17:17,000
Come and help to change it

313
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:20,125
Godfather, where's my mom?

314
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,000
She's with the silly man again

315
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,250
He got a flat tyre just now

316
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,292
What shall I do now?

317
00:17:25,292 --> 00:17:27,375
Go to his car and reborn there

318
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:30,458
It's awkward to be born in a car!

319
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,292
That's the way, it used to be

320
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:34,708
Go on, or it'll be too late

321
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:36,917
What a nuisance!

322
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:47,083
Ghost!

323
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,458
Come on, the baby is coming

324
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:54,417
Don't be nervous

325
00:17:54,417 --> 00:17:56,208
Let's hear some music

326
00:17:57,167 --> 00:18:00,333
Dear audience, tonight's song was from

327
00:18:00,542 --> 00:18:01,500
Just on time

328
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,083
a singer who had been ignored

329
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,292
Her name is Tsui Pan-han

330
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,417
The singer wasn't popular

331
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:15,125
Her song wasn't popular either,
no one wanted her Ips,

332
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,083
no one dated her

333
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:20,583
So she killed herself, with gas,

334
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:22,750
when she died, she was 21

335
00:18:23,417 --> 00:18:25,083
What a name she had chosen!

336
00:18:25,083 --> 00:18:28,125
"Pan-han" sounds like "go to heaven"

337
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:32,917
Please listen to her only song

338
00:18:32,917 --> 00:18:34,542
"The Crescent"

339
00:18:39,917 --> 00:18:41,583
What a terrible voice! Sounds like a chick,

340
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,458
no wonder she wasn't popular

341
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:44,958
Not too bad, actually it's quite good!

342
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,583
That's your opinion I can't bear it

343
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,458
Stop hitting or I'll get it even

344
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,292
Quiet!

345
00:19:02,292 --> 00:19:04,750
Let's hear the rest of the song

346
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,333
By my experience

347
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:12,083
Her song isn't bad, but it's a pity

348
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,042
Why?

349
00:19:13,042 --> 00:19:14,333
She's borne much too earlier

350
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,833
If she's born in this era,

351
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,833
she'll be the most popular singer

352
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,625
It's afternoon 1 minute past 4

353
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:29,125
The traffic condition of HK and Kowloon

354
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:34,333
Here we are

355
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,917
Get her out please

356
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,500
Godfather, I'm late again

357
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:42,375
I cannot reincarnate again

358
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,375
That's bad

359
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:45,333
You have to wait for another month

360
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,250
Come back then

361
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,250
No, I won't

362
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:50,583
That silly man again!

363
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:52,708
I've to get it even on him

364
00:20:28,667 --> 00:20:32,542
Mona... I'm sorry

365
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:34,333
What's your excuse?

366
00:20:35,292 --> 00:20:36,625
The pregnant woman again

367
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:37,875
Why, the pregnant woman again?

368
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,375
It's the same one

369
00:20:40,292 --> 00:20:41,542
After the first pregnancy,

370
00:20:41,542 --> 00:20:43,583
how come second pregnancy that soon?

371
00:20:43,583 --> 00:20:45,625
It's a medical question, I wouldn't know

372
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,917
Use your brain

373
00:20:48,917 --> 00:20:50,750
You're too lazy in finding a good excuse

374
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,833
It's true

375
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:53,708
Bullshit

376
00:20:53,708 --> 00:20:55,000
-ltisn't a lie
- It is!

377
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,917
- T isn't!
- It is!

378
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:56,958
It isn't!

379
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:58,250
I'll go if you deny it

380
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:00,542
It I1sS...

381
00:21:01,417 --> 00:21:03,042
Admit it is a lie?

382
00:21:03,042 --> 00:21:04,083
I admit it

383
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:07,208
You should admit earlier

384
00:21:07,208 --> 00:21:08,583
Let's go now

385
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,000
Rock Hudson!

386
00:21:21,042 --> 00:21:23,333
I'll call you, OK?

387
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,625
Good-bye!

388
00:21:25,292 --> 00:21:26,667
You know this transvestite?

389
00:21:26,667 --> 00:21:27,583
What transvestite?

390
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:29,250
He's my cousin from USA!

391
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:30,375
What a name!

392
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,083
Remember aids?

393
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:33,875
Ask him to change his surname,

394
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:34,958
or his first name

395
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,125
Superstitious!

396
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,083
Why is so windy suddenly?

397
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:54,583
You read this?

398
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,583
It isn't mine, it belongs to the headmistress

399
00:21:58,667 --> 00:21:59,917
That spinster?

400
00:21:59,917 --> 00:22:02,167
She's interested in this lately,

401
00:22:02,167 --> 00:22:03,708
and asked me to pick a few,

402
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,958
so she can teach me later

403
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,000
This belongs to her I suppose!

404
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:17,375
Yes it is, she took it off when she got in

405
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:18,583
and forgot when she left

406
00:22:18,583 --> 00:22:20,000
How come she took it off?

407
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,292
She got some powder in it

408
00:22:21,292 --> 00:22:24,000
So I took it off, and helped her to clean it

409
00:22:24,875 --> 00:22:26,167
You took it off?!

410
00:22:26,167 --> 00:22:28,333
Then she changed to a modern pair

411
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:30,250
and then she asked

412
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,000
whether she looked younger or not?

413
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,750
Isn't it funny?

414
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:36,375
What's so funny?

415
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:39,375
Why are you angry?

416
00:22:39,375 --> 00:22:40,875
It's normal

417
00:22:40,875 --> 00:22:41,917
You...

418
00:22:48,125 --> 00:22:50,333
Needless to say, she left these

419
00:22:51,667 --> 00:22:53,708
No these aren't hers, she left them for me

420
00:22:53,708 --> 00:22:55,125
For you?

421
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,500
She knew, they're my favourites

422
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:58,458
Your...?

423
00:22:58,458 --> 00:22:59,875
They're delicious

424
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:01,208
Try one yourself

425
00:23:01,208 --> 00:23:02,542
Stop the car

426
00:23:04,667 --> 00:23:06,917
Hong Sam-kwai, you're a sex maniac

427
00:23:06,917 --> 00:23:08,042
You are abnormal

428
00:23:08,042 --> 00:23:09,667
Don't come near me ever again!

429
00:23:10,125 --> 00:23:13,125
Why, eating egg rolls is abnormal?

430
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:17,583
Mona!

431
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,583
AWA4546, it's you again?

432
00:23:38,958 --> 00:23:44,250
Kwai, Kwai...

433
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:46,083
Give me a ride, OK?

434
00:23:46,083 --> 00:23:47,625
It's my girlfriend's birthday, I'm in hurry

435
00:23:47,625 --> 00:23:49,000
Last time, your egg rolls

436
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,667
caused me 3 days' explanation

437
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:54,375
Narrow mind

438
00:23:59,542 --> 00:24:00,833
Happy birthday!

439
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:04,750
I'll slice the cake, sit over there

440
00:24:10,417 --> 00:24:11,500
Don't turn round

441
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,333
Come, I'll show you something

442
00:24:16,292 --> 00:24:18,292
What're you doing?

443
00:24:18,292 --> 00:24:20,333
If you propose, face me

444
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:24,292
I love you, grant me super power

445
00:24:24,292 --> 00:24:25,708
What are you doing?

446
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,958
I love you

447
00:24:35,083 --> 00:24:38,333
When did you learn magic?

448
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:40,333
It isn't magic, it's super power

449
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:41,625
Super power?

450
00:24:41,833 --> 00:24:44,208
I was a happy ghost in my last life,

451
00:24:44,208 --> 00:24:46,500
he was good heart deeds me

452
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:49,375
super power since birth

453
00:24:49,375 --> 00:24:51,417
It's fun, once more!

454
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:52,417
OK!

455
00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:54,875
I love you!

456
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,833
It's fun

457
00:24:58,125 --> 00:24:59,375
I hate you

458
00:25:03,292 --> 00:25:06,875
I didn't mean it

459
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,375
You meant it!

460
00:25:09,375 --> 00:25:10,042
No, I didn't!

461
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:11,292
You're jealous of my cousin!

462
00:25:11,292 --> 00:25:12,583
No...

463
00:25:20,083 --> 00:25:23,125
How come, Mona!

464
00:25:23,292 --> 00:25:25,125
Mona, please stay Let me explain

465
00:26:09,208 --> 00:26:10,125
Yellow card

466
00:26:10,125 --> 00:26:11,625
What! Don't give me all those shit

467
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:13,208
No 2, out!

468
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:36,042
St York, St York,
you will lose like the egg yolk

469
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:38,792
Here, have some

470
00:26:39,333 --> 00:26:41,250
Not now!

471
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:47,208
Kwai, you have super power right?

472
00:26:47,208 --> 00:26:48,417
You're next in the game

473
00:26:48,417 --> 00:26:49,667
I don't

474
00:26:49,667 --> 00:26:51,042
If you don't join this game you'll be fired!

475
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:52,042
What did you say?

476
00:26:52,042 --> 00:26:54,083
No, it's a shame to lose

477
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:55,792
Please, I beg you!

478
00:26:55,958 --> 00:26:57,708
Alright...

479
00:27:02,208 --> 00:27:03,375
Super power

480
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:06,208
I love you

481
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:07,667
You're still here, Sir?

482
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:08,917
I'm looking for my glasses

483
00:27:08,917 --> 00:27:10,583
You're wearing it

484
00:27:11,042 --> 00:27:13,083
I meant my gloves actually

485
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:15,417
Do your best

486
00:27:15,917 --> 00:27:18,167
Do your best, Sir!

487
00:27:18,333 --> 00:27:22,125
Wong Tai Sin, ball into the net please

488
00:27:23,750 --> 00:27:24,833
We can't lose!

489
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:25,958
I can't disappoint them

490
00:27:25,958 --> 00:27:27,500
I can only rely on my super power

491
00:27:30,375 --> 00:27:33,417
Happy ghost, give me super power

492
00:27:36,542 --> 00:27:38,042
Please, my super power

493
00:27:38,042 --> 00:27:39,500
Come on, here's the ball

494
00:27:43,292 --> 00:27:44,958
OK...

495
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,583
Good... Sir...

496
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:39,333
Wait and see!

497
00:28:56,708 --> 00:28:58,167
"God bless you"

498
00:29:18,292 --> 00:29:19,500
"Born free"

499
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:29,417
Lost again

500
00:29:42,750 --> 00:29:44,083
What's wrong?

501
00:29:44,083 --> 00:29:45,333
12 yards

502
00:29:52,792 --> 00:29:54,083
"God bless you"

503
00:30:10,250 --> 00:30:11,500
"Born free"

504
00:30:19,167 --> 00:30:20,958
How come you've got the shoe?

505
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:22,542
I'm lost again

506
00:30:24,542 --> 00:30:25,958
Let's go!

507
00:30:46,875 --> 00:30:48,167
Pass it

508
00:30:53,625 --> 00:30:56,583
It's hers. It's his

509
00:31:11,708 --> 00:31:12,833
Sir!

510
00:31:20,083 --> 00:31:23,542
Dear, after school have a movie, OK?

511
00:31:28,333 --> 00:31:29,500
Sorry, I can't

512
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,542
I've a date tonight

513
00:31:30,542 --> 00:31:34,208
The note wasn't from me, it's from him

514
00:31:35,375 --> 00:31:37,208
You have special interest

515
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:40,083
Dating me and call me "dearie"

516
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:43,375
He isn't dating you, it's me

517
00:31:43,375 --> 00:31:45,000
No, it's...

518
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:45,792
Who?

519
00:31:45,792 --> 00:31:46,875
Me!

520
00:31:47,792 --> 00:31:50,667
No! Alan wants to date prefect

521
00:31:51,667 --> 00:31:53,208
OK, sit down!

522
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,542
I don't care who did this,

523
00:31:55,542 --> 00:31:58,292
but within the class
concentrate on your books only

524
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:00,167
nothing else!

525
00:32:00,417 --> 00:32:02,042
Prefect did a good job

526
00:32:02,042 --> 00:32:04,708
An example of being a good student

527
00:32:12,167 --> 00:32:15,583
Sir is right

528
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,875
I'm your example

529
00:32:17,875 --> 00:32:21,125
Whatever I do, follow me

530
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:24,042
Now, I want to sing and dance

531
00:32:24,458 --> 00:32:26,167
Follow me!

532
00:32:26,167 --> 00:32:28,000
OK, I'll

533
00:32:30,542 --> 00:32:31,708
"I want"

534
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:32,958
"I want"

535
00:32:33,417 --> 00:32:35,125
"I want you"

536
00:32:35,417 --> 00:32:36,792
"I want you"

537
00:32:36,833 --> 00:32:38,208
I want you, too!

538
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:44,375
"I want your love"

539
00:32:44,458 --> 00:32:47,667
"Why don't you come near to me?"

540
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:50,417
Tai Chuk-yee!

541
00:32:50,417 --> 00:32:53,292
This is the classroom, how can you do this?

542
00:32:54,750 --> 00:32:56,250
Come and see me in the office

543
00:32:57,208 --> 00:32:59,250
Shame on you, you're expelled

544
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,875
She usually behaves herself,

545
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:04,167
I think she is out of control

546
00:33:04,958 --> 00:33:06,750
Why?

547
00:33:06,750 --> 00:33:08,875
She is possessed by a spirit

548
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,167
A spirit?

549
00:33:15,208 --> 00:33:17,708
Kwai, we are all educated

550
00:33:17,708 --> 00:33:19,625
we should believe scientifically

551
00:33:19,625 --> 00:33:20,833
As a teacher,

552
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:23,250
how can you so superstitious?

553
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,542
Headmistress!

554
00:33:24,542 --> 00:33:25,917
If it is true

555
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:27,625
Why doesn't it possess me?

556
00:33:38,833 --> 00:33:40,125
"I want"

557
00:33:41,042 --> 00:33:42,708
"I want you..."

558
00:33:43,708 --> 00:33:49,125
"I want your love..."

559
00:33:49,417 --> 00:33:50,000
Oh dear!

560
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:51,917
"Why don't you come near to me"

561
00:33:51,917 --> 00:33:53,125
Cut it out, wake up!

562
00:33:53,208 --> 00:33:55,208
Damn you

563
00:34:00,125 --> 00:34:01,125
Why you hit me?

564
00:34:01,125 --> 00:34:02,667
You had been possessed

565
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:06,833
You show us your ass, shame on you

566
00:34:07,458 --> 00:34:09,000
Kwai, oh hear

567
00:34:10,542 --> 00:34:12,667
They saw everything

568
00:34:12,667 --> 00:34:13,792
I have to do something

569
00:34:13,792 --> 00:34:14,875
to get away this naughty ghost

570
00:34:14,875 --> 00:34:16,000
How?

571
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:16,875
Happy Ghost

572
00:34:16,875 --> 00:34:17,917
Who is Happy Ghost?

573
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:26,875
The temple of Happy Ghost was dismantled

574
00:34:27,833 --> 00:34:30,208
He likes living in
a bungalow instead of a temple

575
00:34:31,417 --> 00:34:37,583
Happy Ghost!

576
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:42,208
Happy Ghost!

577
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:46,875
Where are you?

578
00:34:48,292 --> 00:34:50,958
Be patient

579
00:34:51,208 --> 00:34:53,792
Come in! Let's happy together

580
00:34:57,458 --> 00:34:59,958
Are you alright?

581
00:34:59,958 --> 00:35:01,458
Did the headmistress punish you?

582
00:35:01,458 --> 00:35:04,792
She was insane just now

583
00:35:04,792 --> 00:35:06,542
You had been insane too

584
00:35:06,542 --> 00:35:07,667
What insane?

585
00:35:09,792 --> 00:35:11,833
Ladies, how about a ride

586
00:35:11,833 --> 00:35:14,375
I'm going. Are you going too?

587
00:35:14,375 --> 00:35:15,417
If prefect goes, we will

588
00:35:15,417 --> 00:35:16,500
Me too

589
00:35:16,708 --> 00:35:17,750
No, I'm not going

590
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:20,292
Come on, don't feel upset

591
00:35:25,167 --> 00:35:26,708
Get on?

592
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:28,250
That should be the right way

593
00:35:28,917 --> 00:35:29,667
Yes!

594
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:30,708
Quick!

595
00:35:30,917 --> 00:35:33,042
I don't feel like riding

596
00:35:33,042 --> 00:35:35,125
Why don't we go get some excitement

597
00:35:35,125 --> 00:35:36,833
Yes, I'll take you to a exciting place

598
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:39,208
A wonderful place
and you can earn money, alright?

599
00:35:40,375 --> 00:35:41,958
We've to change first?

600
00:35:41,958 --> 00:35:43,042
OK!

601
00:35:43,458 --> 00:35:44,875
What is an amusement centre?

602
00:35:44,875 --> 00:35:46,208
A porno centre

603
00:35:46,417 --> 00:35:48,625
A kiss, $10

604
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:01,917
You got some new girls, my lady killer

605
00:36:02,542 --> 00:36:04,458
You're that kind of person

606
00:36:05,250 --> 00:36:06,042
Where is big brother?

607
00:36:06,042 --> 00:36:07,167
In the room

608
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:08,667
Come, get in!

609
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,458
That's terrible. Let's go!

610
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:12,500
Don't be afraid, get in

611
00:36:12,583 --> 00:36:13,708
It was scary!

612
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:14,792
Go!

613
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:17,042
Big brother

614
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,625
Sweet kid, you're really something

615
00:36:20,625 --> 00:36:22,875
Tame 4 girls at the same time

616
00:36:22,875 --> 00:36:24,917
They said they want some excitement

617
00:36:24,917 --> 00:36:26,833
Surely, you will

618
00:36:26,833 --> 00:36:29,500
And you can earn more than $10,000 per month

619
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,375
We don't want it

620
00:36:31,542 --> 00:36:33,125
No one force you to do anything bad,

621
00:36:33,125 --> 00:36:35,458
come here when you want

622
00:36:35,458 --> 00:36:38,333
If you like it, come again

623
00:36:38,417 --> 00:36:39,875
I don't want to do it

624
00:36:39,875 --> 00:36:40,750
What's the matter?

625
00:36:40,750 --> 00:36:44,042
That maniac, he bruised my leg

626
00:36:44,042 --> 00:36:45,833
Send her to another client

627
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:48,708
But none of the girls wants to serve him

628
00:36:48,708 --> 00:36:49,875
Let me go!

629
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,167
Don't!

630
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:52,667
Get some money, why not?

631
00:36:52,667 --> 00:36:56,750
You've got the gut, send her to him

632
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,458
Charge double

633
00:36:58,458 --> 00:36:59,708
Follow me!

634
00:37:00,875 --> 00:37:02,625

638
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,833

639
00:37:19,667 --> 00:37:21,208

Nice leg

641
00:37:25,458 --> 00:37:27,125
A new girl indeed

642
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:29,125
Nice leg

643
00:37:35,833 --> 00:37:37,250

I'll beat you up

653
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,792
You said to beat them up

654
00:38:32,792 --> 00:38:36,625
Shut up. Turn on the light

655
00:38:37,167 --> 00:38:39,625

661
00:38:48,458 --> 00:38:50,417

662
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:53,375

How come there are so many cops?

699
00:40:20,958 --> 00:40:22,583
You called up the police

700
00:40:22,583 --> 00:40:23,875
Bullshit!

701
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:25,000

00:40:27,083 --> 00:40:29,542
Thanks auntie, let's go to police station now

705
00:40:33,292 --> 00:40:35,167
Although this frog already died

706
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:37,458
Its nervous system is still working

707
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:39,875
if it stimulate by electricity

708
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:42,500

709
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:44,583

00:40:44,583 --> 00:40:46,333
Now write out a report for me

711
00:41:00,625 --> 00:41:01,542
Hello!

712
00:41:03,958 --> 00:41:05,792
The frog is saying hello to me

713
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:07,500
How can a frog speak?

714
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,667
It's true

715
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,208
Anyone want to try again?

716
00:41:13,792 --> 00:41:14,750
Yes!

717
00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:23,750
Hello!

718
00:41:26,292 --> 00:41:27,292
Sir...

719
00:41:35,917 --> 00:41:37,333
What's the matter?

720
00:41:57,042 --> 00:42:00,042
Everybody leaves the room except prefect

721
00:42:11,375 --> 00:42:12,917
Show up now

722
00:42:14,083 --> 00:42:15,625
Who are you?

723
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:17,292
I am what I am

724
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:19,167
Let me show you something real tough

725
00:42:19,167 --> 00:42:20,500
You'll see

726
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:25,500
I love you!

727
00:42:25,750 --> 00:42:27,250
Give me the power

728
00:42:34,708 --> 00:42:36,042
I love you!

729
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,125
I hate you!

730
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:04,708
"God bless you"

731
00:43:19,417 --> 00:43:20,792
You know the same trick

732
00:43:20,792 --> 00:43:22,000
Who are you?

733
00:43:22,417 --> 00:43:26,583
I was a scholar
in Ching Dynasty name Chu Kam-chun

734
00:43:26,583 --> 00:43:28,917
Everyone calls me The Happy Ghost

735
00:43:28,917 --> 00:43:30,708
I'm his previous spirit

736
00:43:30,708 --> 00:43:32,333
He is my personification

737
00:43:32,333 --> 00:43:34,333
I don't care

738
00:43:34,333 --> 00:43:36,833
Mind your own business

739
00:43:37,042 --> 00:43:38,833
Don't blow up a small problem

740
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:41,375
It will never end

741
00:43:41,375 --> 00:43:42,958
Forgive him

742
00:43:42,958 --> 00:43:45,333
No, he delays
my schedule for reincarnation twice

743
00:43:45,333 --> 00:43:46,917
I must seek vengeance

744
00:43:46,917 --> 00:43:48,458
"Born free"

745
00:43:57,583 --> 00:43:58,833
Hello!

746
00:44:02,208 --> 00:44:03,458
Hello!

747
00:44:15,667 --> 00:44:16,958
"God bless you"

748
00:44:20,042 --> 00:44:23,750
If you don't give me face, don't blame me then

749
00:44:28,542 --> 00:44:30,375
I always care for girls

750
00:44:30,375 --> 00:44:31,583
but I've to break my rules this time

751
00:44:31,583 --> 00:44:32,917
I don't want it

752
00:44:32,917 --> 00:44:35,833
If you promise not to humiliate him again

753
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:38,167
I'll give you a chance

754
00:44:49,292 --> 00:44:51,417
"Born..."

755
00:44:55,083 --> 00:44:56,125
" ..Free"

756
00:45:15,458 --> 00:45:18,292
Stupid scholar, that's the end of the game

757
00:45:18,292 --> 00:45:20,708
See you

758
00:45:43,458 --> 00:45:44,583
Happy Ghost!

759
00:45:44,583 --> 00:45:46,125
Nice to see you here, my previous spirit

760
00:45:46,125 --> 00:45:48,417
Not to me, because of you

761
00:45:48,417 --> 00:45:51,083
My plait is being cut

762
00:45:51,458 --> 00:45:54,458
Without my plait, I don't have my super power

763
00:45:54,458 --> 00:45:57,083
No super power, I can't help you anymore

764
00:45:57,083 --> 00:45:58,792
How about my super power?

765
00:45:59,042 --> 00:46:00,583
I don't have the super power

766
00:46:00,583 --> 00:46:03,125
Of course you don't have it too

767
00:46:03,458 --> 00:46:05,542
What are we going to do with her?

768
00:46:05,583 --> 00:46:07,042
I don't know!

769
00:46:07,042 --> 00:46:09,875
You delayed
her schedule for reincarnation twice

770
00:46:10,250 --> 00:46:12,000
She will kill me

771
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,417
She doesn't want to kill you

772
00:46:13,417 --> 00:46:15,417
She just wants to annoy you

773
00:46:15,458 --> 00:46:17,417
That's even worse

774
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,375
Help me, please

775
00:46:21,083 --> 00:46:22,167
Listen!

776
00:46:22,542 --> 00:46:25,917
Win her heart with love!

777
00:46:26,792 --> 00:46:27,667
Love?!

778
00:46:28,625 --> 00:46:30,625
She didn't have an affair when she was alive

779
00:46:30,625 --> 00:46:32,708
If there's a fool fall in love with her,

780
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:34,958
will solve this problem

781
00:46:34,958 --> 00:46:37,417
I've a girlfriend, and she is a ghost

782
00:46:37,417 --> 00:46:40,208
Don't talk about your girl .
You're so scared of her

783
00:46:40,208 --> 00:46:42,292
Even I feel ashamed of you

784
00:46:42,458 --> 00:46:45,458
Remember, she'll have a month time

785
00:46:45,458 --> 00:46:47,625
Tell her you like her

786
00:46:47,625 --> 00:46:49,750
no matter it's true or not,

787
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:53,000
you'll be free in a month time

788
00:46:53,125 --> 00:46:55,583
Because of your students and yourself

789
00:46:55,583 --> 00:46:59,167
I'm going to like her songs

790
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:07,250
"Like the crescent on the sky"

791
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:13,083
"Hanging alone in the air"

792
00:47:13,250 --> 00:47:19,542
"Wish you could join me in the darkness"

793
00:47:19,667 --> 00:47:25,250
"With you, the sky will lighten up"

794
00:47:25,375 --> 00:47:31,250
"Now the crescent is disappeared"

795
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:34,667
"It is hidden behind the clouds"

796
00:47:34,667 --> 00:47:36,667
Time's up...

797
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:43,792
Where are you going after class?

798
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:44,792
Whatever you like

799
00:47:44,792 --> 00:47:45,750
Let's go watch some movies

800
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:46,542
What are we going to watch?

801
00:47:46,542 --> 00:47:47,708
Yui King!

802
00:47:47,833 --> 00:47:48,958
Did you see Tai, the prefect

803
00:47:48,958 --> 00:47:50,500
She is alone in the hall

804
00:47:50,500 --> 00:47:51,500
Thanks!

805
00:47:51,708 --> 00:47:54,750
"Hoping that one day I'll be the moon"

806
00:47:54,750 --> 00:48:00,625
"To light up the sky"

807
00:48:00,625 --> 00:48:06,792
"I am so despair at this moment"

808
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:12,958
"How shall I fight against the misfortune"

809
00:48:12,958 --> 00:48:19,208
"Look at the crescent"

810
00:48:19,875 --> 00:48:21,333
Tsui Pan-han!

811
00:48:22,667 --> 00:48:24,292
You finally find out

812
00:48:24,292 --> 00:48:26,167
Stop bothering my student

813
00:48:26,167 --> 00:48:28,000
She's innocent

814
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:30,958
If you still want to play this game, come to me

815
00:48:30,958 --> 00:48:32,458
You want me to possess you?

816
00:48:32,458 --> 00:48:34,208
Yes, Han!

817
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:36,458
This bunch of flowers is for you

818
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:41,917
I got a hard time

819
00:48:41,917 --> 00:48:44,792
to have one of your record and your poster

820
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,208
And I listen to your song
each night I can't sleep

821
00:48:48,208 --> 00:48:51,250
I've nightmare without seeing your poster

822
00:48:52,167 --> 00:48:56,208
I know I'm in love with you

823
00:49:01,542 --> 00:49:04,208
Miss, do you know where's Hon Sum-kwai?

824
00:49:04,208 --> 00:49:04,875
Who are you?

825
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:06,500
I'm the headmistress of this school

826
00:49:06,875 --> 00:49:08,250
I'm his girlfriend, Mona!

827
00:49:08,250 --> 00:49:09,667
Headmistress, it is terrible!

828
00:49:09,750 --> 00:49:10,458
What's happening?

829
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:11,750
Mr Hon is flattering a student

830
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:13,458
Trying to do something immoral

831
00:49:23,542 --> 00:49:24,833
Possess me

832
00:49:24,833 --> 00:49:27,458
Come to me

833
00:49:27,458 --> 00:49:28,667
But your girlfriend...

834
00:49:28,667 --> 00:49:30,208
I don't care about her

835
00:49:30,208 --> 00:49:31,792
She's a dumb

836
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:34,542
How about the headmistress?

837
00:49:35,458 --> 00:49:37,375
She loves me

838
00:49:37,375 --> 00:49:38,750
But I don't, men scare her

839
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:40,208
she'll be a old maiden for her life

840
00:49:40,208 --> 00:49:42,292
If you love me

841
00:49:42,292 --> 00:49:44,167
show me something in action

842
00:49:44,167 --> 00:49:45,458
Action?

843
00:49:45,625 --> 00:49:46,875
Kiss me!

844
00:49:50,417 --> 00:49:51,292
If you don't kiss me

845
00:49:51,292 --> 00:49:54,792
that means all your words are flowering only

846
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:06,250
Kwai, damn you

847
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,500
Mona...

848
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,958
You are a teacher
and try to tempt an underage girl

849
00:50:09,958 --> 00:50:11,250
You are not a human!

850
00:50:11,250 --> 00:50:13,167
You're bastard

851
00:50:13,333 --> 00:50:14,625
Listen to me

852
00:50:14,625 --> 00:50:16,167
Now I know why you heckle me often

853
00:50:16,167 --> 00:50:17,708
cause you want to pull my leg

854
00:50:17,708 --> 00:50:18,750
You're doing this to the perfect

855
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:19,958
Why not me?

856
00:50:19,958 --> 00:50:20,750
That's unfair

857
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:21,792
You all misunderstood

858
00:50:21,792 --> 00:50:23,833
No need to explain, we are finished

859
00:50:23,833 --> 00:50:26,000
You're fired

860
00:50:27,167 --> 00:50:30,667
Listen to me

861
00:50:33,292 --> 00:50:35,000
You ruined me

862
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,250
Are you happy now?

863
00:51:21,167 --> 00:51:22,833
The No 1 in our Pop chart this week

864
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:25,042
is Tsui Pan-han "The Crescent"

865
00:51:25,042 --> 00:51:27,625
No one noticed this old song 20 years ago

866
00:51:27,625 --> 00:51:29,750
That's a miracle it's popular now

867
00:51:29,750 --> 00:51:32,042
Let me tell you this story

868
00:51:32,042 --> 00:51:33,625
A month ago

869
00:51:33,625 --> 00:51:36,292
My programme for oldies I introduced this song

870
00:51:36,292 --> 00:51:38,167
An audience called Hon

871
00:51:38,167 --> 00:51:39,958
he loved this song

872
00:51:39,958 --> 00:51:41,750
and came to visit me purposely

873
00:51:41,750 --> 00:51:43,708
and asked me to sell this record to him

874
00:51:43,708 --> 00:51:46,458
I was wondering then
I listened to this song again

875
00:51:46,458 --> 00:51:49,083
and found that it was wonderful

876
00:51:49,083 --> 00:51:51,542
so I'm introducing to the audience

877
00:51:52,208 --> 00:51:54,542
and don't know it'll be accepted

878
00:51:54,542 --> 00:52:00,333
"Like the crescent on the sky"

879
00:52:00,333 --> 00:52:06,292
"Hanging alone in the air"

880
00:52:06,333 --> 00:52:12,750
"Wish you could join me in the darkness"

881
00:52:38,667 --> 00:52:43,083
You made me lost the job

882
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:45,167
and my girlfriend

883
00:52:45,167 --> 00:52:47,583
now not even let me shave

884
00:52:49,167 --> 00:52:51,208
what do you want?

885
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:58,917
Don't come near me

886
00:52:58,917 --> 00:53:01,042
-I want...
- Don't...

887
00:53:06,667 --> 00:53:08,000
Don't come over

888
00:53:10,042 --> 00:53:11,708
I'm sorry

889
00:53:11,708 --> 00:53:12,958
I don't mean it

890
00:53:12,958 --> 00:53:14,583
to make you in such a bad situation

891
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,167
I don't mean it

892
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:26,708
I only want to help you

893
00:53:37,458 --> 00:53:39,833
Stop bothering my student

894
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:42,375
I wouldn't

895
00:53:44,250 --> 00:53:44,958
I wouldn't

896
00:53:44,958 --> 00:53:46,667
You're so nice

897
00:53:47,542 --> 00:53:49,792
Have a sip of wine to calm you down

898
00:53:54,167 --> 00:53:55,333
I'm glad,

899
00:53:55,333 --> 00:53:57,208
because of you, my song becomes popular now

900
00:53:57,208 --> 00:53:59,375
I don't know how to thank you

901
00:54:01,375 --> 00:54:02,875
Well, don't mention it

902
00:54:02,875 --> 00:54:04,667
Stop fooling around me

903
00:54:04,667 --> 00:54:05,750
I wouldn't

904
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:07,542
I wouldn't, I can swear

905
00:54:09,958 --> 00:54:11,792
I'm sorry. Let me help you

906
00:54:11,792 --> 00:54:13,125
I can do it myself

907
00:54:15,167 --> 00:54:17,083
Strange, your song becomes popular now

908
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,583
Is it good or not?

909
00:54:18,583 --> 00:54:19,542
Good!

910
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,583
I remember what you said I sang like a chick

911
00:54:21,583 --> 00:54:22,542
But sometimes even a chick

912
00:54:22,542 --> 00:54:23,792
can chirps well

913
00:54:26,208 --> 00:54:28,042
Don't drink alone

914
00:54:28,042 --> 00:54:29,958
Let's get something to eat

915
00:54:31,958 --> 00:54:33,750
For what I did to you

916
00:54:50,625 --> 00:54:52,250
I haven't eaten in the Street for a long time

917
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:55,333
my girlfriend thinks
it's too dirty, she doesn't like it

918
00:54:56,958 --> 00:54:59,583
I like it. It is so traditional

919
00:55:00,208 --> 00:55:01,250
Alone?

920
00:55:01,667 --> 00:55:02,750
Two!

921
00:55:03,375 --> 00:55:05,958
Two? Where is the other?

922
00:55:07,292 --> 00:55:09,500
Only one at the moment

923
00:55:15,167 --> 00:55:16,083
Charm them

924
00:55:16,083 --> 00:55:17,542
Let them see you too,

925
00:55:17,542 --> 00:55:20,083
otherwise, they think that I'm insane

926
00:55:20,583 --> 00:55:21,667
Alright

927
00:55:29,375 --> 00:55:30,792
OK

928
00:55:33,500 --> 00:55:34,958
Here comes your girlfriend

929
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:37,500
What do you want?

930
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,542
You order

931
00:55:39,125 --> 00:55:39,958
Fried beef with vegetable!

932
00:55:39,958 --> 00:55:41,083
Egg and tomato!

933
00:55:41,417 --> 00:55:42,750
Spareribs!

934
00:55:42,750 --> 00:55:43,542
Anything else?

935
00:55:43,542 --> 00:55:44,292
Have it first

936
00:55:44,292 --> 00:55:45,458
Will be ready soon

937
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:51,500
Stop looking around

938
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,875
- Here is a seat.
- Right!

939
00:55:53,875 --> 00:55:56,875
Actually a good timing
is not essential for reincarnation

940
00:55:56,875 --> 00:55:58,042
A man's success depends on

941
00:55:58,042 --> 00:55:59,875
how much effort you've worked hard

942
00:55:59,875 --> 00:56:01,042
Who says that?

943
00:56:01,042 --> 00:56:03,625
Why someone born to be a king?

944
00:56:03,625 --> 00:56:05,375
And the others are beggars

945
00:56:05,375 --> 00:56:07,250
If you still believe in this,

946
00:56:07,250 --> 00:56:08,500
that's superstition

947
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,250
Hey!

948
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:13,250
That man is talking to himself

949
00:56:13,250 --> 00:56:14,500
He must be crazy

950
00:56:14,500 --> 00:56:16,000
Have a slice of tomato

951
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:19,000
No. That's her girlfriend

952
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,458
Eat

953
00:56:21,458 --> 00:56:23,083
You busy body

954
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:25,750
Spareribs, you favourite

955
00:56:29,208 --> 00:56:30,417
Madam!

956
00:56:30,417 --> 00:56:32,333
Is that man crazy?

957
00:56:34,708 --> 00:56:36,208
You forget to charm that one

958
00:56:36,208 --> 00:56:38,042
Charm him then

959
00:56:38,750 --> 00:56:40,375
It's none of your business

960
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:47,292
This is for you

961
00:56:47,375 --> 00:56:48,958
Which one?

962
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:52,375
The one is strap

963
00:56:54,000 --> 00:56:55,750
You're crazy

964
00:56:55,750 --> 00:56:59,417
He is serving his girlfriend

965
00:56:59,792 --> 00:57:01,750
Something's wrong with my eyes

966
00:57:01,750 --> 00:57:03,417
Take me to a ophthalmology

967
00:57:03,417 --> 00:57:05,125
You watched too much "World Cup" satellite

968
00:57:11,833 --> 00:57:14,042
So sweet

969
00:57:54,458 --> 00:57:57,750
"Happiness is romancing in the rain"

970
00:57:57,750 --> 00:58:01,167
"Trying to be innocent, wind on my face"

971
00:58:01,167 --> 00:58:04,542
"Happiness is whispering to lover at night"

972
00:58:04,542 --> 00:58:07,458
"Not to fear or worry"

973
00:58:09,500 --> 00:58:12,667
"Happiness is swimming together at night"

974
00:58:12,667 --> 00:58:16,000
"Tear off the masks, frolic on the sand"

975
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,417
"Happiness is sitting alone in the rain”

976
00:58:19,417 --> 00:58:22,792
"crying but it is fun"

977
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:26,250
"Everyone is nicely dressed up"

978
00:58:26,625 --> 00:58:29,417
"Help yourself whatever you please"

979
00:58:29,958 --> 00:58:32,583
"Nice legs behind the long skirt"

980
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:36,458
"Dancing crazily without fear"

981
00:58:36,708 --> 00:58:39,750
"Lovers leave the foot-steps on the sand"

982
00:58:40,125 --> 00:58:43,125
"Why the steps chasing after us"

983
00:58:43,417 --> 00:58:46,458
"It makes my soul dancing onto heaven"

984
00:58:46,708 --> 00:58:49,375
"It is fun to be so happy"

985
00:58:49,917 --> 00:58:51,625
"Be happy while you're young"

986
00:58:51,625 --> 00:58:53,333
"Send away all your loneliness now"

987
00:58:53,333 --> 00:58:56,625
"Try to understand what happiness is"

988
00:58:56,625 --> 00:58:58,375
"Send away despair"

989
00:58:58,375 --> 00:59:00,083
"Send away all your loneliness now"

990
00:59:00,083 --> 00:59:03,375
"You'll be in a state of fantasy”

991
00:59:03,375 --> 00:59:05,125
"Be happy while you're young"

992
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:06,792
"Send away all your loneliness now"

993
00:59:06,792 --> 00:59:10,167
"Try to understand what happiness is"

994
00:59:10,167 --> 00:59:11,833
"Send away despair"

995
00:59:11,833 --> 00:59:13,542
"Send away all your loneliness now"

996
00:59:13,542 --> 00:59:16,792
"You'll be in a state of fantasy”

997
00:59:16,833 --> 00:59:18,542
"Be happy while you're young"

998
00:59:18,542 --> 00:59:20,250
"Send away all your loneliness now"

999
00:59:20,250 --> 00:59:23,625
"Try to understand what happiness is"

1000
00:59:23,625 --> 00:59:25,292
"Send away despair"

1001
00:59:25,292 --> 00:59:27,000
"Send away all your loneliness now"

1002
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,625
"You'll be in a state of fantasy”

1003
00:59:34,792 --> 00:59:36,792
Pity, he becomes crazy because of me

1004
00:59:41,750 --> 00:59:43,917
Big brother...

1005
00:59:45,375 --> 00:59:47,250
How are you? Tomorrow will be better

1006
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:48,792
Big brother...

1007
00:59:48,958 --> 00:59:50,750
You're not in a good mood

1008
00:59:51,583 --> 00:59:53,875
That woman stirred me up, my place closed down

1009
00:59:53,875 --> 00:59:55,417
I'm imprisoned for a month

1010
00:59:55,417 --> 00:59:56,833
I want the revenge

1011
00:59:56,833 --> 00:59:58,792
I suspect she knows witchcraft

1012
00:59:58,792 --> 01:00:00,917
maybe she have a possession

1013
01:00:10,792 --> 01:00:16,542
This cross can exorcise

1014
01:00:16,542 --> 01:00:20,417
can also diminish the charms

1015
01:00:28,750 --> 01:00:31,958
Then use this axe punch into her heart

1016
01:00:31,958 --> 01:00:34,208
she will disappear forever

1017
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:36,667
Can never reincarnation again

1018
01:00:40,708 --> 01:00:45,375
Prefect, go to the back door,

1019
01:00:45,375 --> 01:00:46,958
don't get out at the front door

1020
01:00:47,167 --> 01:00:48,000
Why?

1021
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,542
A bad guy is waiting you there

1022
01:00:49,542 --> 01:00:51,875
Let's get out at the back door then

1023
01:00:52,917 --> 01:00:54,417
When the crooked asks you
to get out at the back door

1024
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:56,083
you've to take the front door

1025
01:00:56,792 --> 01:00:57,542
Let's go!

1026
01:00:57,542 --> 01:00:58,750
Go!

1027
01:01:08,958 --> 01:01:10,000
Prefect!

1028
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:13,375
Get in, quick

1029
01:01:23,625 --> 01:01:25,083
What do you want?

1030
01:01:25,667 --> 01:01:28,292
You made me imprisoned

1031
01:01:28,292 --> 01:01:29,750
you have to pay for it

1032
01:01:29,750 --> 01:01:30,750
None of my business!

1033
01:01:30,750 --> 01:01:33,042
You ask for it, you deserve it

1034
01:01:33,042 --> 01:01:34,500
You shut up!

1035
01:01:38,042 --> 01:01:39,333
See what you can say?

1036
01:01:39,333 --> 01:01:40,417
You are such a bad guy

1037
01:01:40,417 --> 01:01:41,292
like cancer of the human

1038
01:01:41,292 --> 01:01:42,750
Bastard, Bastard

1039
01:01:42,750 --> 01:01:44,042
It doesn't work

1040
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:46,083
she is so furious

1041
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:47,583
Let me try!

1042
01:01:48,583 --> 01:01:51,500
Big brother, my cross is better

1043
01:01:53,125 --> 01:01:55,125
Damn kid, don't get high

1044
01:01:55,792 --> 01:01:57,292
I'll give you a injection

1045
01:01:57,292 --> 01:01:59,333
which make you feel so bad

1046
01:01:59,333 --> 01:02:00,833
You'll kneel down to beg me then

1047
01:02:00,833 --> 01:02:02,042
Good ideal!

1048
01:02:02,375 --> 01:02:04,083
Big brother, don't do that

1049
01:02:04,083 --> 01:02:05,250
Go away!

1050
01:02:06,083 --> 01:02:07,875
It will be your turn soon

1051
01:02:22,333 --> 01:02:23,333
Shit!

1052
01:02:23,542 --> 01:02:24,875
I'm sorry

1053
01:02:28,417 --> 01:02:29,667
Damn shit!

1054
01:02:31,833 --> 01:02:32,958
Give her another injection

1055
01:02:32,958 --> 01:02:35,167
Big brother,
we have no more, this is the last one!

1056
01:02:35,167 --> 01:02:37,583
But the pin is still in your ass

1057
01:02:37,875 --> 01:02:39,542
You are all jerks

1058
01:02:39,542 --> 01:02:41,458
Go and get me a basket of pins

1059
01:02:46,083 --> 01:02:48,667
I'm getting to like you more

1060
01:02:49,083 --> 01:02:50,208
Really?

1061
01:02:50,208 --> 01:02:53,500
If you help me to mend all these torn trousers

1062
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:55,583
You're even better

1063
01:03:00,375 --> 01:03:02,042
Have a sip of soft drink

1064
01:03:03,333 --> 01:03:07,458
"I love you"!

1065
01:03:07,458 --> 01:03:11,125
Excuse me, I cut your previous spirit's plait,

1066
01:03:11,125 --> 01:03:13,167
you lost your super power

1067
01:03:13,833 --> 01:03:15,208
You want to open the door of fringe?

1068
01:03:15,208 --> 01:03:18,000
I'll help you

1069
01:03:27,542 --> 01:03:29,083
Your hands just like a magnet

1070
01:03:29,083 --> 01:03:31,042
you can pick up anything of iron

1071
01:03:31,042 --> 01:03:32,083
Really?

1072
01:03:33,208 --> 01:03:34,500
Open the ice box!

1073
01:03:37,167 --> 01:03:38,333
Soft drink!

1074
01:03:42,375 --> 01:03:43,667
Beer!

1075
01:03:45,292 --> 01:03:46,500
That's terrific

1076
01:03:48,333 --> 01:03:49,417
Cheer!

1077
01:03:52,042 --> 01:03:53,292
Who's coming?

1078
01:04:00,417 --> 01:04:02,250
Please hide up for a while

1079
01:04:11,208 --> 01:04:14,542
Kwai, are you alright?

1080
01:04:14,833 --> 01:04:17,458
I brought you some chickens

1081
01:04:18,375 --> 01:04:19,667
I'm alright

1082
01:04:24,833 --> 01:04:26,208
Go!

1083
01:04:30,417 --> 01:04:34,625
You look tired

1084
01:04:34,708 --> 01:04:37,125
It's because of me

1085
01:04:37,125 --> 01:04:39,250
so I am going to make you some chicken soup

1086
01:04:41,792 --> 01:04:43,250
Who is she?

1087
01:04:48,125 --> 01:04:51,875
You, go away please!

1088
01:04:51,875 --> 01:04:54,667
Kwai!

1089
01:04:58,958 --> 01:05:00,708
Who is she?

1090
01:05:01,083 --> 01:05:05,250
She is my mom

1091
01:05:06,292 --> 01:05:08,375
My mom used to be a singer

1092
01:05:08,667 --> 01:05:09,333
That's good

1093
01:05:09,333 --> 01:05:10,958
Let me prepare the soup

1094
01:05:19,417 --> 01:05:20,708
Kwai!

1095
01:05:22,208 --> 01:05:23,833
I'm doing Tai Chi

1096
01:05:29,042 --> 01:05:32,333
I beg you to the toilet please

1097
01:05:53,458 --> 01:05:58,667
Help...

1098
01:06:01,833 --> 01:06:03,250
Mona...

1099
01:06:13,625 --> 01:06:15,208
Stop playing

1100
01:06:15,708 --> 01:06:19,042
Don't be afraid, I get you a cup of hot tea

1101
01:06:31,042 --> 01:06:32,708
If you keep on using the super power

1102
01:06:32,708 --> 01:06:34,167
I'll not see you again

1103
01:06:34,167 --> 01:06:35,875
I'll fetch you a towel

1104
01:06:38,125 --> 01:06:40,208
Stop fooling around

1105
01:06:43,042 --> 01:06:44,208
How come there's a woman's invoice?

1106
01:06:44,208 --> 01:06:46,208
It's from the tap only

1107
01:06:46,458 --> 01:06:47,542
Go away!

1108
01:06:51,708 --> 01:06:53,458
I'm going to have a bath

1109
01:07:00,333 --> 01:07:03,708
I misunderstood you, Kwai!

1110
01:07:05,792 --> 01:07:06,708
In the bedroom!

1111
01:07:06,708 --> 01:07:09,042
No one is in

1112
01:07:18,458 --> 01:07:20,917
You're hiding that foxy woman?

1113
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,083
She is not a fox,

1114
01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:23,792
she is a ghost

1115
01:07:23,792 --> 01:07:25,083
Stop lying to me

1116
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:27,333
I already give you a chance

1117
01:07:27,333 --> 01:07:28,917
I'm so disappointed

1118
01:07:28,917 --> 01:07:30,500
Let's break up

1119
01:07:30,500 --> 01:07:31,917
I'll go to USA with my cousin

1120
01:07:31,917 --> 01:07:33,583
Mona, let me explain

1121
01:07:41,708 --> 01:07:45,000
Tsui, you go too far

1122
01:07:45,667 --> 01:07:47,417
You know a bit of those trick

1123
01:07:47,417 --> 01:07:49,208
and do what you like to do

1124
01:07:49,208 --> 01:07:52,208
You're jealous, narrow mind,

1125
01:07:52,208 --> 01:07:53,875
you're not cute at all

1126
01:07:54,375 --> 01:07:55,917
you think you can sing?

1127
01:07:55,917 --> 01:07:59,417
No, your voice sounds like a chicken

1128
01:07:59,417 --> 01:08:02,083
It's terrible I have a nightmare

1129
01:08:02,958 --> 01:08:04,375
Do you think I like you?

1130
01:08:04,375 --> 01:08:05,750
That's not true

1131
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:08,917
I am cheating you,

1132
01:08:08,917 --> 01:08:10,208
SO you can reincarnate quicker

1133
01:08:10,208 --> 01:08:12,083
and leave me alone

1134
01:08:41,417 --> 01:08:46,333
Han...

1135
01:08:50,542 --> 01:08:55,542
Please don't go

1136
01:08:55,958 --> 01:08:57,333
Driver, stop...

1137
01:08:58,583 --> 01:09:02,708
Han, please stay!

1138
01:09:02,833 --> 01:09:04,042
Go on!

1139
01:09:05,833 --> 01:09:07,750
I don't mean it

1140
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:09,875
You sing well

1141
01:09:09,875 --> 01:09:11,833
You're so cute

1142
01:09:11,917 --> 01:09:13,292
Han...

1143
01:09:17,625 --> 01:09:20,083
Han, you...

1144
01:09:20,083 --> 01:09:21,750
Sir, the prefect is being kidnapped

1145
01:09:21,750 --> 01:09:22,792
Go and save her

1146
01:09:22,792 --> 01:09:23,958
Let's go

1147
01:09:23,958 --> 01:09:24,833
Come on!

1148
01:09:31,958 --> 01:09:32,542
Hello!

1149
01:09:32,542 --> 01:09:34,917
Tonight at 10

1150
01:09:34,917 --> 01:09:36,125
It's a good time for reincarnation

1151
01:09:36,125 --> 01:09:37,500
You still have an hour

1152
01:09:37,500 --> 01:09:38,833
If you lose this chance again

1153
01:09:38,833 --> 01:09:40,917
you won't have another one

1154
01:09:51,292 --> 01:09:54,458
Choose a big one for her

1155
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:01,250
This way!

1156
01:10:06,167 --> 01:10:08,833
Help!

1157
01:10:08,833 --> 01:10:09,458
Here they are

1158
01:10:09,458 --> 01:10:10,125
Let's go in

1159
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:11,333
No, I called the police already

1160
01:10:11,333 --> 01:10:12,417
We better wait

1161
01:10:12,417 --> 01:10:13,708
It'll be too late,

1162
01:10:13,708 --> 01:10:15,125
if we wait for the police to come

1163
01:10:22,583 --> 01:10:23,708
No not

1164
01:10:23,708 --> 01:10:24,542
Sir!

1165
01:10:24,542 --> 01:10:26,208
Don't be afraid, the police is coming,

1166
01:10:26,208 --> 01:10:27,708
release her now

1167
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:30,667
Throw him down the street

1168
01:10:30,667 --> 01:10:31,708
Yes!

1169
01:10:32,958 --> 01:10:34,167
Don't!

1170
01:10:35,167 --> 01:10:36,542
Throw him down the street

1171
01:10:36,917 --> 01:10:38,042
Keep quiet!

1172
01:10:38,333 --> 01:10:39,292
Hon Sir!

1173
01:10:40,458 --> 01:10:41,875
Damn you!

1174
01:10:43,667 --> 01:10:44,792
Hon Sir!

1175
01:10:50,458 --> 01:10:51,583
Han!

1176
01:10:51,583 --> 01:10:53,542
Han, Han, I come just in time,

1177
01:10:53,542 --> 01:10:55,333
otherwise, you will die for sure

1178
01:10:56,750 --> 01:10:58,750
Let's go up and save them

1179
01:10:58,917 --> 01:10:59,792
OK!

1180
01:11:13,458 --> 01:11:14,667
Catch him

1181
01:11:16,708 --> 01:11:18,042
"God bless you"

1182
01:11:30,042 --> 01:11:31,292
"Born free"

1183
01:11:36,667 --> 01:11:37,792
Go

1184
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:39,042
Go

1185
01:12:11,667 --> 01:12:12,542
Move

1186
01:12:12,542 --> 01:12:13,458
Big brother!

1187
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:33,458
I'm so scared

1188
01:13:17,333 --> 01:13:20,125
Take off the strip

1189
01:13:24,750 --> 01:13:26,250
How come?

1190
01:13:26,250 --> 01:13:28,292
You're helped by a naughty ghost

1191
01:13:28,292 --> 01:13:29,375
Where's it?

1192
01:13:29,375 --> 01:13:30,708
She is right here

1193
01:13:33,167 --> 01:13:34,125
You can't see her

1194
01:13:34,125 --> 01:13:35,333
Only I can

1195
01:13:35,333 --> 01:13:36,875
Help me to get rid of this

1196
01:13:36,875 --> 01:13:37,750
Please don't...

1197
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:38,917
Look!

1198
01:13:38,917 --> 01:13:44,250
No...

1199
01:13:46,750 --> 01:13:49,958
I don't want to continue

1200
01:13:51,833 --> 01:13:53,833
It's so painful

1201
01:14:27,125 --> 01:14:28,250
Help!

1202
01:14:46,333 --> 01:14:48,542
You go, son of a bitch

1203
01:14:48,542 --> 01:14:50,375
You've going too

1204
01:14:55,333 --> 01:14:56,708
Please don't!

1205
01:15:07,542 --> 01:15:09,708
Don't come over

1206
01:15:18,333 --> 01:15:20,500
Today is not my day

1207
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:21,583
Ghost?!

1208
01:15:21,917 --> 01:15:23,125
Run!

1209
01:15:39,792 --> 01:15:40,792
Ghost!

1210
01:15:47,292 --> 01:15:49,458
You finally show up

1211
01:16:25,583 --> 01:16:26,792
You go to dead!

1212
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:42,625
Help...

1213
01:16:48,167 --> 01:16:49,292
Godfather!

1214
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:52,208
That's bad

1215
01:16:52,208 --> 01:16:54,875
How come you miss such a good time?

1216
01:16:54,875 --> 01:16:55,750
Godfather, I...

1217
01:16:55,750 --> 01:16:56,750
Don't waste time!

1218
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:57,375
Listen, before 12 o'clock

1219
01:16:57,375 --> 01:16:59,250
you should arrive Sacred Heart Hospital

1220
01:16:59,250 --> 01:17:01,833
Otherwise, the pregnant woman will be in danger

1221
01:17:01,833 --> 01:17:04,042
You too!

1222
01:17:12,375 --> 01:17:15,542
How did you feel?

1223
01:17:15,542 --> 01:17:16,792
Godfather...

1224
01:17:18,250 --> 01:17:21,125
I can't fly

1225
01:17:21,125 --> 01:17:23,083
Help me!

1226
01:17:23,250 --> 01:17:25,000
I can't help you any more

1227
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,333
I let this secret out, I broke the rule already

1228
01:17:27,333 --> 01:17:28,750
I have to look for a way yourself

1229
01:17:29,750 --> 01:17:32,125
Godfather...

1230
01:17:34,708 --> 01:17:36,333
What happen?

1231
01:17:37,375 --> 01:17:38,167
Before 12 o'clock,

1232
01:17:38,167 --> 01:17:40,208
I have to be at the Sacred Heart Hospital

1233
01:17:41,000 --> 01:17:43,208
if not I'll never reincarnate

1234
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:44,083
Don't be afraid!

1235
01:17:44,083 --> 01:17:46,000
We'll take you to the hospital

1236
01:17:49,750 --> 01:17:51,083
Hurry!

1237
01:17:52,667 --> 01:17:53,875
Help!

1238
01:17:54,458 --> 01:17:55,250
Excuse me

1239
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:57,708
Excuse me, please!

1240
01:18:22,792 --> 01:18:24,667
Only 7 minutes left, hurry up

1241
01:18:24,667 --> 01:18:26,333
I'm trying my best

1242
01:18:34,417 --> 01:18:35,375
What happens?

1243
01:18:35,375 --> 01:18:36,125
The car broke down

1244
01:18:36,125 --> 01:18:37,167
Try again

1245
01:18:37,167 --> 01:18:39,000
Hon Sir, look at her

1246
01:18:40,208 --> 01:18:41,583
What are we going to do?

1247
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:44,625
She's looking very bad?

1248
01:18:44,625 --> 01:18:45,250
Don't try again

1249
01:18:45,250 --> 01:18:46,583
I'll go and get a car

1250
01:18:49,792 --> 01:18:53,208
Taxi...

1251
01:18:55,708 --> 01:18:57,417
Can you go to Sacred Heart Hospital

1252
01:18:57,417 --> 01:18:58,583
within 7 minutes

1253
01:18:58,583 --> 01:18:59,500
Are you kidding?

1254
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:00,583
You want me speeding? No way

1255
01:19:00,583 --> 01:19:01,667
It'll take an hour at least

1256
01:19:01,667 --> 01:19:03,167
Get out then!

1257
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:04,000
Hands off!

1258
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,708
Get in. Hon Sir!

1259
01:19:05,875 --> 01:19:06,833
Drive as fast as you can

1260
01:19:06,833 --> 01:19:07,875
Steal my car!

1261
01:19:07,875 --> 01:19:10,292
Hurry up!

1262
01:19:10,708 --> 01:19:12,375
Why you steal my car?

1263
01:19:12,375 --> 01:19:14,708
Hon Sir, take a short cut

1264
01:19:17,792 --> 01:19:19,167
Police, they stole my car

1265
01:19:19,167 --> 01:19:20,667
We're borrowing your car only?

1266
01:19:20,667 --> 01:19:22,208
We are going to the hospital

1267
01:19:22,208 --> 01:19:22,958
That is my car

1268
01:19:22,958 --> 01:19:24,417
Borrow it to me, please?

1269
01:19:25,625 --> 01:19:28,292
Someone is stealing my car

1270
01:19:28,292 --> 01:19:29,917
That's your car?

1271
01:19:29,917 --> 01:19:31,750
The cap there?

1272
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:37,583
Chase after the cap

1273
01:19:37,583 --> 01:19:41,375
Driving at your fastest speed

1274
01:19:45,375 --> 01:19:46,417
Get out of my way

1275
01:19:46,417 --> 01:19:48,542
Don't be stupid

1276
01:20:26,667 --> 01:20:28,125
How did you drive?

1277
01:20:29,333 --> 01:20:30,458
Lucky, I have seat belt on

1278
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:31,833
This belt very good

1279
01:20:31,833 --> 01:20:32,542
Behind the car

1280
01:20:32,542 --> 01:20:34,208
Help me get rid of this damn belt

1281
01:20:34,208 --> 01:20:35,417
Hurry up!

1282
01:20:37,708 --> 01:20:40,250
Don't run!

1283
01:20:40,625 --> 01:20:41,750
You!

1284
01:20:42,125 --> 01:20:43,458
Get down!

1285
01:20:49,958 --> 01:20:52,125
You, get down!

1286
01:20:53,750 --> 01:20:55,458
Don't run!...

1287
01:20:59,042 --> 01:21:00,208
Don't hit!...

1288
01:21:01,583 --> 01:21:02,792
Bastard!

1289
01:21:06,625 --> 01:21:08,792
Go after him!...

1290
01:21:16,542 --> 01:21:18,625
You'll be alright? Hubby!

1291
01:21:18,625 --> 01:21:20,208
Will be OK

1292
01:21:26,292 --> 01:21:28,125
Go away!...

1293
01:21:28,333 --> 01:21:29,583
Up!

1294
01:21:31,583 --> 01:21:32,958
What do you want?

1295
01:21:38,958 --> 01:21:42,000
Crazy!

1296
01:21:42,917 --> 01:21:43,792
Attention

1297
01:21:43,792 --> 01:21:44,333
We found a dangerous,

1298
01:21:44,333 --> 01:21:46,292
mad man

1299
01:21:46,292 --> 01:21:48,500
Stole a cap no CC328

1300
01:21:48,500 --> 01:21:49,833
driving toward south east direction

1301
01:21:49,833 --> 01:21:51,208
If anyone finds him,

1302
01:21:51,208 --> 01:21:52,875
catch him and report to the police

1303
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:31,375
This is it, arrest them

1304
01:22:39,125 --> 01:22:40,583
Be careful...

1305
01:22:56,958 --> 01:22:58,583
What happens to your hands

1306
01:23:00,583 --> 01:23:02,875
When all my skin colour fades out

1307
01:23:03,417 --> 01:23:06,000
I will vanish forever

1308
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,417
People in the car,

1309
01:23:08,417 --> 01:23:10,750
get out and surrender!

1310
01:23:15,375 --> 01:23:16,792
Beware, the car is coming backward

1311
01:23:38,375 --> 01:23:41,167
If I don't help you,
you'll get into real trouble

1312
01:23:41,167 --> 01:23:42,417
It is my previous spirit, Happy Ghost!

1313
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:44,125
After I change to this new hair style,

1314
01:23:44,125 --> 01:23:46,083
my super power is stronger!

1315
01:23:48,625 --> 01:23:49,750
Turn!

1316
01:23:58,333 --> 01:24:01,750
My eyes really have problem, honey

1317
01:24:02,333 --> 01:24:03,667
Driving license please

1318
01:24:03,833 --> 01:24:05,375
Please give me a chance, Sir!

1319
01:24:15,875 --> 01:24:17,833
Why do you give me a ticket,

1320
01:24:17,833 --> 01:24:19,250
not to him

1321
01:24:22,667 --> 01:24:24,208
Terrific, I can't believe it

1322
01:24:45,333 --> 01:24:46,708
We only have 2 more minutes left

1323
01:24:46,708 --> 01:24:48,292
Take a short cut

1324
01:24:53,167 --> 01:24:54,083
Flying up?

1325
01:24:54,083 --> 01:24:55,417
No, we go under the ground

1326
01:25:05,875 --> 01:25:08,417
If you can't have the baby out
you need an operation

1327
01:25:09,167 --> 01:25:10,583
No...

1328
01:25:10,583 --> 01:25:12,958
I'll have a scar

1329
01:25:12,958 --> 01:25:15,375
Your tummy will not only scar but mince

1330
01:25:26,958 --> 01:25:28,042
One more minute left

1331
01:25:28,042 --> 01:25:29,333
Take her to reincarnate now

1332
01:25:29,333 --> 01:25:30,625
Thanks!

1333
01:25:34,542 --> 01:25:35,750
Thanks!

1334
01:25:40,250 --> 01:25:41,958
What is that man doing?

1335
01:25:44,125 --> 01:25:45,833
Excuse me!

1336
01:25:45,833 --> 01:25:47,333
What room number to you are looking for?

1337
01:25:49,333 --> 01:25:50,750
Please, excuse me

1338
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:51,667
Go to hell!

1339
01:25:51,667 --> 01:25:53,458
Not hell but reincarnation

1340
01:26:01,083 --> 01:26:04,583
Thanks, Ah Kwai!

1341
01:26:04,833 --> 01:26:06,417
Not at all

1342
01:26:06,417 --> 01:26:09,833
Because of me, you gave up a lot

1343
01:26:10,167 --> 01:26:13,542
Don't mention it, like what you told me

1344
01:26:13,542 --> 01:26:14,917
One's success

1345
01:26:14,917 --> 01:26:17,833
is depending on one's own effort

1346
01:26:19,167 --> 01:26:22,500
I have to go. Take care!

1347
01:26:32,167 --> 01:26:36,292
Wait for me

1348
01:26:36,750 --> 01:26:39,333
After 18 years, I'll marry you

1349
01:26:39,333 --> 01:26:40,417
Bye!

1350
01:26:54,625 --> 01:26:56,042
Here is Han. She is borne

1351
01:26:59,083 --> 01:27:01,208
My wife got a baby boy or girl?

1352
01:27:01,208 --> 01:27:02,667
A baby girl, good

1353
01:27:02,750 --> 01:27:03,583
Congratulation, Mr Koo!

1354
01:27:03,583 --> 01:27:05,042
You've got a baby girl

1355
01:27:06,875 --> 01:27:08,417
It's true, Han

1356
01:27:09,042 --> 01:27:10,708
It's really Han

1357
01:27:12,083 --> 01:27:12,833
Han!

1358
01:27:12,833 --> 01:27:14,458
That maniac

1359
01:27:14,792 --> 01:27:16,333
I will wait for you, Han

1360
01:27:16,333 --> 01:27:18,625
Are you crazy?

1361
01:27:18,625 --> 01:27:19,833
He is absolutely out of his mind

1362
01:27:19,833 --> 01:27:21,333
Take him to Castle Peak

1363
01:27:24,583 --> 01:27:27,167
Take him to Castle Peak

1364
01:27:27,208 --> 01:27:29,167
I'll marry your daughter

1365
01:27:29,167 --> 01:27:31,083
Father-in-law!
