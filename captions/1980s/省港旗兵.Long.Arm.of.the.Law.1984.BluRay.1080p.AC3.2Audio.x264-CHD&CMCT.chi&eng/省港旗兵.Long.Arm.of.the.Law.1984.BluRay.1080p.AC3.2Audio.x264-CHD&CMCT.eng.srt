1
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,029
Bull's Eye, up!

2
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,958
Throw them down

3
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,550
Here's for you

4
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,313
- Bull's Eye
- Tung

5
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,033
We've been waiting anxiously.

6
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,911
- Ah Pan
- Tung

7
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,399
Tung, Tung!

8
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,992
Tung's bringing us luck

9
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,755
Tung lights up our lives

10
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:19,194
Got something for everyone, one each

11
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,268
- Famous brand
- Right

12
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:31,475
What a difference this time

13
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,708
Chubby, Dupont,

14
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,429
expensive even in HK

15
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:40,710
It's yours

16
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,753
- Let me, granny
- Alright

17
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,433
Granny, these abalone are for you from Tung

18
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,714
- Thank you.
- How are you, granny?

19
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:55,748
Thanks, granny's too old now, no teeth

20
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,751
You can still eat them

21
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,790
Operation date on Dec. 1 9,

22
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,038
one month from now

23
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,478
The trip will take one full day

24
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,028
Why that day?

25
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,796
The 20th is Buddha's Day

26
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,675
It's be easier to get pass the road block

27
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,234
Have you planned the mountain route yet?

28
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,231
Yes I have We'll get on the train off

29
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,391
White-Cloud Hotel

30
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,116
We'll get to Shung Kong by nine

31
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,988
We'll get off at Shung Kong

32
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,392
Cross the hill to Shen Zhen, and the border

33
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:38,512
The trip will take 5 hours

34
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,954
We'll get to the border

35
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,632
before dawn

36
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,675
Alright

37
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,316
I'll be at the Wah Lai Hotel

38
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,670
on the 20th

39
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,358
Call me as soon as you cross the border

40
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,958
Here's the phone number and address

41
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,512
If we succeed

42
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:05,029
Each share worths HK$250,000

43
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:08,517
Enough for a life time

44
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,795
HK$100 for $28 our money

45
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:15,230
We're making $50 per month,

46
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:17,790
plus overtime

47
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,036
At this rate

48
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,396
It'll take us 100 years

49
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:25,194
to make this sum

50
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:32,519
No wonder they all go to Hong Kong

51
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,513
And then come back

52
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,556
Ioaded with money

53
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,390
Right,

54
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,712
and lots of jewelry

55
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,675
Golden necklace this thick

56
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,389
You must be mentally prepared

57
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,195
We need all of our experience

58
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,992
Every skill we'd learnt

59
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,357
in our army days

60
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,352
48 hours return trip

61
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,675
When we get back

62
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,075
we'll retire for good

63
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,719
48 hours, that's two days

64
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,234
No time for massage parlour

65
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,596
Right,

66
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:09,672
not even time for shopping

67
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,356
My wife won't like it.

68
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,029
Time is precious for security reason

69
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,358
We're going to make money, not to spend it

70
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,951
Anyone disagree

71
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,678
Then the operation is cancelled

72
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,757
We'll follow Tung's instructions,

73
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,553
of course

74
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,839
One for all

75
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,355
All for one

76
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,954
Great, one for all

77
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,952
All for one

78
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:06,998
"That's Eagle Bay, rough water"

79
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:15,638
"So what? "

80
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:24,358
"A stream separates two worlds"

81
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:32,195
"We'll cross it alright"

82
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:40,518
One for all, all for one

83
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,995
Cheers...

84
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:57,679
May the gods bless them all

85
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:02,231
Especially Chubby

86
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:05,836
Bless for his return, with money

87
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,873
Blockhead

88
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,589
Go home,

89
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,319
no need to see me off

90
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,478
OK, don't cry now, baby

91
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,830
I'll bring you

92
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,875
a toy gun

93
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,632
Don't forget

94
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,109
the shopping list

95
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,678
Send some money when you're there

96
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:42,351
Don't cry now

97
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,510
Don't get the wrong things

98
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,714
OK

99
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:47,791
No time for shopping anyway

100
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,268
Take him back

101
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:54,592
Wide-rim sun glasses

102
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:57,350
Something fashionable

103
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,078
Alright,

104
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,159
I'll bring back the shop

105
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,676
Don't cry

106
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,592
I won't forget a thing

107
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,712
Be good,

108
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,640
think of us

109
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,595
I know those Hong Kong girls

110
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,838
Keep your hands off them

111
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:26,553
OK, this is no funeral

112
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,109
- Go, go!
- Let's go

113
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,754
Stop complaining

114
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:47,990
The wire net

115
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:51,751
Rooster, seen any Big Cats?

116
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,553
Yeah, Big Cats

117
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,753
Soldiers, Bull's Eye!

118
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:23,878
Don't shoot. Run for it

119
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,994
Freeze, don't run

120
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:29,556
Stop, or I'll shoot

121
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,030
Damn it, do you hear, stop

122
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,837
Stop, we're going to shoot

123
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:35,989
You won't make it

124
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,151
Send in the dogs

125
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,519
It hurts

126
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:25,671
Bull's Eye!

127
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,112
Run for it, before it's too late

128
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,914
help me, help me!

129
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:40,629
help, help me

130
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,310
What are you to?

131
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,709
Keep quiet! We're not thieves

132
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,233
Can I use your phone

133
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:20,591
Please, keep those dogs quiet

134
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,912
Hello, yes, no, no such person

135
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,116
Asking for Ho?

136
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,551
Why didn't you say so

137
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,511
This is no Grand Hotel

138
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,676
Hello, Chubby, how's it going?

139
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,150
Where are you now?

140
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,875
Sorry, Tung,

141
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,473
couldn't pull Bull's Eye off

142
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,231
Tough luck,

143
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:58,912
first he hurt his leg

144
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,433
I knew it's not his day

145
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,837
He should've

146
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:04,955
prayed to the gods

147
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,553
His own fault

148
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,790
Don't cry,

149
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,434
go change

150
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,715
Thanks a lot, old man

151
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,199
Here's something for you

152
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,555
This is illegal

153
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,553
Just leave quick

154
00:16:43,640 --> 00:16:45,039
Cops, the drums

155
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,198
Stop, stop

156
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,192
License please

157
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,839
You clowns,

158
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,068
where's the circus

159
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:28,672
Why not the

160
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,758
whole orchestra

161
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,793
Shut up...ID Card

163
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,708
Who's asking you?

164
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,074
Sir

165
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,038
It's Buddha's birthday today

166
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,314
Who cares,

167
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:08,639
that's no excuse

168
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,914
We'll keep it down

169
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,518
Got a license

170
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,509
for the Birthday party?

171
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,752
I can arrest you all

172
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,150
Whose ID card?

173
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,037
Mine, sir, thanks

174
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,678
Fatty, from here on

175
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:39,071
No more drum beating, right?

176
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:40,069
Right

177
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,869
- Move, quick
- Thank you

178
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,875

195
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,233
It's up to you

196
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,317
to call

197
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:06,957
We'll have two hours to shop

198
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,995
We'll be on board by 1 :30

199
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,239
With the money

200
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,637
What do you think, Chubby?

201
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:16,950
Alright

202
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:20,632
Take a rest now

203
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,634
We'll go through the plan late

204
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,195
Taking us out

205
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,555
tonight, Tung

206
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:33,232
Remember our rules, Rooster?

207
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,199
Why's it closed, Chubby?

208
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,994
Damn, Indian trooper

209
00:21:46,560 --> 00:21:48,152
Security guard

210
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,151
That's reserved unit

211
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,596
Get lost, open up

212
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,309
Shut up

213
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:24,548
Sorry, sir

214
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,638
First job, right?

215
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,959
Yes,

216
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,837
I've been out for a week

217
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,193
Who're your partners

218
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,588
I'm alone,

219
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:38,388
can't you tell

220
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,636
Go ask

221
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,915
your inspector

222
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,957
He knows me well

223
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,272
Stop the fancy stuff

224
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,634
2369, something's funny with that car

225
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,550
Send in some guys

226
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:07,197
Yes, Sir

227
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,352
Darkie, follow me

228
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,829
This way, follow me

229
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:45,034
They're armed

230
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,231
Get in, get in!

231
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:48,035
Where's Blockhead?

232
00:24:48,040 --> 00:24:51,077
Where's he?

233
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,159
Forget it, get going

234
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:57,639
Where's Blockhead?

235
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:29,518
Everything's falling apart

236
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,349
The money

237
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,794
was right there

238
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:42,229
Forget,

239
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,435
we're better off than Bull's Eye

240
00:26:46,160 --> 00:26:53,589
You stupid, Blockhead

241
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:57,310
Who do you think you are?

242
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,154
Well...you don't agree?

243
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,909
You're a blacksheep

244
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,918
You're jinx

245
00:27:03,920 --> 00:27:05,148
What do you want, bugger?

246
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,590
What? For real?

247
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:07,555
Come on!

248
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,750
Bull's Eye's on my side

249
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,434
You creep, Bull's Eye

250
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,637
How do you feel, Chubby?

251
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,239
Lucky to be alive

252
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:35,393
We're all here. That's what counts

253
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,514
We've been through fire and rain

254
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,353
We're still with you

255
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,158
We'll act according to plan

256
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:48,919
Their security will loosen up

257
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,312
After the action this morning

258
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:54,511
We'll give them an encore

259
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,913
We'll operate in three days

260
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,152
We'll act in unison from now

261
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,317
All for one, right?

262
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,271
Every cloud has a silver lining

263
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,835
So we have three days

264
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,071
Time to relax with some girls

265
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:22,790
I've heard of

266
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:23,869
the massage parlours here

267
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,678
Must give a try

268
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:28,672
Lovely girls they have

269
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,557
Roosters, don't start up again

270
00:28:30,560 --> 00:28:31,629
Start up what?

271
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:32,311
Can't stand

272
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,675
another day like this

273
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:38,070
What's most precious, Blockhead?

274
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,435
Freedom

275
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:41,351
Right, freedom

276
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,715
You must get some

277
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,597
freedom for us

278
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,439
I'll back you up

279
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:56,236
I've been thinking

280
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,715
What we need is to relax

281
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,275
Right, Roosters?

282
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:03,033
Do you mean it?

283
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,600
Chung, go see Ah Sheung

284
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:07,710
Let's go out together tonight

285
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:08,830
Terrific

286
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,636
Tung

287
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,353
Please wait, we're working

288
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:25,270
Take a seat

289
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:36,997
998, Ah Lam

290
00:30:44,360 --> 00:30:46,669
Shameless

291
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:06,959
Tai, this is Tung

292
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,708
You're at the Crimson Kid?

293
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,076
I'll be right there

294
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,637
Tell me when I'm there

295
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,235
Ah Sheung

296
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,036
I'm here first, who's in charge

297
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,917
Stop arguing, take your turn

298
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,634
Who's first, desert rat?

299
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,679
- Ah Sheung
- Tung

300
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,754
- Chung
- Ah Sheung

301
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,037
You've changed so much

302
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,759
You've gained weight

303
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,678
You said you worked at a night club

304
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,720
Yes, at night

305
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,555
I share this place with Lulu daytime

306
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:08,232
I've bought

307
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:10,390
your favorite food

308
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,868
- Stay for dinner
- Alright

309
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:07,476
Bring in some pops, Monkey

310
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,832
Took you so long to call

311
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:17,352
I'm with someone, call you later

312
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,310
Well, that's life

313
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:24,875
Thanks

314
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,156
Where's the goods?

315
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,993
Some unexpected thing happened

316
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,551
Should've called me earlier

317
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,279
I'm telling you now

318
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,193
We postpone for 2 days

319
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,916
Tung,

320
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,868
I'm only the middle man

321
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:47,996
I've promised to deliver tonight

322
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,070
Forget it then

323
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,993
Easy, let's talk about it

324
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,035
Pops, boss

325
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:57,999
- Where's Dong?
- At the sauna

326
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,077
Call him back

327
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:03,358
He took in this forged $1,000 bill

328
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:06,315
He's going to take in anything

329
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:10,394
Dong said needed an Ultra-violet light

330
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:12,870
That's what he thinks

331
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:14,918
I can tell by just looking,

332
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,876
so should he

333
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,429
Next time

334
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,479
he'll swallow it

335
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,712
- Understand?
- Understand

336
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:29,394
- Boss
- Out

337
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,238
Tung, have a drink

338
00:34:32,680 --> 00:34:37,231
See, these rookies are worthless

339
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,313
I haven't lost weight on them though

340
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,996
You said in two days, eh?

341
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:48,754
That's fine with me

342
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,879
But, my buddies need bread

343
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,072
Advance some money to me first

344
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,755
Alright, boss?

345
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:09,999
We're all

346
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,909
brothers

347
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:16,317
We're from different clans

348
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,593
But we're brothers nevertheless

349
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:22,755
Share and share all, how much?

350
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,913
$30,000 for deposit

351
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:28,754
Let's do it this way

352
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,549
I've a problem,

353
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,148
can you help?

354
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:33,910
What about?

355
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:35,949
This guy sold me out

356
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,269
several times

357
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:43,072
You can have the $30,000,

358
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:45,198
extra

359
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,158
Just finish this guy off

360
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,835
What's his background

361
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:55,274
He is public enemy

362
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,879
You're doing everyone a favor

363
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:59,954
A big favor for me

364
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:02,310
OK

365
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:07,678
I'll do it for $50,000

366
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,674
Now you're talking

367
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,591
Welcome, Merry X'mas

368
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,272
Welcome, sirs

369
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:32,032
Come in, sirs

370
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,995
Indian Troopers again

371
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,754
The ladies are here

372
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,716
This is Jo Jo, sit down

373
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:23,436
- This is Di Di
- Hi, boss

374
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,750
Why standing, sit down

375
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,155
Make yourself at home

376
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:32,875
Please sit down

377
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,513
Sorry,

378
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,511
your lady is with another guest

379
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,437
She'll be here in a while

380
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,836
This is Joel, enjoy yourselves

381
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:56,316
Why so quiet?

382
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,518
You stood me up last time

383
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,075
Something came up

384
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,873
Why didn't you call?

385
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:05,873
You knew I worked here

386
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,229
You're hooked on me

387
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:13,270
Yes, with a hanger

388
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,319
Joel, telephone

389
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,599
Sorry

390
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,272
Helen is here

391
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:44,116
Vow, sharp looking chick

392
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:47,237
This is Ah Sheung, stupid

393
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,833
- Ah Sheung?
- Rooster

394
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:54,436
Ah Sheung? You're like a princess

395
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:55,475
Ah Sheung?

396
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,716
Chubby

397
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,517
I'm bored, let's dance

398
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,353
Where're you going?

399
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,952
Can you dance?

400
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:15,154
Drink

401
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,916
Have to pee. Coming?

402
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,555
OK, all for one

403
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,708
Luxurious

404
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:40,676
- More so then our Eastern Hotel
- Sure thing

405
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:45,519
Thanks

406
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,954
Have to pay to pee

407
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,079
How much then?

408
00:39:57,480 --> 00:40:00,950
$5 to pee, $10 to shit

409
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,994
$10 for two, right?

410
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,628
Thanks, care to wash up?

411
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:16,112
See, I've told you

412
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:38,394
Here you are

413
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,155
Well, good night

414
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,991
Go ahead

415
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,837
So grand,

416
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:55,355
very proper for your class

417
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:01,789
- Have to pee first
- Corny

418
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,158
Let me rub you back

419
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,150
I'll be on TVB's

420
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:53,115
Sing Sing Sing

421
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,158
Here a preview for you

422
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:59,559
Great, terrific

423
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,950
I haven't started yet

424
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:06,558
It hurts

425
00:42:06,840 --> 00:42:08,432
I'll sing now

426
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:12,596
"Let happiness graces upon me"

427
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:16,516
"It's joyful to be with you"

428
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:20,396
"I beg you to let me go"

429
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,838
"Cause there's no future for us"

430
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,956
"No future for us"

431
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:36,158
"You're like a rat pack"

432
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,829
I'm a respectable lady

433
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,195
Everybody else does it

434
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:42,628
I'm different,

435
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,633
I'm no whore

436
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,671
I have a very

437
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,671
good reputation

438
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,548
My customers

439
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,956
know my rules

440
00:42:56,400 --> 00:42:59,312
But you have agreed to come to watch TV

441
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,309
Right, let's watch TV

442
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:05,153
Stay naked and watch TV, that's your choice

443
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,149
I'd paid

444
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,993
for your time

445
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:13,996
How much, a hundred thousand

446
00:43:14,240 --> 00:43:17,630
I'm not in the mood

447
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:19,592
What am I to do

448
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,672
Watch TV then I'll leave first

449
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:24,955
A mahjong game is waiting

450
00:43:29,720 --> 00:43:31,597
God damn it

451
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:34,160
I don't have all night

452
00:43:38,560 --> 00:43:40,551
Time flies

453
00:43:41,280 --> 00:43:43,271
Now you lead a fast life

454
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,750
Remember when we were back home

455
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,918
We lived like dogs

456
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:54,911
I was good at nothing

457
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:58,710
You helped me a lot

458
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:01,589
Sheung, I'll be rich in a few days

459
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,719
I can't read your mind

460
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,831
If you still feel for me

461
00:44:07,640 --> 00:44:09,710
Then go back with me

462
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,593
Back home?

463
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:16,592
I'll have a lot of money soon

464
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:21,036
We'll buy a house and get married

465
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:23,756
Goodbye poverty then

466
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:27,874
What's up?

467
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:31,559
Tomorrow? What time?

468
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:35,908
Six-thirty

469
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:37,357
Alright

470
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:41,039
Tai Koo City, alright

471
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,432
Telephone for you, Fatso

472
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,553
Telephone, Fatso

473
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,231
Who is it?

474
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,798
It's me, Tai

475
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:02,870
Tai?

476
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,800
What is it this time?

477
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:08,830
Good stuff, coming?

478
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,835
- Where?
- Tai Koo City

479
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,952
Tai Koo City is a huge place

480
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:17,431
Shopping Centre

481
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:19,432
I'll be there after supper

482
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,559
Stop it, Fatso

483
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:39,073
- Bye, sweetie
- Bye

484
00:45:55,360 --> 00:45:57,749
- Are they here yet?
- Over there

485
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,956
- Over there?
- Yes

486
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,995
- Go say hello
- Me?

487
00:46:04,080 --> 00:46:05,593
Of course, who else?

488
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:07,079
- Why me?
- Move

489
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:22,352
Tung, where're your buddies?

490
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:36,790
Three dollars

491
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:40,677
Sweet young thing

492
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:41,908
Here's the change

493
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,115
Go for drink after work?

494
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:47,636
I'll be busy

495
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:50,079
You're shorter

496
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:31,995
Fatso

497
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,554
You monkey, where's your boss?

498
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:38,474
My boss?

499
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:43,799
Ice-cream in the winter? Good for you

500
00:47:45,160 --> 00:47:46,798
- Where are you going?
- Fatso

501
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:26,431
- Hi, Charlie
- Robert, how's the case?

502
00:48:26,600 --> 00:48:27,635
They're working around the clock

503
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:28,789
This is Inspector Chan

504
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:29,995
Nothing yet?

505
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:31,275
Won't be long, sir

506
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,508
Those are the victim's family

507
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:40,716
We'll take care of everything

508
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,075
Tung

509
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,838
Take it easy. It's me, Switch Blade

510
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:38,798
The boss is in Macau

511
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:51,280
Please, stop

512
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:56,391
I'll call him down

513
00:49:56,720 --> 00:50:00,759
Boss, boss

514
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:01,829
What's up?

515
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:04,874
Tung is here

516
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:05,596
I'm in Macau, remember?

517
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,114
Tai, my buddies are all here

518
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:09,515
I've told them

519
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:10,839
if I couldn't find you.

520
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,750
I'll fold this place up

521
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,079
He has a gun, boss

522
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:14,638
Take it easy, don't get mad.

523
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:15,914
Listen,

524
00:50:16,360 --> 00:50:18,396
I'm pretty good with the gun

525
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:19,310
Come out fast

526
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:21,591
OK, I'll be right there

527
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:27,836
Mr Lam, sir

528
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:48,629
Tai

529
00:50:52,360 --> 00:50:54,749
Mr Lam, Mr Lok, what a coincidence?

530
00:50:55,120 --> 00:50:56,269
Our boss

531
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:59,956
invites you for tea

532
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,436
I'll go later, OK

533
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,717
Fatso was murdered

534
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,597
I've heard,

535
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:14,229
that's life

536
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:17,399
Our boss like to talk to you about it

537
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:20,200
You and Fatso were very close

538
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,838
But...

539
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:27,519
Move, or else the handcuffs...

540
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,800
Stop kidding around

541
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:33,796
- It's alright
- Move

542
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:52,159
How's the tea

543
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,311
Great stuff

544
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,515
Is Fatso's tea

545
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,840
That's his cup

546
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,399
Bot bad

547
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:07,233
When did you see him last?

548
00:52:07,240 --> 00:52:09,117
- Who?
- Fatso

549
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,238
A few weeks ago

550
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,715
You're his informer,

551
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,592
who wants him dead?

552
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:15,919
I don't know

553
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:19,040
You cops have a lot of enemies

554
00:52:20,040 --> 00:52:23,350
Just kidding, just kidding

555
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:25,637
You deal with the 'O' gang,

556
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,436
right?

557
00:52:26,760 --> 00:52:28,398
That was history

558
00:52:28,920 --> 00:52:30,592
Who killed Fatso?

559
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,077
I don't know, I only worked for him

560
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,714
I have nothing to tell you

561
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,316
We'll charge you

562
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:43,596
I'm no murderer. I've been helpful

563
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:44,749
Check the record

564
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:45,715
No need

565
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,955
Tai

566
00:52:48,960 --> 00:52:51,349
A murdered cop is something else

567
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:56,878
Lee, long time no see

568
00:53:07,040 --> 00:53:08,234
Homicide takes care

569
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:11,238
of all murder cases

570
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:12,994
An unsolved case

571
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:15,157
usually fades away

572
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:17,079
Sometimes it would be forgotten altogether

573
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:18,913
But a murdered cop

574
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:22,232
The whole police force is on the case

575
00:53:22,680 --> 00:53:24,398
Every cop involved

576
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:26,279
is trying extra hard

577
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,359
The case is to be solved

578
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,757
A year, 1 0 years,

579
00:53:33,360 --> 00:53:36,079
a life time may be

580
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,788
I've said enough

581
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,918
Co-operate with us,

582
00:53:41,160 --> 00:53:42,149
that's your only choice

583
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:44,909
Tell me, who killed Fatso?

584
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:49,992
I swear to the gods,

585
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:53,558
Fatso and I were brothers

586
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,431
If he was sick, I felt the pain

587
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:04,999
I feel so bad now

588
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:09,189
This is no funeral home,

589
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,633
stop it

590
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:13,235
Here's the 'O' gang file,

591
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:14,759
pick them out

592
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:23,192
Unfamiliar faces,

593
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,549
can't recognize anyone

594
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,992
Listen loud and clear

595
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,953
Tell us or your business is done with

596
00:54:33,960 --> 00:54:35,234
We'll wipe out your gang in a month

597
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:39,192
This is only guess work

598
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:41,679
Contact us daily

599
00:54:42,040 --> 00:54:43,792
Brief us the latest news

600
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:44,517
For sure, for sure

601
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,396
More,

602
00:54:45,840 --> 00:54:49,037
there are $200,000 award money

603
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,316
That,

604
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,193
plus your own savings

605
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,719
Will feed you for life

606
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:56,876
Money doesn't mean a thing

607
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:57,949
Now get out

608
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:00,878
See you, gentlemen

609
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,717
- Follow him
- Yes, sir

610
00:55:10,080 --> 00:55:12,799
If I guess right,

611
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,276
these are the ones

612
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:15,476
Yes, sir

613
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:09,873
The sale is slow

614
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,115
What sale?

615
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:14,078
Used cars, gloomy

616
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:16,995
Yes, gloomy

617
00:56:18,680 --> 00:56:21,797
Your gun, sir, is sticking out

618
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:33,309
Beat you up

619
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:09,600
No, please, don't

620
00:57:09,840 --> 00:57:11,558
Don't

621
00:57:32,040 --> 00:57:34,429
Let me tell you why you have to die

622
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:36,591
You opportunist

623
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,199
You cheated us to kill the cop

624
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:41,998
And you sold us out to the police

625
00:57:42,280 --> 00:57:45,238
We only live once

626
00:57:45,240 --> 00:57:47,117
Tung, I didn't say anything

627
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,910
Don't, I didn't say anything

628
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,515
No difference. I'll take that you did

629
00:58:10,040 --> 00:58:12,315
Stop, please don't

630
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,040
Tung, stop!

631
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,278
Help...

632
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,515
We are old friends

633
00:58:32,840 --> 00:58:34,910
Don't, I kept my mouth shut

634
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:19,399
We won't put out the next one

635
00:59:19,920 --> 00:59:22,115
What did you say to the cops?

636
00:59:23,920 --> 00:59:25,353
Stop crying

637
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:29,230
Shut up

638
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,157
My mistake

639
00:59:36,560 --> 00:59:40,997
I was wrong

640
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,036
to think so high of you

641
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:47,229
I wanted you

642
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:48,959
to join me

643
00:59:49,120 --> 00:59:52,669
Your guts and my brain, fine team we are

644
00:59:54,040 --> 00:59:59,114
I didn't talk

645
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,028
even under torture

646
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,194
So put on the fire now,

647
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:08,714
go ahead

648
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:24,510
I believe in money only

649
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,838
Take with you $1,500,000 tomorrow

650
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:30,600
To the Tsuen Wan Bus terminal

651
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:34,117
Come alone or don't come at all

652
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:38,149
And we'll get you sooner or later

653
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:39,468
We're partners,

654
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:41,159
what's the problem

655
01:00:41,680 --> 01:00:44,035
The problem is yours

656
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,229
Everyone is against us

657
01:00:50,560 --> 01:00:52,869
Soon we'll be out in the cold

658
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:54,953
The situation is clear

659
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,112
Time for action

660
01:00:57,400 --> 01:00:59,436
We must attack

661
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:03,396
Remember the Grand Hotel case

662
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:06,710
The 3 of us over that rat pack

663
01:01:07,120 --> 01:01:11,238
They would shake all over just to have my name

664
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:11,877
We'll get them tomorrow

665
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:13,393
when they deliver

666
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,036
Terrific

667
01:01:17,080 --> 01:01:19,548
Get some guns

668
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:22,349
from the Vietnam gang

669
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:25,718
Well...now?

670
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:30,272
Not tomorrow, not next year, now!

671
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,791
It's not that simple

672
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:37,909
I'll manage with a week or two

673
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,874
That's more reasonable

674
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,993
Pay cash, money gets you anything

675
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:47,356
Say, how much?

676
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:51,755
Right, money can buy anything

677
01:01:52,160 --> 01:01:54,674
But then

678
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:57,672
We're going to lose...

679
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:00,592
I mean they have nothing to lose

680
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:03,600
It doesn't worth it

681
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,831
But we got pushed

682
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:09,351
against the wall

683
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:11,955
You all talk big,

684
01:02:12,280 --> 01:02:15,556
now's time to prove it

685
01:02:16,040 --> 01:02:20,079
Switch Blade, tell it to them

686
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:24,870
Tai is our boss, we're his gang

687
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:29,558
We're here

688
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:31,478
to serve him as always

689
01:02:31,920 --> 01:02:35,196
But I suggest to stay cool this time

690
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:39,679
Those guys are beasts

691
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:41,433
We've our

692
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,638
families here

693
01:02:45,040 --> 01:02:47,952
We must think for them

694
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:49,235
Right?

695
01:02:54,040 --> 01:02:56,270
Boss, stay cool please

696
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:59,189
Can't we stay up for a while?

697
01:02:59,640 --> 01:03:06,034
Or take a hike

698
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:07,515
to buy time

699
01:03:17,280 --> 01:03:18,838
It's only my second bowl

700
01:03:55,160 --> 01:04:00,234
We'll do as you say, fantastic

701
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:20,110
That's the New Year man,

702
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:24,477
come out at X'mas

703
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,716
It's Christmas

704
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:57,874
This is our

705
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:01,114
Iast day in Hong Kong.

706
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,830
Whatever undone

707
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:05,673
should be taken care of

708
01:05:06,120 --> 01:05:07,519
But don't stay up too late

709
01:05:08,360 --> 01:05:10,316
Let's go, all for one

710
01:05:10,760 --> 01:05:12,432
Satisfied, Rooster?

711
01:05:12,880 --> 01:05:15,030
What a guy

712
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,712
Move, move

713
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:28,119
And then?

714
01:05:28,200 --> 01:05:31,033
We'll stay up the night

715
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:46,230
Why didn't you

716
01:05:46,240 --> 01:05:47,992
come up

717
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,118
Just not in the mood

718
01:05:50,360 --> 01:05:51,839
You're always like this

719
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,394
How about your customers

720
01:05:53,480 --> 01:05:54,833
Bunch of bores

721
01:06:00,160 --> 01:06:02,071
Quit early tonight, go home.

722
01:06:02,680 --> 01:06:03,715
That much

723
01:06:03,960 --> 01:06:05,279
It's New Year

724
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:09,234
When will you be back?

725
01:06:10,480 --> 01:06:11,435
All a week,

726
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:12,875
I'll call you

727
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,110
- Don't tease me
- I won't

728
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:19,389
Bye

729
01:06:20,600 --> 01:06:23,239
Keep the stub, there's a lucky draw

730
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:27,439
First prize is a trip to Pattaya

731
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,670
All yours, I have no use of it

732
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:30,396
Really?

733
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,789
- I won't be here
- Really?

734
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:35,632
Where's Pattaya, Rooster?

735
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:39,469
Pattaya? Oh USA

736
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,758
USA

737
01:06:45,840 --> 01:06:48,479
Merry Christmas

738
01:06:48,880 --> 01:06:50,199
Merry Christmas

739
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:58,711
You really going tomorrow?

740
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:02,349
Why don't

741
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:04,393
you stay?

742
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,829
Come with me

743
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,390
May be you'll like it here

744
01:07:13,720 --> 01:07:14,948
I didn't like it

745
01:07:15,280 --> 01:07:18,477
here at first

746
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:22,999
I've grown accustom to it now

747
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,118
I'm my own

748
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:26,189
boss here

749
01:07:26,520 --> 01:07:28,590
May be you'll miss

750
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:30,114
this place too

751
01:07:33,920 --> 01:07:36,150
It's not a matter

752
01:07:36,560 --> 01:07:38,039
of wanting to stay or not

753
01:07:39,000 --> 01:07:40,558
If I get caught,

754
01:07:40,920 --> 01:07:42,194
everyone's in trouble

755
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:46,668
I must go

756
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:55,149
We shouldn't discuss it anymore

757
01:07:56,440 --> 01:07:57,919
There's no time

758
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:13,313
It's for you

759
01:08:25,960 --> 01:08:28,394
Buy yourself some goodies

760
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,799
Take good care of yourself

761
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:33,992
When are you coming back?

762
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,991
Difficult to say,

763
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,713
give me a kiss

764
01:08:57,560 --> 01:08:58,390
What are you doing?

765
01:08:58,800 --> 01:08:59,755
Be your lover

766
01:08:59,760 --> 01:09:02,320
You agreed to come out

767
01:09:02,320 --> 01:09:04,834
But not here, I don't like it

768
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:07,191
My friends have all made it

769
01:09:07,200 --> 01:09:10,112
And I'm here talking

770
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:14,473
I want to go dancing with you

771
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:18,428
And then go shopping

772
01:09:18,840 --> 01:09:21,308
I might not be back

773
01:09:22,160 --> 01:09:24,230
Alright, $10,000

774
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:25,229
$10,000?

775
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:26,839
What? Doesn't worth it?

776
01:09:27,040 --> 01:09:28,268
You, $10,000?

777
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:32,191
Or do you want to watch TV?

778
01:09:32,200 --> 01:09:35,431
There's a film on, from Taiwan

779
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,715
You haven't seen it for sure

780
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:45,591
I'll give you ten, where would you like it?

781
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:52,551
I'm no fancy guy I know

782
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:55,240
You took me as a fool

783
01:09:55,240 --> 01:09:58,118
But what are you, pumpkin

784
01:09:58,280 --> 01:09:59,633
Strip off, now

785
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:05,270
Quick

786
01:10:15,160 --> 01:10:16,513
Chewing gum

787
01:10:20,800 --> 01:10:21,869
Come here

788
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:37,749
Stay down

789
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:45,274
Don't, don't

790
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:41,917
I picked up

791
01:11:42,240 --> 01:11:44,754
this tape for $40,000

792
01:11:49,720 --> 01:11:51,472
This 'O' gang

793
01:11:51,960 --> 01:11:54,110
is too much

794
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:57,231
They are just dirt back home

795
01:12:09,640 --> 01:12:11,949
Enough evidence to go to court?

796
01:12:21,480 --> 01:12:24,233
Hong Kong

797
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:26,708
is something else

798
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:34,472
And...Tung

799
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:36,438
Can't we stay at all?

800
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:42,113
Now you too, Chubby?

801
01:12:42,440 --> 01:12:46,228
Just reflecting their view

802
01:12:47,520 --> 01:12:49,988
I don't understand

803
01:12:50,520 --> 01:12:52,317
in fact

804
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:56,311
They won't understand

805
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:58,359
Let me be honest with you

806
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:02,113
I'm one of the most

807
01:13:02,600 --> 01:13:03,794
wanted persons here

808
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:07,799
Now it's all on nothing

809
01:13:08,560 --> 01:13:10,630
With money I can hide out or a few years

810
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,193
That's why we all have to go back

811
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:17,112
Will you support me

812
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:23,149
All for one, one for all

813
01:13:24,720 --> 01:13:28,395
Just like old time,

814
01:13:28,920 --> 01:13:30,478
comrades

815
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:37,437
But we have the advantage this time

816
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:42,791
Goodbye, honey

817
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:44,508
Merry Christmas

818
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:45,948
One more kiss

819
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,399
What so funny?

820
01:14:01,240 --> 01:14:02,229
You are

821
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:16,312
Can't I help you?

822
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:54,516
Bring in the cheque

823
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:06,999
Anything you like

824
01:15:07,240 --> 01:15:08,355
A necklace

825
01:15:08,360 --> 01:15:10,237
For you girlfriend

826
01:15:10,600 --> 01:15:13,319
- No, my lover
- Pardon?

827
01:15:13,600 --> 01:15:16,831
No, for my wife. Those please

828
01:15:17,840 --> 01:15:18,750
This one?

829
01:15:23,800 --> 01:15:25,791
Some new ones over there

830
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:34,910
What's up?

831
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,032
It's a stick up. Don't move

832
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:40,350
It's a stick up, down

833
01:15:44,360 --> 01:15:46,078
It's a stick up...

834
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:49,038
Don't move, hands over heads

835
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:49,836
Want to die?

836
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:56,279
Don't watch, down...

837
01:15:56,280 --> 01:15:57,349
Don't scream!

838
01:15:57,360 --> 01:15:58,679
Don't shot...

839
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:04,230
Open up the safe, quick

840
01:16:21,720 --> 01:16:22,755
Don't look

841
01:16:28,120 --> 01:16:31,157
Down, stay down

842
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:37,035
Don't scream or want to die

843
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:44,435
Let's go, Blockhead

844
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:49,119
Not me, I didn't press it

845
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:58,877
Shit...out from back door

846
01:17:00,760 --> 01:17:03,194
Freeze, or I'll shoot

847
01:17:06,040 --> 01:17:07,029
Don't move

848
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:18,715
Don't away, wanna get shot?

849
01:17:20,360 --> 01:17:21,076
Split

850
01:17:21,600 --> 01:17:22,476
Let's split

851
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,992
Get going

852
01:17:26,680 --> 01:17:27,351
Get going...

853
01:17:27,360 --> 01:17:28,349
Don't chase!

854
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:30,592
Stay down

855
01:17:58,120 --> 01:18:00,839
Those guys called me just now, sir

856
01:18:01,240 --> 01:18:02,673
They want me back

857
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:04,671
at Crimson Kid

858
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:08,150
There's a leak on your side

859
01:18:09,120 --> 01:18:10,917
S.P. calling Steve, S.P. calling Steve

860
01:18:11,200 --> 01:18:12,076
Steve's here, sir

861
01:18:12,080 --> 01:18:14,355
Put a transmitter in Tai's car

862
01:18:14,560 --> 01:18:16,073
- And bring the car over
- Roger

863
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:18,152
We're putting a transmitter in your car

864
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:19,679
Keep in touch on your way

865
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:21,518
What transmitter?

866
01:18:21,680 --> 01:18:24,877
It's unreliable

867
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:26,672
I might lose contact

868
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:29,353
Trust us, go now

869
01:18:29,520 --> 01:18:32,671
Take care of me, sir

870
01:18:37,120 --> 01:18:38,553
Test, Test, over

871
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,553
1,2,3, do you read me

872
01:18:41,560 --> 01:18:42,151
Over

873
01:18:42,240 --> 01:18:44,549
Nice and clear, relax

874
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:46,028
State your position

875
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:48,872
Looks like Cornwall street

876
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:51,390
Right, I see the Baptist Hospital

877
01:18:59,120 --> 01:19:02,908
Tung, you're like a ghost

878
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:08,194
That's not funny

879
01:19:27,160 --> 01:19:28,832
Tung's car appeared

880
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,712
from nowhere, over

881
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,079
Do you read me, over

882
01:19:36,520 --> 01:19:39,114
I knew it. I knew it

883
01:19:40,280 --> 01:19:42,669
Over, Over...

884
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:54,594
I'm somewhere

885
01:19:54,600 --> 01:19:57,831
in Tiger Hill

886
01:20:11,560 --> 01:20:14,597
Nice job, eh!

887
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,673
Congratulations, Tung

888
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:39,433
I take it myself

889
01:20:41,680 --> 01:20:44,956
Right, how do we celebrate?

890
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:51,349
How about

891
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,591
the hot-pot

892
01:20:53,760 --> 01:20:55,955
I know a joint in Mongkok

893
01:20:56,120 --> 01:20:57,872
Tung, found this in his car

894
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:04,555
Micro-wave amplifier

895
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:06,113
Transmitter

896
01:21:06,720 --> 01:21:10,429
Look, aren't we buddies

897
01:21:10,960 --> 01:21:13,235
Don't frame me with this

898
01:21:13,240 --> 01:21:16,312
Where are you now Tai? Over

899
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:33,268
Please don't, Tung, Tung, I'm sorry, I so sorry

900
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:36,716
Please spare me

901
01:21:42,160 --> 01:21:43,752
AS calling HQ,

902
01:21:44,040 --> 01:21:45,473
Tiger Hill reservoir

903
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:47,039
Come in please, over

904
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:01,835
Listen you, you're surrounded

905
01:22:02,040 --> 01:22:05,669
Put down your weapons and surrender

906
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:08,677
Tung, they forced me

907
01:22:08,840 --> 01:22:10,717
to co-operate

908
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:12,674
No use to kill me

909
01:22:13,160 --> 01:22:15,594
Take me hostage,

910
01:22:15,760 --> 01:22:17,352
bargain with them

911
01:22:17,760 --> 01:22:19,671
Alright, talk with them

912
01:22:20,160 --> 01:22:23,516
You'll be the first to go

913
01:22:23,720 --> 01:22:24,675
Blockhead

914
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:28,357
No funny stuff

915
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:31,519
Don't shoot

916
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:34,434
Get in

917
01:22:34,640 --> 01:22:36,039
This is the last warning

918
01:22:37,040 --> 01:22:39,190
I'll count down

919
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:40,635
from 5

920
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,438
It's me Tai,

921
01:22:42,440 --> 01:22:44,829
I'm their hostage

922
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:47,349
Don't shoot

923
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:50,438
Do you hear?

924
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:57,478
-It's me, Tai
- 5, 4, 3, 2...

925
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,636
- Stop counting please.
-... 1!

926
01:22:59,920 --> 01:23:02,593
Stop it

927
01:23:02,600 --> 01:23:03,430
Fire

928
01:23:35,400 --> 01:23:37,118
Get away from the car

929
01:23:37,120 --> 01:23:38,951
Over here Blockhead

930
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:42,159
It's going to explode

931
01:24:04,760 --> 01:24:05,988
Hold on

932
01:24:16,240 --> 01:24:19,038
Blockhead can't make it, help him

933
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,034
Blockhead can't make it

934
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:28,238
Go there!

935
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:29,309
Go!

936
01:25:19,080 --> 01:25:19,910
Tung

937
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:21,758
Doctor Ngam, please help us

938
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:23,671
Come in, can't talk here

939
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:41,919
Tell them to go

940
01:25:42,440 --> 01:25:44,590
I can't

941
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:47,311
You've passed the written exams

942
01:25:47,840 --> 01:25:49,512
Oral exam is next week

943
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:53,079
They're going to ruin your hope

944
01:25:53,080 --> 01:25:55,071
And we have to go to jail

945
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:57,916
Think for yourself, old man

946
01:25:57,920 --> 01:25:59,273
He's passed out, doctor

947
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:01,191
Coming

948
01:26:01,200 --> 01:26:03,760
Go get some antibiotics

949
01:26:10,680 --> 01:26:11,556
What's your name

950
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:14,278
I can't tell you

951
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:18,197
Just tell her

952
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:21,910
A good friend called

953
01:26:22,160 --> 01:26:24,913
Phone number please

954
01:26:24,920 --> 01:26:31,155
Phone number? Area code 3

955
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:38,396
Hurry

956
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:47,309
Sorry, madam

957
01:27:15,560 --> 01:27:18,393
Is this 843907

958
01:27:18,480 --> 01:27:20,391
Ah Sheung, it's me

959
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,595
- Are you alright?
- Alright, we're alright

960
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:33,910
You're a genius, doc, all 3 are out.

961
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:38,118
Wait, there's one near the heart

962
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:40,518
Can't do it here

963
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:43,436
Has to go to a hospital

964
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:50,909
Sheung, we're not going

965
01:27:56,880 --> 01:27:59,075
- I've called
- What?

966
01:27:59,600 --> 01:28:01,955
I've called the police

967
01:28:03,040 --> 01:28:04,917
Can we talk, doctor

968
01:28:05,360 --> 01:28:06,429
Coming

969
01:28:09,880 --> 01:28:12,440
What's the odds doing it here?

970
01:28:13,320 --> 01:28:14,230
Impossible

971
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:16,391
You took the rest out

972
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:18,152
Not this one, not here

973
01:28:18,320 --> 01:28:20,754
It's right by the heart

974
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:23,429
We need blood, everything

975
01:28:23,720 --> 01:28:25,392
We'll kill him

976
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,678
doing it here

977
01:28:28,760 --> 01:28:30,910
It has to be a registered hospital?

978
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:35,471
No underground clinics to do it?

979
01:28:36,080 --> 01:28:36,796
None

980
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:38,515
Ah Sheung is coming over

981
01:28:38,760 --> 01:28:40,512
She has a

982
01:28:40,760 --> 01:28:42,193
surgeon customer

983
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:51,473
How are you, Blockhead?

984
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:56,075
Don't leave me

985
01:28:56,280 --> 01:28:59,078
We're not

986
01:28:59,240 --> 01:29:01,993
Ieaving

987
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:04,640
Send him to hospital please

988
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:07,076
Just say he bumped into here

989
01:29:11,720 --> 01:29:14,473
Take a rest, Blockhead

990
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:17,156
We'll send your share to your wife

991
01:29:17,640 --> 01:29:19,358
We trust you

992
01:29:19,640 --> 01:29:21,790
to keep quiet

993
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:27,274
No way, can't leave him alone

994
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:29,829
All for one, remember

995
01:29:31,440 --> 01:29:32,919
Chubby, what do you think?

996
01:29:36,200 --> 01:29:37,792
Chung

997
01:29:38,440 --> 01:29:41,113
I've told Ah Sheung. I would be staying

998
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:44,160
Right, we all agree

999
01:29:44,160 --> 01:29:46,469
It's up to you Tung,

1000
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:47,435
Iet's gamble

1001
01:29:47,440 --> 01:29:49,715
Or dump him into the ocean

1002
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:53,395
He's going

1003
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:54,635
to die

1004
01:29:54,640 --> 01:29:56,756
We're wasting time

1005
01:29:56,960 --> 01:29:59,428
We've told Chubby we would stay

1006
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,670
He'll die if we leave

1007
01:30:01,960 --> 01:30:04,633
Might as well shoot him now

1008
01:31:00,840 --> 01:31:01,955
Blockhead, Blockhead

1009
01:31:02,760 --> 01:31:03,636
How's he?

1010
01:31:10,440 --> 01:31:10,952
He's dead

1011
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:16,954
Bury him please, doctor

1012
01:31:19,160 --> 01:31:19,990
Take this

1013
01:31:34,120 --> 01:31:37,237
Mr. Lai, it's me, can't you tell?

1014
01:31:45,040 --> 01:31:47,634
Buddy, where's Old Man Street?

1015
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:50,911
- Straight ahead
- Thanks

1016
01:31:58,600 --> 01:32:01,319
Go home, keep off the street

1017
01:32:01,680 --> 01:32:05,559
Sorry, we're closing

1018
01:32:06,880 --> 01:32:08,950
Keep of the street, Miss

1019
01:32:09,240 --> 01:32:11,708
Stick back your heads

1020
01:32:23,680 --> 01:32:25,352
Everyone's familiar with the situation

1021
01:32:25,680 --> 01:32:26,351
Yes, sir

1022
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:27,316
One question, sir

1023
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:28,355
Yes, Mr Mchenzie

1024
01:32:28,440 --> 01:32:30,510
How much warning do we give those bastards?

1025
01:32:31,800 --> 01:32:33,631
How much fucking warning will they give you?

1026
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:41,239
Shut up...bad guy's coming

1027
01:32:43,480 --> 01:32:48,349
Should come to church more often

1028
01:32:48,600 --> 01:32:50,955
Look at our report

1029
01:32:51,200 --> 01:32:55,671
Had Wong Tai been sick lately?

1030
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:58,149
Headache? Arthritis?

1031
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:21,952
1236, found anything?

1032
01:33:24,440 --> 01:33:25,759
Stop running, buddy

1033
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:29,077
Stand still...you...

1034
01:35:31,320 --> 01:35:32,196
Quick!

1035
01:35:57,800 --> 01:35:58,789
Stay there

1036
01:36:09,440 --> 01:36:10,873
Don't move!

1037
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:15,318
-Stand up, don't come close
-Don't shot...

1038
01:36:15,320 --> 01:36:16,150
Don't kill him...

1039
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:18,836
Let's go!

1040
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:20,908
Bring him go too!

1041
01:36:21,360 --> 01:36:23,874
-Stand up, don't come close
-Don't let the guy go

1042
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:27,118
Don't shot...

1043
01:36:27,120 --> 01:36:30,271
Let him go, let him go

1044
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:43,439
Listen you over there

1045
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:46,520
This is the Police Special Squad No.3

1046
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:49,389
You are surrounded,

1047
01:36:49,600 --> 01:36:51,318
we're...

1048
01:36:56,760 --> 01:36:59,991
- Chung
-That way!

1049
01:37:08,600 --> 01:37:09,510
Go first!

1050
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:13,276
Don't come near...

1051
01:37:13,680 --> 01:37:15,511
Don't come close...

1052
01:37:15,760 --> 01:37:20,038
Don't you hear me. I'll kill him...

1053
01:37:22,360 --> 01:37:26,911
- Still come close
- Shot!

1054
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:44,150
Chung, Chung

1055
01:37:44,640 --> 01:37:45,629
Chung

1056
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:47,359
Ah Sheung

1057
01:37:58,000 --> 01:37:59,035
Get up

1058
01:38:04,680 --> 01:38:05,999
What's up, buddy?

1059
01:39:00,600 --> 01:39:02,431
- What's matter?
- Well

1060
01:39:05,800 --> 01:39:10,112
What are you doing?

1061
01:39:14,160 --> 01:39:17,436
It's full of cops outside

1062
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:26,790
I'm still young, I don't want to die

1063
01:39:27,360 --> 01:39:30,158
Chubby, let's surrender

1064
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:35,472
Tung, bargain with them

1065
01:39:36,360 --> 01:39:38,874
Is there a back door, doctor?

1066
01:39:39,080 --> 01:39:41,036
There's a trap door up there

1067
01:39:41,240 --> 01:39:43,470
Get on the roof, it leads to Junction Road

1068
01:39:43,480 --> 01:39:46,438
Why didn't you say so?

1069
01:40:12,600 --> 01:40:14,352
Wrong key

1070
01:40:14,360 --> 01:40:14,997
What key?

1071
01:40:15,240 --> 01:40:16,673
Key to this door

1072
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:17,556
Stop

1073
01:40:24,800 --> 01:40:25,789
What door?

1074
01:40:36,640 --> 01:40:38,551
It isn't me, it isn't me

1075
01:40:38,560 --> 01:40:40,596
You called the police

1076
01:40:52,480 --> 01:40:54,471
Coming out now. He's armed

1077
01:40:57,600 --> 01:41:00,353
Don't shoot, don't shoot

1078
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:02,949
I'm a doctor,

1079
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:05,589
not the 'O' gang

1080
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:10,790
Blow off the door

1081
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:26,275
Go

1082
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:52,195
Go

1083
01:41:57,880 --> 01:41:58,835
Fire!

1084
01:42:04,440 --> 01:42:07,716
Try bargain with them, Tung

1085
01:42:43,680 --> 01:42:48,435
Keep quiet
