00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:13,584
Behave yourself! Get away!

3
00:01:17,751 --> 00:01:19,751
Come have some watermelon

4
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:26,167
You are too polite.

5
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:28,292
You should come and eat with us!

6
00:01:28,917 --> 00:01:31,334
You're wat too kind. We've already eaten.

7
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:35,001
Where's Kuei-mei?

8
00:01:35,084 --> 00:01:36,917
Didn't you ask her to come?

9
00:01:37,001 --> 00:01:40,126
Get your auntie here.

10
00:01:40,209 --> 00:01:41,126
Tell her Momma Chai is here.

11
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:42,334
Mom asked you to go.

12
00:01:42,417 --> 00:01:43,501
Go on.
- Mom asked you to go.

13
00:01:43,584 --> 00:01:46,209
Hurry!

14
00:01:54,292 --> 00:01:55,876
Auntie, mom says Mrs. Chai is here

15
00:01:55,959 --> 00:01:57,376
She wants you to go.

16
00:01:57,459 --> 00:01:59,584
She wants to introduce a guy to you.

17
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:23,959
Don't run, you'll hurt yourself.

18
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:12,751
Mr. Hou, what is your Chinese Zodiac?

19
00:04:12,834 --> 00:04:13,501
Dragon.

20
00:04:13,584 --> 00:04:14,751
What about Kuei-mei?

21
00:04:14,834 --> 00:04:15,584
Kuei-mei is...

22
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:17,001
Here's Kuie-mei.

23
00:04:26,376 --> 00:04:28,251
Kuie-mei, come.

24
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:37,417
Mr. Hou, where is your hometown?

25
00:04:37,834 --> 00:04:41,292
Same as my husband, Nanking.

26
00:04:41,376 --> 00:04:42,667
Nanking!

27
00:04:42,751 --> 00:04:43,792
During the retreat...

28
00:04:43,876 --> 00:04:45,917
We stayed there for a while.

29
00:04:46,001 --> 00:04:47,501
It freezes you in winter.

30
00:04:47,584 --> 00:04:49,626
In summer, it's hotter than Taiwan.

31
00:04:49,709 --> 00:04:50,917
Yes... Yes...

32
00:04:51,001 --> 00:04:52,376
Have some tea.
- Thank you.

33
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,626
We've lived here for more than 7 years.

34
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:57,084
Well... in a glance...

35
00:04:57,167 --> 00:04:59,084
Who knows?

36
00:04:59,167 --> 00:05:01,334
We thought we were only staying
for a while...

37
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:02,876
That's right...

38
00:05:03,876 --> 00:05:04,751
Do you smoke?

39
00:05:04,834 --> 00:05:07,334
No...he doesn't smoke or drink.

40
00:05:07,917 --> 00:05:09,042
Good.

41
00:05:09,126 --> 00:05:10,792
They work in a restaurant.

42
00:05:10,876 --> 00:05:12,667
The manager is a foriegner

43
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:14,876
He doesn't allow them to smoke.

44
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:17,167
They can't even eat garlic.

45
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:17,917
Why not?

46
00:05:18,001 --> 00:05:19,917
The smell might chase customers away.

47
00:05:23,376 --> 00:05:24,917
What about mahjongg?

48
00:05:25,792 --> 00:05:27,167
Sometimes.

49
00:05:27,834 --> 00:05:29,209
They bet little

50
00:05:29,834 --> 00:05:32,001
It's fine to play a little.

51
00:05:32,084 --> 00:05:34,667
Don't play every day, like her.

52
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,792
Without Kuei-mei,

53
00:05:36,876 --> 00:05:38,917
there wouldn't be anybody to cook.

54
00:05:39,126 --> 00:05:40,459
Who plays everyday?

55
00:05:40,542 --> 00:05:42,084
Nonesense!

56
00:05:42,584 --> 00:05:45,417
Can Kui-mei play?

57
00:05:46,126 --> 00:05:47,501
No, she doesn't

58
00:05:47,584 --> 00:05:49,792
That's right! Our Kuie-mei...

59
00:05:49,876 --> 00:05:52,542
Doesn't have any bad habits.

60
00:05:52,626 --> 00:05:53,959
Unlike me.

61
00:05:54,042 --> 00:05:55,167
In his eyes

62
00:05:55,251 --> 00:05:56,917
I am good for nothing

63
00:05:57,001 --> 00:05:58,084
OK, OK.

64
00:05:58,167 --> 00:05:59,667
Don't make a fuss.

65
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:01,959
Kui-mei is really nice.

66
00:06:02,042 --> 00:06:04,251
She's busy all daylong.

67
00:06:04,334 --> 00:06:05,584
Of course.

68
00:06:42,584 --> 00:06:48,501
The island is like a boat,

69
00:06:48,584 --> 00:06:54,209
swinging in the moon light.

70
00:06:54,209 --> 00:06:56,750
My lady

71
00:06:56,751 --> 00:07:04,626
you also swing in my mind.

72
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:07,334
Let my voice

73
00:07:07,417 --> 00:07:10,126
pass with the wind.

74
00:07:10,209 --> 00:07:15,459
Open your curtain.

75
00:07:15,542 --> 00:07:18,167
Let my love

76
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:20,834
float with the river

77
00:07:20,917 --> 00:07:25,251
to you.

78
00:07:25,334 --> 00:07:26,084
Are you ok?

79
00:07:26,167 --> 00:07:27,209
Nothing.

80
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:28,376
Let me see.

81
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:47,792
There...that's better.

82
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:57,417
D you know about my family?

83
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:00,126
A little bit.

84
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:03,209
I have three kids

85
00:08:04,667 --> 00:08:07,584
Three wild kids

86
00:08:09,376 --> 00:08:10,417
How old are they?

87
00:08:10,501 --> 00:08:15,459
10, and 8. The yongest is 3.

88
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:19,584
It's windy here. Are you cold?

89
00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:40,251
Don't you know the time?

90
00:08:40,334 --> 00:08:42,751
You come home late
everytime you play cards.

91
00:08:42,834 --> 00:08:44,417
Leave me alone.

92
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:46,167
You gripe every time I play.

93
00:08:46,251 --> 00:08:47,001
Do you think you can control me

94
00:08:47,084 --> 00:08:48,542
because you support my living?

95
00:08:48,626 --> 00:08:49,626
Lower your voice

96
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:50,751
Who should I be afraid of?

97
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:53,542
You are the boss,
ofcourse you are afraid of no one

98
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:55,917
I don't want to

99
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:58,126
When did you ever want to?

100
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:04,209
Kuei-mei had a date today,
what did she say?

101
00:09:04,292 --> 00:09:07,084
I don't want her to marry a widower

102
00:09:07,626 --> 00:09:11,251
You don't want her to marry or you
want to keen her as a concubine?

103
00:09:11,334 --> 00:09:14,084
Your salary will keep her for a lifetime!

104
00:09:14,167 --> 00:09:15,584
You! Why do you talk like that?

105
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:16,751
How to say that

106
00:09:16,834 --> 00:09:18,709
When I don't know your mind

107
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:20,709
Last time you got 2 bottles of
Ponds from the PX.

108
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:23,209
You gave her one behind my back.

109
00:09:23,209 --> 00:09:24,375
You think I don't know.

110
00:09:24,376 --> 00:09:26,334
You...l don't want to talk with you

111
00:09:50,584 --> 00:09:54,084
Excuse me, where's
Hou Yung-Nien's home?

112
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:55,001
There.

113
00:09:55,084 --> 00:09:56,209
Thanks.

114
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:18,834
Kid, where's Hou Yungnien's home?

115
00:10:18,834 --> 00:10:21,333
There.

116
00:10:21,334 --> 00:10:22,292
Thanks.

117
00:10:31,751 --> 00:10:33,292
Anyone home?

118
00:10:45,251 --> 00:10:46,834
Dad, someone is looking for you.

119
00:10:46,917 --> 00:10:48,209
Who is it?

120
00:10:51,251 --> 00:10:53,126
Good kid.

121
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,542
Get out...

122
00:11:01,959 --> 00:11:03,251
Have a seat.

123
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:35,209
What is your name?

124
00:12:39,667 --> 00:12:42,709
I'm here to make things clear.

125
00:12:42,792 --> 00:12:44,292
Go ahead...

126
00:12:47,084 --> 00:12:50,251
I was engaged when I was in hometown.

127
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:53,584
I know, Mrs. Chai told me.

128
00:12:59,126 --> 00:13:03,959
If you want to marry me

129
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:07,167
I don't want to hide anything

130
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,626
I was engaged at 19 in the country side.

131
00:13:13,834 --> 00:13:18,167
The Feis lived opposite to us,
he was very good to me.

132
00:13:20,709 --> 00:13:21,876
Then we ran from the war.

133
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:25,876
My cousin and I came
took a boat to Taiwan first

134
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:30,292
Who knows...

135
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:38,251
I don't want to hide it from you.

136
00:13:45,334 --> 00:13:52,459
I was with him...it isn't my first time.

137
00:14:03,126 --> 00:14:06,376
If you don't want me,
we can stop seeing each other

138
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:17,292
Here come the brides

139
00:14:18,126 --> 00:14:20,001
The couple come for a toast.

140
00:14:20,084 --> 00:14:22,001
Buttons up.

141
00:14:22,584 --> 00:14:24,001
Congratulations...

142
00:14:25,917 --> 00:14:27,459
Thank you, cheers.

143
00:14:27,542 --> 00:14:30,542
Come meet your mother, hurry...

144
00:14:30,626 --> 00:14:33,209
Today is the happiest day in your life.

145
00:14:33,292 --> 00:14:35,334
You must drink a least 3 glasses.

146
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:36,376
Say mommy.

147
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,376
Louden

148
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,584
Mommy.

149
00:14:44,876 --> 00:14:46,542
Cheng-hsing, let's go.

150
00:14:47,251 --> 00:14:49,417
It's time for lunch, where are you giong?

151
00:14:49,501 --> 00:14:51,292
To Momma Chai's home.

152
00:14:53,376 --> 00:14:55,084
Don't go at this time.

153
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:57,751
Stay home...Cheng-hsing!

154
00:14:58,667 --> 00:14:59,792
Why should we listen to you?

155
00:14:59,876 --> 00:15:01,417
You are not my mother!

156
00:15:06,001 --> 00:15:07,084
Cheng-chuan!

157
00:16:49,917 --> 00:16:51,334
Are you Mrs. Hou?

158
00:16:54,501 --> 00:16:57,251
I saw you at the wedding.

159
00:16:58,417 --> 00:16:59,751
He's inside.

160
00:17:00,876 --> 00:17:01,876
Thank you.

161
00:17:07,334 --> 00:17:09,167
He's in the last room.

162
00:17:21,917 --> 00:17:23,917
It's ok...it's my wife.

163
00:17:27,584 --> 00:17:28,834
It's 0k...

164
00:17:28,917 --> 00:17:30,667
Why are you here?

165
00:17:31,126 --> 00:17:33,667
I brought you an umbrella, it's raining.

166
00:17:34,417 --> 00:17:39,334
Hou, have your wife take this home.

167
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:40,626
It's clean.

168
00:17:40,709 --> 00:17:43,751
They hardly touched it.

169
00:17:46,417 --> 00:17:47,459
Thanks!

170
00:17:49,209 --> 00:17:51,376
Abalone, great for a midnight snack.

171
00:17:57,501 --> 00:17:58,584
Here, take it.

172
00:17:58,667 --> 00:17:59,626
Thank you.

173
00:18:52,751 --> 00:18:53,792
You are back.

174
00:19:03,876 --> 00:19:05,042
This is for you.

175
00:19:05,126 --> 00:19:05,751
What is it?

176
00:19:05,834 --> 00:19:07,417
Open and see it.

177
00:19:18,042 --> 00:19:19,542
Honeyed jujubes.

178
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:24,584
I never saw any in Taiwan!

179
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:26,834
You can't find jujubes in Taiwan.

180
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:29,292
Chads brother-in-law is a sailor.

181
00:19:30,084 --> 00:19:32,376
He imported the jujubes from Hong Kong

182
00:19:32,459 --> 00:19:34,084
It must be very expensive.

183
00:19:34,167 --> 00:19:35,917
I won a little money.

184
00:19:41,084 --> 00:19:43,167
I don't think is right to gamble at work.

185
00:19:43,251 --> 00:19:46,751
Nobody is watching! Try it!

186
00:19:48,042 --> 00:19:50,334
Let's eat it together tomorrow.

187
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:57,834
I want to eat the dish you took back.

188
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:41,084
Here.

189
00:20:42,501 --> 00:20:43,917
Where's the dish?

190
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:47,459
I threw it.

191
00:20:47,792 --> 00:20:51,709
You threw it? Why?

192
00:21:04,959 --> 00:21:08,209
You think it's dirty?

193
00:21:08,292 --> 00:21:10,626
You should not married a waiter.

194
00:21:10,709 --> 00:21:13,167
Waiters are always at diposal
and are used to eat leftover.

195
00:21:20,376 --> 00:21:22,792
Fuck your diginity.

196
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:22,084
Are you asleep?

197
00:22:25,251 --> 00:22:27,126
Yes.

198
00:22:42,459 --> 00:22:44,792
I don't mean it.

199
00:22:46,959 --> 00:22:49,209
How could I look down on you?

200
00:23:04,709 --> 00:23:11,459
I married you, and I will be with you forever.

201
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:24,251
I just think we should eat our own food.

202
00:23:25,126 --> 00:23:26,959
We don't need leftovers from others.

203
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:59,126
You work in a restaurant as a waiter now.

204
00:24:00,001 --> 00:24:04,084
But I believe if we have the will.

205
00:24:04,209 --> 00:24:07,792
We can have our own restaurant some day.

206
00:24:13,917 --> 00:24:17,626
A small restaurant will be good, too.

207
00:24:33,542 --> 00:24:36,876
Listen to me...listen to me.

208
00:24:36,959 --> 00:24:38,334
Tell me...tell me...

209
00:24:38,417 --> 00:24:44,126
You gamble too much,
and you owed too much money.

210
00:24:45,001 --> 00:24:48,001
Promise me you won't gamble again.

211
00:24:48,084 --> 00:24:50,417
I won't, I won't gamble again.

212
00:24:50,501 --> 00:24:53,292
lam adog ifldo.

213
00:24:58,542 --> 00:24:59,917
Turn off the light.

214
00:25:28,709 --> 00:25:29,959
Daddy.

215
00:25:30,501 --> 00:25:31,917
Why are you back so early?

216
00:25:34,209 --> 00:25:37,376
We should made some cured meat
for Chinese New Year.

217
00:25:38,251 --> 00:25:40,834
New Year? Who cares about New Year?

218
00:25:40,917 --> 00:25:42,209
I quit.

219
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:46,084
I have had enough
from the damned foreigner.

220
00:25:46,167 --> 00:25:48,001
I quit!

221
00:25:50,709 --> 00:25:55,251
I told Hou he is heading to trouble.

222
00:25:55,334 --> 00:25:56,626
He didn't listen

223
00:25:56,709 --> 00:26:01,084
They hid away and played cards again

224
00:26:01,751 --> 00:26:03,376
and were caught at the scene.

225
00:26:03,459 --> 00:26:07,917
They were fired right away.

226
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:12,417
Could somebody help?

227
00:26:12,501 --> 00:26:15,667
How? Foreigners are strict.

228
00:26:27,001 --> 00:26:28,042
Goodbye.

229
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:38,376
Kuei-mei.

230
00:26:43,834 --> 00:26:48,542
Keep it for Chinese New Year.

231
00:26:49,376 --> 00:26:52,251
No. Thanks.

232
00:27:36,584 --> 00:27:40,751
This is the last think I took from home.

233
00:27:43,709 --> 00:27:45,959
I planed to keep it for our baby.

234
00:27:50,626 --> 00:27:54,917
Sell it to pay your debts.

235
00:27:58,126 --> 00:28:03,126
We'll find other way out
when the baby is borned.

236
00:28:11,626 --> 00:28:16,667
Please, don't gamble anymore.

237
00:28:18,959 --> 00:28:23,126
Or you will destroy our family.

238
00:28:24,959 --> 00:28:26,334
Don't...

239
00:28:26,417 --> 00:28:29,209
I want to win.

240
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:31,751
I want to buy something good for you.

241
00:28:32,501 --> 00:28:35,292
You don't know how happy I will be,

242
00:28:35,376 --> 00:28:37,709
just 0t see you smile.

243
00:28:37,792 --> 00:28:44,459
But I can't. Every time...

244
00:28:47,501 --> 00:28:49,084
You think I don't care about our family,

245
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:51,001
don't you?

246
00:29:00,251 --> 00:29:01,667
I know.

247
00:29:15,959 --> 00:29:17,459
I know.

248
00:29:31,667 --> 00:29:33,501
Let me see.

249
00:29:43,459 --> 00:29:46,501
So big. How did baby get in?

250
00:29:48,626 --> 00:29:50,042
You tell me!

251
00:31:15,917 --> 00:31:18,001
I need to take 3% of interests first.

252
00:31:20,084 --> 00:31:25,584
I know, if it weren't for the baby...

253
00:31:25,667 --> 00:31:28,459
Honestly, I really can't bear it.

254
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:49,292
I got it. You can't take it from me.

255
00:31:53,626 --> 00:31:54,584
Time to eat.

256
00:31:58,167 --> 00:31:59,542
What's that?

257
00:32:03,042 --> 00:32:06,709
Give it to me, give it to me.

258
00:32:08,834 --> 00:32:09,876
NOW!

259
00:32:17,876 --> 00:32:21,417
Do you want to be a gambler in future?

260
00:32:22,584 --> 00:32:24,834
Shame on you...

261
00:32:34,209 --> 00:32:35,709
Where's daddy?

262
00:32:35,792 --> 00:32:37,376
He went to the Chen's.

263
00:32:51,209 --> 00:32:53,542
Cheng-chuan.
Did you see the money in my purse?

264
00:32:53,626 --> 00:32:54,876
No.

265
00:33:15,834 --> 00:33:17,126
Who is it?

266
00:33:17,209 --> 00:33:18,167
Open the door.

267
00:33:19,959 --> 00:33:20,917
Who is it?

268
00:33:21,459 --> 00:33:24,459
It's me. Open the door!

269
00:33:24,542 --> 00:33:25,709
Who is it?

270
00:33:38,042 --> 00:33:40,126
Give me my money.

271
00:33:40,126 --> 00:33:41,208
Why are you here?

272
00:33:41,209 --> 00:33:42,501
Give me my money.

273
00:33:43,501 --> 00:33:45,292
What money?

274
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:47,084
Money for my baby.

275
00:33:47,459 --> 00:33:48,917
The money I put in my purse.

276
00:33:49,292 --> 00:33:51,417
What are you talking about?

277
00:33:51,917 --> 00:33:55,126
I See you. Raise 20. Show cards.

278
00:33:56,459 --> 00:33:57,959
Give my money back to me!

279
00:33:58,042 --> 00:34:00,251
Hou, you'd better go home.

280
00:34:00,334 --> 00:34:01,709
Come on.

281
00:34:01,792 --> 00:34:05,042
Now I've got a flush!

282
00:34:10,001 --> 00:34:11,001
Give me my money.
- You are crazy!

283
00:34:11,084 --> 00:34:12,334
Or I Will kill you!

284
00:34:14,792 --> 00:34:15,876
Give my money back to me!

285
00:34:16,501 --> 00:34:17,876
Shit.

286
00:34:21,126 --> 00:34:23,834
Her water breaks.
She's having a baby! Hury!

287
00:34:25,001 --> 00:34:28,792
Hold on...careful...

288
00:34:30,209 --> 00:34:31,584
Don't worry...

289
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:36,251
The Queen of Enlgand is having a baby.

290
00:34:36,334 --> 00:34:38,167
The Queen is having a baby.

291
00:34:40,709 --> 00:34:42,376
It'll be OK after the pain.

292
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:46,001
Hurry.

293
00:35:05,501 --> 00:35:08,959
A boy and a girl, how nice!

294
00:35:12,459 --> 00:35:13,459
They should eat

295
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:18,126
We have to prepare everything in double

296
00:35:21,917 --> 00:35:23,251
Where's your husband?

297
00:35:24,959 --> 00:35:26,376
Outside.

298
00:35:26,459 --> 00:35:28,334
He's got a lot of problems.

299
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:31,126
He said he better stay outside

300
00:35:31,751 --> 00:35:32,917
I'll keep him company.

301
00:35:42,542 --> 00:35:43,834
Does he still gamble?

302
00:35:45,001 --> 00:35:47,167
If he does, our family will be done.

303
00:35:47,667 --> 00:35:49,292
Did he find a job?

304
00:35:52,459 --> 00:35:56,001
He said the economy is bad,
and it is hard to find one.

305
00:36:04,292 --> 00:36:05,917
Sometimes I hate it.

306
00:36:07,417 --> 00:36:09,501
I wish I could leave him.

307
00:36:14,126 --> 00:36:16,584
It's our fate.

308
00:36:17,292 --> 00:36:19,501
We have to stay with whoever we marry.

309
00:36:20,042 --> 00:36:22,667
It would be better not to get married!

310
00:36:23,501 --> 00:36:26,167
Our neighbor MissWu, the old pinster

311
00:36:26,251 --> 00:36:28,292
ls working as a servent

312
00:36:28,376 --> 00:36:30,209
She gets food to eat,
room to stay and money to earn.

313
00:36:30,292 --> 00:36:32,376
She's happy-

314
00:36:36,042 --> 00:36:39,042
She doesn't have to take care
of a man like we do

315
00:37:01,501 --> 00:37:02,501
Dad

316
00:37:03,417 --> 00:37:04,667
Daddy.

317
00:37:15,292 --> 00:37:16,667
Cheng-fang.

318
00:37:17,792 --> 00:37:20,251
You are my smartest child

319
00:37:21,167 --> 00:37:24,709
Daddy hasn't done well this year

320
00:37:27,376 --> 00:37:29,917
This afternoon, Uncle Chao said...

321
00:37:30,001 --> 00:37:33,834
He could introduce you
to work in a dental clinic.

322
00:37:34,876 --> 00:37:38,792
You can eat and live there, and get paid...

323
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:40,626
Are you crazy?

324
00:37:41,042 --> 00:37:42,126
She should study in school.

325
00:37:42,209 --> 00:37:43,376
And you want her to be a maid?

326
00:37:43,834 --> 00:37:45,251
$0?

327
00:37:45,667 --> 00:37:47,042
You think I like the idea?

328
00:37:47,126 --> 00:37:49,501
I tried hard to find a job

329
00:37:49,584 --> 00:37:51,542
You think I plan to be jobless?

330
00:37:52,376 --> 00:37:55,209
A job won't help if you keep gambling.

331
00:37:55,292 --> 00:37:56,709
There you start again.

332
00:37:56,792 --> 00:37:58,751
Did you see me gamble recently?

333
00:37:58,834 --> 00:38:01,417
Din't you? You played cards yesterday.

334
00:38:02,292 --> 00:38:03,334
Ok. It's my fault.

335
00:38:03,417 --> 00:38:04,917
Just put the blame on me.

336
00:38:05,001 --> 00:38:06,417
You want her to stay in school?

337
00:38:06,501 --> 00:38:07,959
Then you Pay-

338
00:38:08,667 --> 00:38:10,167
Anybody home?

339
00:38:24,292 --> 00:38:25,376
Is your faterh home?

340
00:38:25,459 --> 00:38:26,834
No. He is not home.

341
00:38:26,917 --> 00:38:30,209
He's not? I've been here 8 times.
He's never at home.

342
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:35,126
What a coincident!
Your father always stays out.

343
00:38:35,667 --> 00:38:38,417
Damn! It's only a
few hundred dollars rice bill.

344
00:38:38,501 --> 00:38:41,001
Don't disgrace yourself in the neighborhood.

345
00:38:41,084 --> 00:38:42,876
We are doing a small business.

346
00:38:42,959 --> 00:38:44,792
I don't mind not making money.

347
00:38:44,876 --> 00:38:46,917
But I can't lose my capital.

348
00:38:47,001 --> 00:38:48,792
He is never at home

349
00:38:48,876 --> 00:38:51,376
Then which bastard eat the rice?

350
00:38:51,459 --> 00:38:53,209
Fuck you.

351
00:39:47,292 --> 00:39:50,292
Leave me alone. It's better to be a maid.

352
00:39:50,792 --> 00:39:52,251
He never pay for my cramm school.

353
00:39:52,334 --> 00:39:53,876
I don't want to go to school.

354
00:40:17,542 --> 00:40:19,376
It must be this one.

355
00:40:43,584 --> 00:40:45,792
The family is hiring servants recently

356
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:47,334
The husband is heading to Japan.

357
00:40:47,417 --> 00:40:50,751
The wife wants a couple to help.

358
00:40:50,834 --> 00:40:54,334
People with family are more reliable.

359
00:40:56,167 --> 00:40:57,417
Giong to Japan?

360
00:40:57,501 --> 00:41:00,376
Yes. It depends on Kuei-mei's decision.

361
00:41:00,459 --> 00:41:05,501
Think about it.

362
00:41:05,501 --> 00:41:08,417
Japan is far away.
You can't travel back and forth easily.

363
00:41:08,501 --> 00:41:10,209
We are talking about Japan.

364
00:41:11,042 --> 00:41:12,501
What do you think?

365
00:41:13,584 --> 00:41:14,917
I don't know

366
00:41:16,251 --> 00:41:19,292
Besides, you can take two children, too.

367
00:41:19,834 --> 00:41:22,209
But I have 5 kids.

368
00:41:22,792 --> 00:41:24,334
They don't care about your whole family.

369
00:41:24,709 --> 00:41:27,876
Right. Allowing you to bring
2 children is generous enough.

370
00:41:28,459 --> 00:41:31,667
Usually maids can't bring kids to work.

371
00:41:31,751 --> 00:41:33,751
This is a special deal for you.

372
00:41:37,501 --> 00:41:41,042
It's great! You will earn US dollars!

373
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:44,626
When you arrive Japan,

374
00:41:44,709 --> 00:41:46,542
your husband will have no place to gamble.

375
00:41:47,126 --> 00:41:48,126
Japan?

376
00:41:49,251 --> 00:41:50,459
My uncle was killed by Japanese

377
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:52,126
when he was in Nanjing City.

378
00:41:52,209 --> 00:41:53,751
We coudn't even find his body.

379
00:41:53,834 --> 00:41:56,209
You want me to move to Japan? No way.

380
00:42:00,792 --> 00:42:02,167
I don't want to go, too.

381
00:42:03,209 --> 00:42:08,209
But I want our family to have a better life.

382
00:42:10,709 --> 00:42:13,751
And we'll be working for
Chinese not Japanese.

383
00:42:16,626 --> 00:42:18,876
If you don't want to go, it's fine.

384
00:42:19,876 --> 00:42:21,084
But tell me.

385
00:42:22,542 --> 00:42:24,876
When will you find a job?

386
00:42:26,292 --> 00:42:28,209
When will you put Cheng-fang
back to school?

387
00:42:28,292 --> 00:42:30,501
When will you pay off your gambling debts?

388
00:42:31,876 --> 00:42:37,042
Our family is breaking apart.

389
00:42:42,292 --> 00:42:45,084
Some people get all the money.

390
00:42:47,501 --> 00:42:49,626
We were born to be poor.

391
00:43:17,501 --> 00:43:18,751
Let's go.

392
00:43:36,917 --> 00:43:37,876
Madam.

393
00:43:42,209 --> 00:43:44,209
This is Kuei-mei and Hou.

394
00:43:45,376 --> 00:43:46,251
Good.

395
00:43:47,876 --> 00:43:48,917
Did you explain the rules to them?

396
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:50,292
Yes.

397
00:43:50,376 --> 00:43:51,834
Fine.

398
00:43:52,251 --> 00:43:53,167
I am leaving
- Yes, mam.

399
00:43:53,251 --> 00:43:54,334
Keep them for dinner.

400
00:43:59,251 --> 00:44:00,876
OK. That's it.

401
00:44:00,959 --> 00:44:02,251
She wants you to stay for dinner.

402
00:44:02,334 --> 00:44:05,042
There's leftover from party last night.

403
00:44:17,001 --> 00:44:18,167
You tell them.

404
00:44:20,001 --> 00:44:24,959
I...I can't.

405
00:44:32,001 --> 00:44:33,167
You tell them.

406
00:44:50,584 --> 00:44:54,251
We don't want to leave any of you.

407
00:44:57,917 --> 00:45:00,542
But we cannot all move to Japan.

408
00:45:01,709 --> 00:45:05,959
Your dad and I have thought it over.

409
00:45:06,917 --> 00:45:08,251
We decided...

410
00:45:12,917 --> 00:45:16,209
Cheng-chuan didn't pass the test.
He can study in Japan.

411
00:45:18,501 --> 00:45:27,292
Cheng-min are sickly and need care.

412
00:45:35,501 --> 00:45:41,292
Cheng-fang, you are the eldest kid here

413
00:45:44,334 --> 00:45:46,417
Take good care of your two brothers.

414
00:45:49,917 --> 00:45:54,209
Listen to Auntie

415
00:47:56,167 --> 00:47:57,292
7 dots.

416
00:48:18,292 --> 00:48:22,126
Kuei-mei,
did my husband call this afternoon?

417
00:48:22,209 --> 00:48:23,126
No.

418
00:48:24,876 --> 00:48:25,751
7 bamboos.

419
00:48:27,584 --> 00:48:32,501
Yun-zi, although you married for year,
you are like newly wed.

420
00:48:32,584 --> 00:48:34,584
You checked if he call three
times this afternoon.

421
00:48:35,542 --> 00:48:38,042
Just wonder if he will come back for dinner.

422
00:48:39,167 --> 00:48:41,876
You've got to keep an eye on men.

423
00:48:41,959 --> 00:48:43,917
Mrs. Wei's is good at this.

424
00:48:44,001 --> 00:48:47,417
She keeps a tight rein on Mr. Wei.

425
00:48:47,501 --> 00:48:48,209
Not at all.

426
00:48:49,501 --> 00:48:53,959
I heard the Japanese keep Mr. Wei busy.

427
00:48:56,542 --> 00:48:58,334
Were it not for business.

428
00:48:58,417 --> 00:49:00,917
Who'd like to move here?

429
00:49:02,334 --> 00:49:05,584
For the long term, US is better.

430
00:49:55,917 --> 00:49:58,001
With that woman in your office...

431
00:49:58,626 --> 00:50:02,334
People QOSSiP-

432
00:50:02,792 --> 00:50:03,876
You should...

433
00:50:09,251 --> 00:50:10,751
Who told you to come in?

434
00:50:18,292 --> 00:50:19,167
Get out!

435
00:50:21,626 --> 00:50:22,667
Yes.

436
00:50:51,959 --> 00:50:53,876
They're fighting again

437
00:50:58,001 --> 00:51:00,917
I never saw any couple like them

438
00:51:01,001 --> 00:51:02,959
Pretending happy in front of people

439
00:51:03,042 --> 00:51:05,459
but fighting in the back.

440
00:51:07,917 --> 00:51:11,001
So a proper match is important.

441
00:51:11,626 --> 00:51:14,626
The husband depends own the wife's family

442
00:51:15,042 --> 00:51:16,834
How can it be easy for him?

443
00:51:18,251 --> 00:51:20,084
I heard his fater in-law is a high official.

444
00:51:21,542 --> 00:51:24,209
His father in-law likes him because
he is well educated

445
00:51:26,251 --> 00:51:29,459
Have you heard? The man wants to divorce.

446
00:51:30,542 --> 00:51:33,167
He can't take it anymore
but the wife doesn't agree.

447
00:51:36,001 --> 00:51:39,459
Marriage is meangless to them.

448
00:51:39,542 --> 00:51:43,126
They should divorce.

449
00:51:43,209 --> 00:51:46,001
The woman won't agree because
she doesn't want to lose face.

450
00:51:46,876 --> 00:51:49,459
What is it? Letter from Taipei?

451
00:51:49,542 --> 00:51:51,084
What does it say?

452
00:51:51,167 --> 00:51:53,417
It says everything is fine.

453
00:51:54,584 --> 00:51:56,001
Fine?

454
00:51:56,792 --> 00:51:59,959
The twin who live with us is fat and healthy.

455
00:52:00,251 --> 00:52:02,334
The other in Taipei is thin and weak.

456
00:52:03,667 --> 00:52:05,959
You cousin is not taking good care of them.

457
00:52:09,251 --> 00:52:09,917
Speaking of the girl

458
00:52:10,001 --> 00:52:11,876
Does the husband really has a mistress?

459
00:52:11,959 --> 00:52:12,917
You tell me...

460
00:52:13,626 --> 00:52:15,667
I'm his driver.

461
00:52:15,751 --> 00:52:18,126
But I don't always stick with him

462
00:52:19,209 --> 00:52:20,251
He's quite old

463
00:52:20,334 --> 00:52:21,917
Having a mistress at this age

464
00:52:22,376 --> 00:52:24,334
Must be a lot of fun

465
00:52:36,084 --> 00:52:38,751
Mommy, Brother fights.

466
00:52:43,626 --> 00:52:45,042
Good girl, go in first.

467
00:53:20,001 --> 00:53:22,792
Brother fights, brother is bad.

468
00:53:23,876 --> 00:53:25,584
Why are you back so early?

469
00:53:30,084 --> 00:53:31,126
You fight again?

470
00:53:31,751 --> 00:53:34,501
Japanese says I am Chinese slave.

471
00:53:36,667 --> 00:53:38,792
What?

472
00:53:38,792 --> 00:53:39,833
They say I am a Chinese slave.

473
00:53:39,834 --> 00:53:42,126
Din't you told me if they said that again,

474
00:53:42,209 --> 00:53:43,667
I can beat them?

475
00:53:48,417 --> 00:53:50,126
But you can't leave school.

476
00:53:51,792 --> 00:53:53,209
I don't want to go to school.

477
00:53:53,376 --> 00:53:56,001
I don't want to study any more. It's boring.

478
00:53:56,209 --> 00:53:58,667
Didn't the Chef introduce me
to learn cooking?

479
00:53:58,917 --> 00:54:00,709
I should better be a cook.

480
00:54:01,501 --> 00:54:03,084
I don't want to go to school.

481
00:54:15,626 --> 00:54:17,001
Go clean up.

482
00:54:18,417 --> 00:54:19,876
I'll fix your wounds.

483
00:54:35,251 --> 00:54:36,376
Please.

484
00:54:40,126 --> 00:54:41,376
Goodbye.

485
00:54:43,292 --> 00:54:45,042
To repeat a year in school is fine.

486
00:54:45,126 --> 00:54:47,584
You should listen to your parents.

487
00:54:48,084 --> 00:54:52,334
You can learn something else,
but always work hard.

488
00:54:53,626 --> 00:54:55,459
Well then, bye.

489
00:54:56,709 --> 00:55:03,126
Bye. I'm fine. Good bye.

490
00:55:12,126 --> 00:55:13,584
Damn.

491
00:55:29,251 --> 00:55:30,751
What else did the teacher say?

492
00:55:30,834 --> 00:55:33,209
I don't understand Japanese too well.

493
00:55:33,292 --> 00:55:37,334
What she meant was, the kid flunked.

494
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:40,959
I told you he doesn't like to study.

495
00:55:41,042 --> 00:55:43,292
He should learn cooking in Yokohama.

496
00:55:43,709 --> 00:55:46,376
Just like me, it's not that bad.

497
00:55:46,459 --> 00:55:48,542
It's better than to stay here and go astray.

498
00:56:04,167 --> 00:56:07,167
You want to be a cook.

499
00:56:07,959 --> 00:56:09,667
Waterever you choose,

500
00:56:09,751 --> 00:56:11,417
You have to work had.

501
00:56:11,834 --> 00:56:14,292
You can't quit. Do you understand?

502
00:56:14,376 --> 00:56:17,376
If you quit easily,
you'll be a loser in your whole life.

503
00:56:46,084 --> 00:56:50,542
You must “stand to the Master Chef.

504
00:56:55,792 --> 00:56:57,667
Take care of yourself.

505
00:57:00,417 --> 00:57:01,959
Please take care of him.

506
00:57:02,042 --> 00:57:03,376
Of course I will.

507
00:57:03,751 --> 00:57:05,167
Bye.

508
00:57:05,251 --> 00:57:06,834
Be good.

509
00:57:08,417 --> 00:57:09,167
Go.

510
00:57:53,292 --> 00:57:54,542
Smells great!

511
00:57:58,459 --> 00:57:59,876
It's delicious.

512
00:58:04,667 --> 00:58:07,917
You cook better and better.

513
00:58:08,001 --> 00:58:10,917
Don't you know who taught her?

514
00:58:11,167 --> 00:58:13,417
If Kuei-mei opens a restaurant in Taipei,

515
00:58:13,501 --> 00:58:15,167
she will succeed.

516
00:58:19,626 --> 00:58:20,917
Why do you want to go back?

10517
00:58:22,084 --> 00:58:25,334
America stops supporting Taiwan.
It's not a good time.

518
00:58:26,167 --> 00:58:27,959
The US military will retreat soon.

519
00:58:28,042 --> 00:58:30,167
It's better to stay here for some more years.

520
00:58:30,251 --> 00:58:33,917
Stay here for some more years?
You take leave everv two or three davs

521
00:58:34,001 --> 00:58:35,709
Sooner or later will be the boss quit

522
00:58:35,792 --> 00:58:38,084
Without a visa, you have to go back to Taipei

523
00:58:38,167 --> 00:58:41,667
Nonsense.
If I stay away from the japanese cops,

524
00:58:42,334 --> 00:58:44,042
I can stay anywhere in Tokyo.

525
00:58:44,126 --> 00:58:45,459
No problem.

526
00:58:47,001 --> 00:58:48,126
They are fighting again.

527
00:58:53,417 --> 00:58:54,376
Do want something to eat?

528
00:58:54,459 --> 00:58:55,709
No, thanks.

529
00:58:58,167 --> 00:58:59,251
Kuei-mei!

530
00:59:05,584 --> 00:59:07,001
Save it.

531
00:59:07,084 --> 00:59:08,042
Wei Chen-tung.

532
00:59:08,667 --> 00:59:11,084
Divorce? Not in your life!

533
00:59:12,167 --> 00:59:13,084
Call a car.

534
00:59:13,167 --> 00:59:14,292
Yes.

535
01:00:00,792 --> 01:00:03,917
You see us fighting all the time

536
01:00:05,334 --> 01:00:07,251
What do you think?

537
01:00:10,292 --> 01:00:12,751
We fight all the time, too.

538
01:00:46,501 --> 01:00:49,834
After I left yesterday,

539
01:00:49,917 --> 01:00:52,417
what did my husband say?

540
01:00:55,542 --> 01:00:56,917
Nothing.

541
01:00:57,876 --> 01:00:59,126
Nothing?

542
01:01:01,834 --> 01:01:03,584
Are you sure?

543
01:01:04,001 --> 01:01:07,084
I heard that you talked for a long time.

544
01:01:16,876 --> 01:01:18,834
I know you have no place to go.

545
01:01:18,917 --> 01:01:20,709
Or I'd have dismissed you long time ago.

546
01:01:33,917 --> 01:01:38,001
I don't want to work here anymore.

547
01:01:45,292 --> 01:01:49,292
What happened?
The woman gave you a hard time again?

548
01:02:03,792 --> 01:02:08,251
The driver can introduce us to
work in a restaurant.

549
01:02:08,334 --> 01:02:11,792
The work is harder but the pay is better.

550
01:02:12,292 --> 01:02:15,334
We can save more money and go home.

551
01:02:15,834 --> 01:02:18,667
We can open a restarant by ourselves.

552
01:02:24,126 --> 01:02:28,209
Leaving...to an unfamiliar place...

553
01:02:30,959 --> 01:02:33,084
They are Chinese, too.

554
01:02:58,917 --> 01:03:01,251
The Japanese call mahjongg "sparrow".

555
01:03:01,334 --> 01:03:03,001
It's a business here.

556
01:03:04,209 --> 01:03:05,584
Why are you starring at me?

557
01:03:05,667 --> 01:03:07,626
Have you ever seen me gamble here?

558
01:03:39,126 --> 01:03:42,751
Hello, we are Mr. Wang's friends.

559
01:03:43,501 --> 01:03:44,792
I know. Have a seat.

560
01:03:45,959 --> 01:03:47,209
Thank you.

561
01:03:58,959 --> 01:04:01,876
We don't have working-visa.

562
01:04:01,959 --> 01:04:04,959
I know. Just hide when the cops come.

563
01:04:08,417 --> 01:04:09,584
Sit.

564
01:04:17,959 --> 01:04:19,376
Sorry to keep you waiting.

565
01:05:50,167 --> 01:05:53,834
Damn! I'm working like a dog.

566
01:05:56,667 --> 01:05:59,584
The work 'rs 10 “mes
harder than at the Wars.

567
01:06:02,709 --> 01:06:04,376
What are you diong?

568
01:06:07,459 --> 01:06:09,209
I cut myself with a bowl.

569
01:06:14,209 --> 01:06:15,501
Let me see.

570
01:06:21,209 --> 01:06:25,667
It serves you right.
You wanted to come to Japan.

571
01:06:27,001 --> 01:06:29,167
You wanted to leave the Wei's.

572
01:06:59,834 --> 01:07:03,042
Cops! Hou! Hide!

573
01:07:06,167 --> 01:07:07,334
Welcome.

574
01:07:23,292 --> 01:07:25,209
Let me check your documents.

575
01:07:25,292 --> 01:07:26,209
Sure.

576
01:07:30,959 --> 01:07:33,251
Mommy, let's watch TV.

577
01:08:04,501 --> 01:08:06,084
Damn.

578
01:08:11,709 --> 01:08:12,209
Damn it.

579
01:08:12,292 --> 01:08:13,417
Let me see.

580
01:08:13,626 --> 01:08:15,709
Fuck! I carried dishes all my life,

581
01:08:15,792 --> 01:08:18,167
and done all disreputable jobs,

582
01:08:18,876 --> 01:08:21,542
but I never hid from cops! Fuck.

583
01:08:30,251 --> 01:08:31,751
How long have you came here?

584
01:08:32,417 --> 01:08:33,459
3 years.

585
01:08:35,001 --> 01:08:36,751
Do you plan to go home?

586
01:08:37,709 --> 01:08:44,001
I want to bring my family here.

587
01:08:44,792 --> 01:08:46,042
And you?

588
01:08:47,542 --> 01:08:50,209
We send our son to learn
to cook in Yokohama.

589
01:08:50,834 --> 01:08:52,209
He's still an apprentice.

590
01:08:55,209 --> 01:08:57,042
We'll go back before him.

591
01:08:58,667 --> 01:09:02,792
What for? It's good here.

592
01:09:03,876 --> 01:09:07,209
It's easy to find jobs and make money .

593
01:09:10,751 --> 01:09:13,501
Nomatter how good it is, it isn't our home.

594
01:09:14,626 --> 01:09:18,584
We want to open a restaurant in Taiwan.

595
01:09:21,959 --> 01:09:25,334
It isn't easy, lots of people failed.

596
01:09:46,626 --> 01:09:47,667
We are back!

597
01:09:48,709 --> 01:09:50,917
How do you like the place?

598
01:09:51,876 --> 01:09:53,001
Great.

599
01:09:58,626 --> 01:10:00,667
Cheng-fang...you grow up.

600
01:10:02,417 --> 01:10:03,501
Mommy.

601
01:10:09,459 --> 01:10:10,584
Cheng-hsing.

602
01:10:19,709 --> 01:10:20,792
Cheng-fang.

603
01:10:20,876 --> 01:10:21,709
Come...

604
01:10:37,876 --> 01:10:39,292
So thin.

605
01:11:24,667 --> 01:11:26,917
They're all different now.

606
01:11:51,459 --> 01:11:52,501
Welcome.

607
01:11:58,376 --> 01:11:59,876
Here's your beef with rice.

608
01:12:06,001 --> 01:12:07,126
Here's your soup.

609
01:12:08,584 --> 01:12:09,334
Your soup.

610
01:12:09,959 --> 01:12:12,751
I'd like some beef with rice.

611
01:12:12,834 --> 01:12:13,626
Curry.

612
01:12:14,376 --> 01:12:15,459
Curry.

613
01:12:17,126 --> 01:12:20,292
Curry. OK, thanks.

614
01:12:23,626 --> 01:12:25,251
A beef with rice and a curry.

615
01:12:27,292 --> 01:12:28,417
Here.

616
01:12:30,709 --> 01:12:31,709
Where are you going?

617
01:12:32,876 --> 01:12:34,042
Library.

618
01:12:42,501 --> 01:12:44,417
She should help, we are busy.

619
01:12:44,792 --> 01:12:46,459
Let her go, she has a test.

620
01:12:46,542 --> 01:12:49,001
Don't let her wear the miniskirt.

621
01:12:49,542 --> 01:12:50,292
She shouldn't show her legs like that.

622
01:12:50,376 --> 01:12:51,334
It's inappropriate.

623
01:12:54,042 --> 01:12:56,459
That's fashion.

624
01:13:20,792 --> 01:13:21,917
I'm giong out.

625
01:13:22,209 --> 01:13:23,209
It's late, where are you going?

626
01:13:23,751 --> 01:13:25,876
To visit some old friends with Old Chang.

627
01:13:26,417 --> 01:13:27,459
I can't say no.

628
01:13:27,751 --> 01:13:30,876
He said I can't abandon friends

629
01:13:31,417 --> 01:13:32,709
I will come back soon.

630
01:13:56,167 --> 01:13:57,251
Who was it?

631
01:13:58,001 --> 01:13:59,001
A classmates' brother.

632
01:14:01,251 --> 01:14:03,126
Invite him home next time.

633
01:14:14,209 --> 01:14:15,376
Not bad.

634
01:14:22,042 --> 01:14:22,876
Rest time?

635
01:14:23,626 --> 01:14:25,792
Lunch time has passed,
there's some time to dinner

636
01:14:26,626 --> 01:14:27,251
Have a seat.

637
01:14:33,876 --> 01:14:36,042
Here's your money, 22,000.

638
01:14:41,167 --> 01:14:42,126
You put on weight.

639
01:14:44,167 --> 01:14:47,167
And so busy, too. What can I do?

640
01:14:48,167 --> 01:14:51,376
I don't drink lemon tea with sugar.
Who drink tea with sugar?

641
01:14:52,959 --> 01:14:54,292
It comes with the meal.

642
01:14:55,001 --> 01:14:57,584
Customers like western style.

643
01:14:57,667 --> 01:14:59,417
It attracts customer.

644
01:14:59,501 --> 01:15:00,959
I don't like it.

645
01:15:01,042 --> 01:15:04,042
Taipei is more westernize now.

646
01:15:04,334 --> 01:15:08,792
Like you are serving western food
and coffee...

647
01:15:08,792 --> 01:15:09,834
Where is Hou?

648
01:15:10,917 --> 01:15:11,751
He went out.

649
01:15:12,667 --> 01:15:13,626
Playing cards again?

650
01:15:16,126 --> 01:15:19,084
Old friends said he had to go.

651
01:15:20,209 --> 01:15:22,376
There's nothing wrong to play cards.

652
01:15:22,459 --> 01:15:24,501
As long as he doesn't play women.

653
01:15:26,542 --> 01:15:27,709
He won't.

654
01:15:29,126 --> 01:15:31,251
Men becomes wolfish
when they have money.

655
01:15:31,751 --> 01:15:32,876
It's hard to tell.

656
01:15:38,709 --> 01:15:41,876
Cheng-fang's got a boyfriend.

657
01:15:41,959 --> 01:15:42,959
You know that?

658
01:15:43,042 --> 01:15:46,126
No! I never saw one before.

659
01:15:48,626 --> 01:15:50,751
She is too young to have a boyfriend.

660
01:15:52,626 --> 01:15:55,501
There's nothing wrong to have a boyfriend.

661
01:15:56,209 --> 01:15:57,792
As long as he is a proper fellow.

662
01:15:59,709 --> 01:16:01,209
You are open-minded.

663
01:16:01,292 --> 01:16:03,417
Living abroad makes you a different person.

664
01:16:10,084 --> 01:16:11,167
Cheng-hsnig. Open the door.

665
01:16:16,542 --> 01:16:17,542
Close the door.

666
01:16:20,334 --> 01:16:21,209
Where is your dad?

667
01:16:21,959 --> 01:16:23,417
A woman called.

668
01:16:23,501 --> 01:16:24,876
She asked him to play cards.

669
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:29,167
What woman?

670
01:16:30,292 --> 01:16:33,042
She called several times,
I answered the phones many times.

671
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:54,834
Sister is back.

672
01:16:57,167 --> 01:16:58,084
I don't want to listen to you!

673
01:16:58,167 --> 01:16:58,792
Cheng-fang.

674
01:16:58,876 --> 01:16:59,751
I don't want to listen to you!

675
01:17:03,042 --> 01:17:04,626
Why do you touch me? Don't pull me.

676
01:17:07,834 --> 01:17:09,959
No! Tell your mom.

677
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:12,001
You don't dare to, do you?

678
01:17:14,334 --> 01:17:15,584
Cheng-fang.

679
01:17:17,834 --> 01:17:18,834
You fight?

680
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:38,084
It's ok to have a boyfriend

681
01:17:39,001 --> 01:17:40,251
But whatever happens,

682
01:17:40,334 --> 01:17:42,417
you should let us know. So we won't worry.

683
01:17:43,751 --> 01:17:46,501
Worry?
You left us and went to Japan for years.

684
01:17:46,584 --> 01:17:47,751
Why should you worry now?

685
01:17:47,834 --> 01:17:50,042
I'll see what you can worry about.

686
01:18:05,084 --> 01:18:06,542
Don't be obstinate with me.

687
01:18:08,959 --> 01:18:10,209
You are still young.

688
01:18:10,792 --> 01:18:13,459
Of course I worry about you.

689
01:18:15,001 --> 01:18:16,417
When you get into college,

690
01:18:17,542 --> 01:18:20,167
I won't worry about you anymore, ok?

691
01:19:00,709 --> 01:19:01,501
Cheng-hsing...

692
01:19:02,542 --> 01:19:03,251
Cheng-hsing!

693
01:19:06,709 --> 01:19:07,626
Cheng-fang.

694
01:19:11,667 --> 01:19:12,584
Cheng-fang!

695
01:19:17,001 --> 01:19:18,042
Cheng-fang!

696
01:19:21,459 --> 01:19:22,917
Do you hear me?

697
01:19:24,917 --> 01:19:27,209
Bring your younger brother.
The water is coming in.

698
01:19:28,792 --> 01:19:29,876
Cheng-fang!

699
01:19:32,334 --> 01:19:33,876
Min-min, come.

700
01:19:33,959 --> 01:19:35,667
Don't be afraid, let me hug you.

701
01:19:43,959 --> 01:19:45,084
Mom.

702
01:19:45,167 --> 01:19:47,959
Don't be afraid, here, mom is here.

703
01:19:48,042 --> 01:19:49,376
Go to my room.

704
01:19:51,042 --> 01:19:53,376
Why are you still sitting there, Cheng-fang?

705
01:20:03,501 --> 01:20:04,376
Little brother.

706
01:20:10,084 --> 01:20:11,251
Don't move.

707
01:20:35,751 --> 01:20:38,001
Mom, where's dad?

708
01:20:42,417 --> 01:20:43,626
If the water keeps rising,

709
01:20:44,959 --> 01:20:49,001
We go to the roof.

710
01:21:38,751 --> 01:21:40,792
What a mess!

711
01:21:49,626 --> 01:21:51,792
I planed to come back last night,

712
01:21:51,876 --> 01:21:53,834
but the wind was too strong.

713
01:21:53,917 --> 01:21:55,792
There wasn't a single taxi...

714
01:22:01,001 --> 01:22:02,126
Come, let me help...

715
01:22:02,459 --> 01:22:04,667
What are you doing?

716
01:22:05,334 --> 01:22:08,417
Didn't you ask me to check the house price?

717
01:22:12,459 --> 01:22:13,667
When we come to Taiwan,

718
01:22:13,751 --> 01:22:15,251
the price was $200 for 3.3 square meter.

719
01:22:15,334 --> 01:22:16,334
I didn't want it.

720
01:22:16,417 --> 01:22:19,001
Now it's more expensive.

721
01:22:20,917 --> 01:22:24,292
Chang says,
you can't take a house with you.

722
01:22:24,751 --> 01:22:27,376
You better buy gold.

723
01:23:12,501 --> 01:23:14,251
I'm sorry. We are closed.

724
01:23:14,334 --> 01:23:16,709
Excuse me, does Hou live here?

725
01:23:16,792 --> 01:23:18,709
How can I help you?

726
01:23:24,001 --> 01:23:25,084
Come in.

727
01:23:29,126 --> 01:23:29,751
Have a seat.

728
01:23:29,834 --> 01:23:30,667
Thank you.

729
01:23:42,334 --> 01:23:44,334
Is there anything that you can't tell me?

730
01:23:47,376 --> 01:23:52,084
I'm here to ask him.
He said he will be good to us.

731
01:23:55,792 --> 01:23:59,584
But I have not seen him for a long time.

732
01:24:10,876 --> 01:24:13,001
Is that it?

733
01:24:32,626 --> 01:24:34,042
I'm not that kind of...

734
01:24:41,042 --> 01:24:43,001
loose woman.

735
01:24:49,001 --> 01:24:51,084
Cheng-hsing...Cheng-hsing...

736
01:24:51,167 --> 01:24:53,042
Where are you?

737
01:24:53,126 --> 01:24:53,834
Cheng...

738
01:25:19,084 --> 01:25:20,584
The woman...

739
01:25:28,292 --> 01:25:30,167
Her husband is in jail.

740
01:25:30,959 --> 01:25:35,626
I played mahjongg at her house.

741
01:25:39,042 --> 01:25:40,876
In the typhoon night...

742
01:25:42,459 --> 01:25:44,042
I planned to come back.

743
01:25:44,709 --> 01:25:46,417
But I couldn't leave.

744
01:25:48,292 --> 01:25:49,292
So we...

745
01:25:55,876 --> 01:25:57,751
It won't happen again.

746
01:25:58,501 --> 01:26:02,126
I'll make it clear to her. Never again.

747
01:26:06,001 --> 01:26:08,251
What are you doing?

748
01:26:10,959 --> 01:26:15,167
I'm leaving you. I want a divorce.

749
01:26:15,251 --> 01:26:19,001
Divorce? What do you mean by divorce?

750
01:26:21,042 --> 01:26:23,001
You learned from Mrs. Wei in Japan?

751
01:26:23,084 --> 01:26:24,834
Why do you learn that?

752
01:26:25,876 --> 01:26:27,209
I don't need to learn from others.

753
01:26:29,167 --> 01:26:30,709
I can suffer a hard life with you.

754
01:26:31,584 --> 01:26:34,501
But I will not forgive you to have an affair.

755
01:26:42,001 --> 01:26:45,084
There are plenty of jobs, I can survive.

756
01:26:47,709 --> 01:26:49,001
When I settle down,

757
01:26:50,251 --> 01:26:51,709
I'll take all the kids.

758
01:26:56,084 --> 01:26:57,792
I'll come back to pick them up.

759
01:27:56,667 --> 01:27:57,834
Mom.

760
01:27:58,959 --> 01:27:59,917
Come here.

761
01:28:28,584 --> 01:28:30,626
Cheng-fang left.

762
01:28:37,584 --> 01:28:39,792
We checked with her classmate

763
01:28:41,542 --> 01:28:44,042
They said she has a boyfriend.

764
01:28:47,417 --> 01:28:49,251
They met in a library.

765
01:28:51,251 --> 01:28:52,876
I don't where he lives.

766
01:28:55,917 --> 01:28:59,001
Since you left, everything is a mess.

767
01:28:59,084 --> 01:29:01,334
Cheng-hsing burned himself on a pot.

768
01:29:08,167 --> 01:29:09,709
Is your brother hurt badly?

769
01:29:10,167 --> 01:29:12,001
He's okay now.

770
01:29:14,917 --> 01:29:18,001
Daddy, pretend I'm not your daughter.

771
01:29:18,084 --> 01:29:19,042
I'm leaving.

772
01:29:19,459 --> 01:29:22,042
Maybe what I do will make you lose face.

773
01:29:22,126 --> 01:29:23,667
But I will never regret.

774
01:29:24,459 --> 01:29:26,626
You never understand me.

775
01:29:26,709 --> 01:29:28,792
And you never will.

776
01:29:28,876 --> 01:29:31,501
So please don't find me.

777
01:29:52,417 --> 01:29:55,917
Stay away from the kitchen. It's dangerous.

778
01:29:56,001 --> 01:29:58,334
Dad told me to go and help out.

779
01:30:09,917 --> 01:30:10,792
Hello?

780
01:30:12,084 --> 01:30:12,667
This is she.

781
01:30:16,251 --> 01:30:18,376
I see... I'll be right there.

782
01:30:21,876 --> 01:30:26,001
She came and wanted to
marry our son Ah-sheng.

783
01:30:26,084 --> 01:30:28,667
At first I thought she was joking.

784
01:30:28,751 --> 01:30:30,917
But she stood there.

785
01:30:31,001 --> 01:30:32,709
And wouldn't leave.

786
01:30:33,459 --> 01:30:36,042
We were scared.

787
01:30:38,959 --> 01:30:41,459
Right...lf she's really pregnant,

788
01:30:41,542 --> 01:30:43,709
we would take the responsibility.

789
01:30:43,792 --> 01:30:46,626
But Mrs. Hou...

790
01:30:46,709 --> 01:30:49,834
Look at her.

791
01:30:49,917 --> 01:30:51,667
It's impossible that they get married now.

792
01:30:51,751 --> 01:30:56,084
They are kids. They need to study.

793
01:30:56,167 --> 01:30:59,792
Besides,
Ah-sheng wouldn't dare to marry her.

794
01:31:03,709 --> 01:31:06,959
Right, it's Ah-sheng's fault.

795
01:31:07,626 --> 01:31:09,417
The baby...

796
01:31:09,917 --> 01:31:12,542
We don't want to give up the baby.

797
01:31:12,626 --> 01:31:15,167
But we can't help.

798
01:31:15,251 --> 01:31:16,376
Can't help?

799
01:31:19,167 --> 01:31:21,126
Sit, chill out.

800
01:31:23,459 --> 01:31:26,167
I think we should calm down.

801
01:31:26,251 --> 01:31:29,876
Let's find a way to solve the problem.

802
01:31:29,959 --> 01:31:32,459
We can pay for it.

803
01:31:41,876 --> 01:31:45,834
Mrs. Lin,Cheng-fang is young.

804
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:47,834
She doesn't know anything.

805
01:31:49,084 --> 01:31:52,209
She might not be pregnant.

806
01:31:53,501 --> 01:31:56,501
She's too ignorant

807
01:31:57,917 --> 01:31:59,501
and she believes people easily

808
01:32:00,626 --> 01:32:02,209
If she knows what you said

809
01:32:03,084 --> 01:32:05,834
she should give up and stops being silly.

810
01:32:06,792 --> 01:32:09,542
We will talk to her.

811
01:32:11,376 --> 01:32:12,751
Today...

812
01:32:13,376 --> 01:32:15,251
We'll peretend nothing happened.

813
01:32:47,292 --> 01:32:49,084
I'll beat you to death.

814
01:32:49,792 --> 01:32:51,751
What are youd doing?

815
01:32:51,834 --> 01:32:52,667
Hou Yung-nien!

816
01:32:54,542 --> 01:32:56,917
Come on! Beat me to death!

817
01:32:57,001 --> 01:32:59,542
I don't care! Let me die!

818
01:33:00,501 --> 01:33:01,876
Hou Yung-nien!

819
01:33:05,501 --> 01:33:07,667
Hou Yung-nien! Stop!

820
01:33:08,917 --> 01:33:10,417
You want to kill her, don't you?

821
01:33:12,667 --> 01:33:14,709
What is it?

822
01:34:03,792 --> 01:34:06,251
Feeling unwell?

823
01:34:07,501 --> 01:34:10,459
Dr. Lin, I've been here before.

824
01:34:10,542 --> 01:34:12,251
I had my babies here

825
01:34:17,501 --> 01:34:20,292
Mrs. Hou, twins.

826
01:34:20,959 --> 01:34:22,209
They must be big now.

827
01:34:22,292 --> 01:34:23,334
Yes.

828
01:34:23,417 --> 01:34:24,792
Going to primary school.

829
01:34:27,459 --> 01:34:28,501
So...

830
01:34:33,834 --> 01:34:34,917
I'm here today

831
01:34:36,292 --> 01:34:38,376
to ask for your help.

832
01:34:41,209 --> 01:34:42,917
It's my daughter.

833
01:34:43,792 --> 01:34:45,501
She's only 15.

834
01:34:48,959 --> 01:34:53,042
And she...she's probably pregnant.

835
01:34:59,667 --> 01:35:01,209
Letting it happen,

836
01:35:02,126 --> 01:35:05,667
We are also responsble

837
01:35:12,584 --> 01:35:16,834
We can't destroy her life...

838
01:37:28,334 --> 01:37:30,251
No one can suffer on behalf of Cheng-fang.

839
01:37:31,042 --> 01:37:32,959
No one.

840
01:37:34,209 --> 01:37:36,501
She had to grow up.

841
01:37:38,001 --> 01:37:39,876
When Cheng-fang went to college,

842
01:37:40,709 --> 01:37:42,292
we got a loan from the bank.

843
01:37:43,334 --> 01:37:46,334
Bought a house and run the restaurant.

844
01:37:47,334 --> 01:37:48,792
The business was good.

845
01:37:52,417 --> 01:37:53,959
A husband having an affair

846
01:37:54,751 --> 01:37:56,834
is worse than gambling.

847
01:37:57,751 --> 01:37:59,751
But you have two choices,

848
01:38:00,709 --> 01:38:03,167
to leave or to forgive.

849
01:38:04,459 --> 01:38:06,459
Nether are easy.

850
01:38:07,667 --> 01:38:09,584
But you have to choose one.

851
01:38:14,126 --> 01:38:17,584
This is Cheng-chuan,
he married a Japanese lady.

852
01:38:21,167 --> 01:38:23,751
Cheng-hsing studied International Business.

853
01:38:23,834 --> 01:38:27,126
This is hisoffice and his wife.

854
01:38:31,126 --> 01:38:33,584
When the twins graduated from college,

855
01:38:33,667 --> 01:38:35,126
we took this photo.

856
01:38:36,792 --> 01:38:38,917
But Cheng-chuan's family were not there.

857
01:39:14,251 --> 01:39:17,042
Everybody grows old.

858
01:39:18,667 --> 01:39:20,209
When we were young,

859
01:39:21,001 --> 01:39:22,876
we never think about it.

860
01:39:24,709 --> 01:39:28,667
We not only grow old, but being ill.

861
01:39:44,292 --> 01:39:45,626
Women...

862
01:39:46,959 --> 01:39:49,376
He never cheated on me since then.

863
01:39:50,751 --> 01:39:54,834
But still, he gambles sometimes.

864
01:39:58,917 --> 01:40:03,417
Yet since he knew I have uterus cancer,

865
01:40:04,959 --> 01:40:07,209
he quit gambling.

866
01:40:43,751 --> 01:40:45,667
Kids have grown up.

867
01:40:46,834 --> 01:40:49,376
They have their own business.

868
01:40:50,251 --> 01:40:52,167
After I was in the hospital,

869
01:40:52,959 --> 01:40:55,126
The restaurant

870
01:40:55,209 --> 01:40:57,709
is handled by Cheng-fang.

871
01:40:59,376 --> 01:41:00,876
Everyone says that

872
01:41:01,667 --> 01:41:03,876
she becomes more and more like me.

873
01:41:58,292 --> 01:41:59,751
You should pick them up

874
01:42:00,709 --> 01:42:02,959
from the airport

875
01:42:04,084 --> 01:42:06,001
No fathers will pick up their sons.

876
01:42:08,417 --> 01:42:09,667
Stubborn man.

877
01:42:10,459 --> 01:42:11,417
Grandma!

878
01:42:14,626 --> 01:42:16,417
Grandpa! Grandma!

879
01:42:17,376 --> 01:42:18,417
Everyone is here.

880
01:42:18,501 --> 01:42:19,376
Grandma!

881
01:42:19,459 --> 01:42:20,542
Come here, Bow-bow.

882
01:42:20,626 --> 01:42:21,792
Bow-bow, Bei-bei.

883
01:42:21,876 --> 01:42:23,417
Say hello to your grandparents.

884
01:42:24,917 --> 01:42:25,501
Dad.

885
01:42:25,792 --> 01:42:26,292
Dad.

886
01:42:26,376 --> 01:42:26,876
Mom.

887
01:42:26,959 --> 01:42:27,459
Mom.

888
01:42:27,542 --> 01:42:28,792
Granpa, grandma.

889
01:42:29,084 --> 01:42:31,084
Dad.
- Grandma is sick.

890
01:42:32,376 --> 01:42:33,042
Mom

891
01:42:33,126 --> 01:42:35,792
Mom you look better.

892
01:42:36,751 --> 01:42:38,251
Don't pull me.

893
01:42:38,334 --> 01:42:39,751
Let auntie see.

894
01:42:40,251 --> 01:42:42,209
Bei-bei, do you miss me?

895
01:42:42,792 --> 01:42:44,001
Yes?

896
01:42:44,459 --> 01:42:45,751
Mariko, say hello to grandma.

897
01:42:45,834 --> 01:42:46,334
Hurry

898
01:42:46,417 --> 01:42:47,626
Grandma.

899
01:42:47,709 --> 01:42:50,292
She speaks Japanese
with her mom in Japan.

900
01:42:50,376 --> 01:42:51,292
There is no way.

901
01:42:53,376 --> 01:42:55,042
Let grandpa see you

902
01:42:57,501 --> 01:42:58,084
Dad.

903
01:42:58,167 --> 01:43:00,709
A Japanese baby, huh?

904
01:43:02,959 --> 01:43:04,167
Call "grandpa".

905
01:43:04,251 --> 01:43:05,959
Can you say it?

906
01:43:06,042 --> 01:43:06,667
Take it.

907
01:43:06,751 --> 01:43:08,501
Behave yourself.

908
01:43:08,584 --> 01:43:10,042
What do you want to eat, Bei-bie?

909
01:43:10,459 --> 01:43:11,417
Cheng-chuan, you gained weight.

910
01:43:11,876 --> 01:43:12,751
85 kg now.

911
01:43:12,834 --> 01:43:14,709
Bow-bow...

912
01:43:15,126 --> 01:43:16,292
Did you take the pills?

913
01:43:17,292 --> 01:43:18,501
Yes.

914
01:43:18,917 --> 01:43:20,792
Come, let's find grandma.

915
01:43:20,876 --> 01:43:22,751
Give them some apples.

916
01:43:23,459 --> 01:43:24,626
Grandma.

917
01:43:25,042 --> 01:43:26,167
You're naughty.

918
01:43:26,251 --> 01:43:27,876
Let them go.

919
01:43:31,667 --> 01:43:32,709
About your divorce...

920
01:43:32,792 --> 01:43:34,667
Dad is upset about it for a while.

921
01:43:35,292 --> 01:43:37,501
What can I do?

922
01:43:37,584 --> 01:43:39,376
You don't want to stay in Taipei?

923
01:43:40,334 --> 01:43:42,126
It's not easy to make money outside.

924
01:43:42,751 --> 01:43:44,542
Even if you speak Japanese well,

925
01:43:44,626 --> 01:43:46,542
they still see you as a foreigner.

926
01:43:46,959 --> 01:43:52,292
But I'm used to living in Japan.

927
01:43:52,376 --> 01:43:53,876
Taipei is strange place to me.

928
01:43:54,626 --> 01:43:58,001
I wish you could stay and
take over the restaurant.

929
01:44:02,834 --> 01:44:04,209
It's impossible.

930
01:44:05,334 --> 01:44:06,834
How's the business?

931
01:44:06,917 --> 01:44:08,084
Lots of competition.

932
01:44:08,167 --> 01:44:09,751
It's hard to make money.

933
01:44:10,501 --> 01:44:11,709
But the house worth a lot.

934
01:44:14,959 --> 01:44:18,417
I think, the problem is the way
of running the restaurant.

935
01:44:19,376 --> 01:44:21,251
The menu is old fashion.

936
01:44:21,542 --> 01:44:23,376
The decoration is old.

937
01:44:24,334 --> 01:44:27,209
Mom and dad take care of the restaurant.

938
01:44:27,542 --> 01:44:29,001
I seldom come here.

939
01:44:29,084 --> 01:44:30,209
After she became sick,

940
01:44:30,292 --> 01:44:33,459
I quit my job at school and came.

941
01:44:35,626 --> 01:44:39,209
I planned to study abroad
for one or two years.

942
01:44:40,876 --> 01:44:42,709
Study abroad? At your age?

943
01:44:43,292 --> 01:44:44,126
You should get married.

944
01:44:44,209 --> 01:44:45,834
I'm not joking.

945
01:44:45,917 --> 01:44:48,167
I haven't told anyone else.

946
01:44:50,292 --> 01:44:51,167
How about Cheng-hsing?

947
01:44:51,251 --> 01:44:53,792
He think it's too hard.

948
01:44:53,876 --> 01:44:56,292
Chang-shun wants to move to the States.

949
01:44:57,626 --> 01:44:59,834
Two quick meals with orange juice.

950
01:44:59,917 --> 01:45:01,542
The toilet is leaking.

951
01:45:01,626 --> 01:45:03,042
Why don't you have somebody fix it?

952
01:45:03,126 --> 01:45:04,417
I'm sorry. I don't know that.

953
01:45:04,501 --> 01:45:06,167
I don't use lady's room.

954
01:45:07,542 --> 01:45:09,459
Who change the music? Turn it off.

955
01:45:09,542 --> 01:45:10,792
Didn't Mrs. Hou set the rules?

956
01:45:10,876 --> 01:45:12,542
Music with singing is not permitted.

957
01:45:12,626 --> 01:45:14,626
What...What's wrong with you?

958
01:45:19,209 --> 01:45:21,501
Here...Come over here. Look.

959
01:45:21,584 --> 01:45:22,917
What kind of place is this?

960
01:45:23,001 --> 01:45:23,667
As soon as Mrs. Hou leaves,

961
01:45:23,751 --> 01:45:25,584
you mess up the place.

962
01:45:25,792 --> 01:45:27,001
Don't you have self-respect?

963
01:45:27,084 --> 01:45:28,751
Go in. Cheng-chuan's there.

964
01:45:28,834 --> 01:45:30,042
Don't scold here.

965
01:45:30,126 --> 01:45:31,542
It's hard to find one these days.

966
01:45:31,626 --> 01:45:33,959
So what? We can do the work ourselves!

967
01:45:34,042 --> 01:45:35,209
Fine, fine.

968
01:45:35,292 --> 01:45:37,459
What a mess...

969
01:45:44,709 --> 01:45:45,792
Where's Cheng-hsing?

970
01:45:45,876 --> 01:45:49,376
He's busy in and out.

971
01:45:49,459 --> 01:45:51,709
But he earn little.

972
01:45:51,792 --> 01:45:53,626
Sis, there's something
I want to discuss with you.

973
01:45:53,709 --> 01:45:54,959
What is it?

974
01:45:55,042 --> 01:45:57,001
I found a place at Zhongxiao Eset Rd.

975
01:45:57,084 --> 01:45:58,626
I want to open a consignment store.

976
01:45:58,709 --> 01:46:01,417
If we close the Chavannes,

977
01:46:01,501 --> 01:46:03,126
we can work together...

978
01:46:03,209 --> 01:46:04,751
Who said we will close the restaurant?

979
01:46:04,834 --> 01:46:06,167
Who will take care of the place then?

980
01:46:06,251 --> 01:46:08,417
Isn't Cheng-chuan returning to Japan?

981
01:46:08,501 --> 01:46:11,334
Business is not well recently.

982
01:46:11,417 --> 01:46:13,917
Cheng-hsing says it should be closed.

983
01:46:15,084 --> 01:46:17,251
Only dad can make such decision.

984
01:46:17,334 --> 01:46:18,709
It's not our business.

985
01:46:19,334 --> 01:46:21,667
I know nothing about consignment.

986
01:46:21,751 --> 01:46:22,834
Why don't you ask Cheng-min?

987
01:46:22,917 --> 01:46:25,751
Cheng-min? I don't want to bother her.

988
01:46:25,834 --> 01:46:27,709
It isn't the same, you know.

989
01:46:27,792 --> 01:46:28,626
What the differences?

990
01:46:28,709 --> 01:46:30,167
Of course it's different.

991
01:46:30,251 --> 01:46:33,084
Mom treats you and the twins diffrerently.

992
01:46:33,792 --> 01:46:35,167
I don't think there are any differences.

993
01:46:38,084 --> 01:46:39,334
Go on and eat.

994
01:46:42,042 --> 01:46:43,584
Stop playing-

995
01:46:50,209 --> 01:46:52,417
Didn't you say you wanted oranges?

996
01:46:52,501 --> 01:46:55,417
In summer, there are only frozen organes.

997
01:46:55,501 --> 01:46:56,209
Is it expensive?

998
01:46:56,292 --> 01:46:58,292
Less expensive than peaches .

999
01:46:58,376 --> 01:47:00,042
You're stingy.

1000
01:47:01,501 --> 01:47:03,334
I'm not as generous as you are.

1001
01:47:04,459 --> 01:47:06,834
Spending 8000NTD for a dress.

1002
01:47:06,917 --> 01:47:09,001
It's imported from Japan.
It's expensive of course.

1003
01:47:10,001 --> 01:47:11,917
I don't know why it is good.

1004
01:47:14,042 --> 01:47:16,709
Mom. He's here. I'm leaving.

1005
01:47:19,834 --> 01:47:21,417
Save six seats for me tonight.

1006
01:47:21,501 --> 01:47:23,626
Where's dad?

1007
01:47:25,292 --> 01:47:26,167
I'm treating my friends. See you.

1008
01:47:26,251 --> 01:47:28,417
Said he was giong to buy some tonic.

1009
01:47:28,501 --> 01:47:29,917
Whatever.

1010
01:47:35,751 --> 01:47:37,709
Leaveit

1011
01:47:50,709 --> 01:47:56,209
Did Cheng-chuan tell you he was leaving?

1012
01:48:04,209 --> 01:48:09,751
Cheng-hsing and Cheng-chun
have their own plans.

1013
01:48:17,834 --> 01:48:24,542
Cheng-fang, if you don't want the restaurant,

1014
01:48:28,126 --> 01:48:31,834
I'll try to persuade your father...

1015
01:48:35,251 --> 01:48:36,709
To sell the place...

1016
01:48:44,292 --> 01:48:46,084
I know he won't agree.

1017
01:48:54,417 --> 01:48:56,251
I'll tell him nicely.

1018
01:48:59,542 --> 01:49:01,209
I'll do it.

1019
01:49:13,917 --> 01:49:16,084
I'd like to go out for a walk.

1020
01:49:18,959 --> 01:49:20,459
When the doctor says you can go,

1021
01:49:20,542 --> 01:49:23,792
I'll borrow Cheng-hsing's car for us.

1022
01:49:42,751 --> 01:49:45,792
Your mom left some jewelry.

1023
01:49:46,376 --> 01:49:50,042
She said Cheng-chuan is about to leave.

1024
01:49:52,167 --> 01:49:54,542
So she wanted me to give it to you.

1025
01:49:58,459 --> 01:50:02,209
She said it's just souvernirs.

1026
01:50:03,834 --> 01:50:06,792
She doensn't know if it's fair or not.

1027
01:50:09,792 --> 01:50:15,751
She wanted to be fair to you all her life.

1028
01:50:18,876 --> 01:50:21,334
She had a hard time.

1029
01:50:21,417 --> 01:50:25,042
It's too late to be good to her now.

1030
01:50:27,001 --> 01:50:29,084
OK. That's it!

1031
01:50:32,042 --> 01:50:34,876
Cheng-min will soon get married.

1032
01:50:38,709 --> 01:50:41,292
Cheng-fang is handling the restaurant.

1033
01:50:41,376 --> 01:50:42,167
OK.

1034
01:50:44,334 --> 01:50:48,292
Come back to visit when you have time.

1035
01:50:49,792 --> 01:50:51,209
OK. That's all.

1036
01:50:51,292 --> 01:50:53,959
Dad, Cheng-fang will get
married sooner or later.

1037
01:50:57,459 --> 01:50:59,251
Dad can't handle the
restaurant all by himself.

1038
01:51:00,042 --> 01:51:02,251
You should sell the restaurant.

1039
01:51:03,834 --> 01:51:06,542
Sell it? Why?

1040
01:51:07,626 --> 01:51:10,542
Dad, you can relax if it's sold.

1041
01:51:11,584 --> 01:51:15,667
I'm fine. I don't want to relax.

1042
01:51:15,751 --> 01:51:20,126
Your mom and I worked hard for the place.

1043
01:51:20,209 --> 01:51:22,501
I won't sell it, never!

1044
01:51:25,001 --> 01:51:26,167
As long as I am alive,

1045
01:51:26,251 --> 01:51:28,626
don't you ever mention this again.

1046
01:51:35,042 --> 01:51:37,376
Were Cheng-chun
and Cheng-min born here?

1047
01:51:39,042 --> 01:51:40,084
Yes.

1048
01:51:42,251 --> 01:51:45,501
I've been thinking these years.

1049
01:51:47,251 --> 01:51:49,792
Maybe we shouldn't have gone to Japan.

1050
01:51:51,292 --> 01:51:53,167
And left you alone.

1051
01:51:54,834 --> 01:52:00,292
You must felt awful.

1052
01:52:01,042 --> 01:52:04,292
I feel okay now.

1053
01:52:04,376 --> 01:52:08,584
But did you really forgive dad that time?

1054
01:52:11,834 --> 01:52:13,167
About the affair?

1055
01:52:16,001 --> 01:52:21,584
We're couple. One of us has to be tolerant.

1056
01:52:21,667 --> 01:52:23,876
Why are always women being tolerant?

1057
01:52:27,042 --> 01:52:30,209
Is that why you don't want to get married?

1058
01:52:33,167 --> 01:52:38,084
I think you shouldn't have forgiven dad.

1059
01:52:42,167 --> 01:52:43,459
Maybe you're right.

1060
01:52:45,042 --> 01:52:48,042
But you wouldn't want us to divorce now.

1061
01:53:05,334 --> 01:53:08,709
It that the rich cousin
who open the restaurant?

1062
01:53:11,084 --> 01:53:13,459
I thought she has a cancer,
how can she come?

1063
01:53:14,084 --> 01:53:15,251
Lower your voice

1064
01:53:15,334 --> 01:53:17,792
Let's go. After dinner.

1065
01:53:17,876 --> 01:53:19,376
Come and continue the game. Don't forget.

1066
01:53:19,459 --> 01:53:20,917
OK.

1067
01:53:22,001 --> 01:53:26,209
Hsiao-feng, make some tea
for your auntie and cousin.

1068
01:53:27,167 --> 01:53:28,084
Auntie.

1069
01:53:28,292 --> 01:53:29,126
Cheng-fang.

1070
01:53:29,209 --> 01:53:30,501
Have a seat.

1071
01:53:30,584 --> 01:53:31,376
Here.

1072
01:53:36,834 --> 01:53:38,001
Thank you.

1073
01:53:38,751 --> 01:53:41,959
Cheng-fang,
do you remember Momma Chai?

1074
01:53:42,042 --> 01:53:43,167
Momma Chai.

1075
01:53:43,251 --> 01:53:46,834
You always went to Chai's house,
and drank milk at church.

1076
01:53:47,459 --> 01:53:51,167
I wouldn't recognize her now.

1077
01:53:52,376 --> 01:53:55,667
Mrs. Chai moved to next door last month.

1078
01:53:55,751 --> 01:53:57,126
Isn't it a coincidence?

1079
01:53:57,876 --> 01:54:00,459
Kuei-mei, you've put on a lot of weight.

1080
01:54:00,542 --> 01:54:04,126
Your cousin is getting thinner and thinner.

1081
01:54:04,209 --> 01:54:05,334
Her health is not good

1082
01:54:05,417 --> 01:54:07,084
but she still plays mahjongg.

1083
01:54:09,084 --> 01:54:11,251
Or what else should I do?

1084
01:54:11,251 --> 01:54:14,708
I'm cooped in this damn house.

1085
01:54:14,709 --> 01:54:16,626
Like a bird in the cage.

1086
01:54:17,584 --> 01:54:21,334
Unlike you, you have a business to do.

1087
01:54:24,167 --> 01:54:26,417
After my husband passed away...

1088
01:54:26,501 --> 01:54:31,501
I don't even have anybody to fight with.

1089
01:54:32,209 --> 01:54:34,542
It sounds like you love to fight.

1090
01:54:35,376 --> 01:54:38,126
Then you can argue with
my husband everyday.

1091
01:54:38,209 --> 01:54:40,376
Let's see if you can handle it.

1092
01:54:42,417 --> 01:54:43,542
Know what?

1093
01:54:45,251 --> 01:54:49,626
Chai's Chinese wife came from Hong Kong.

1094
01:54:50,376 --> 01:54:52,876
After so many hard years,

1095
01:54:52,959 --> 01:54:54,292
of couse she is not happy.

1096
01:54:55,459 --> 01:54:58,542
I'm not unhappy, I'm furious.

1097
01:54:59,292 --> 01:55:02,584
He told me he wasn't married.

1098
01:55:03,042 --> 01:55:05,084
But now there's another wife.

1099
01:55:05,459 --> 01:55:08,334
He sent her money every month.

1100
01:55:08,417 --> 01:55:13,042
He also sent her TV, radio, and other stuff.

1101
01:55:15,417 --> 01:55:17,042
What could you do about it?

1102
01:55:18,959 --> 01:55:20,792
What could I do?

1103
01:55:23,542 --> 01:55:27,584
I suffered. The kids have grown up.

1104
01:55:28,626 --> 01:55:31,501
When I feel good, I forgive him.

1105
01:55:31,584 --> 01:55:34,417
When I feel bad, I fight with him.

1106
01:55:34,959 --> 01:55:37,667
You've married for 30 years, right?

1107
01:55:38,459 --> 01:55:41,334
You're old now. What can you do?

1108
01:55:43,126 --> 01:55:45,834
Kuei-mei,
there's something I forget to tell you.

1109
01:55:49,334 --> 01:55:52,751
I asked Chai to have his Hong Kong wife

1110
01:55:52,834 --> 01:55:55,834
check the situation of our hometown.

1111
01:55:55,917 --> 01:56:00,542
You'll never guess who sent us a package.

1112
01:56:13,126 --> 01:56:14,292
Look.

1113
01:56:20,167 --> 01:56:24,084
Fei Chen-pang. Your former fiance!

1114
01:56:24,167 --> 01:56:25,626
Is it him?

1115
01:56:30,001 --> 01:56:34,126
There's no letter.
It's inconvenient to tell everything.

1116
01:56:34,709 --> 01:56:38,209
He said he's happy to
know you are well here.

1117
01:56:39,834 --> 01:56:44,376
He has 2 daughters and
hope to send them out.

1118
01:57:30,209 --> 01:57:32,251
I want to discuss with you.

1119
01:57:34,834 --> 01:57:38,667
I'd like to renovate the Chavannes.

1120
01:57:40,334 --> 01:57:45,792
And change the manage way.

1121
01:57:56,459 --> 01:58:02,126
That's good. I can count on you.

1122
01:58:22,209 --> 01:58:26,501
I'll leave the matter of the Fei's to you.

1123
01:58:38,876 --> 01:58:40,959
Take care of your dad.

1124
01:58:43,667 --> 01:58:48,626
Ask him to play cards
when he has nothing to do.

1125
01:58:52,584 --> 01:58:57,584
He's old and has no other habbit.

1126
01:58:59,542 --> 01:59:08,042
Playing cards can make him feel better.

1127
01:59:11,292 --> 01:59:13,876
You're tired. Go get some sleep.
