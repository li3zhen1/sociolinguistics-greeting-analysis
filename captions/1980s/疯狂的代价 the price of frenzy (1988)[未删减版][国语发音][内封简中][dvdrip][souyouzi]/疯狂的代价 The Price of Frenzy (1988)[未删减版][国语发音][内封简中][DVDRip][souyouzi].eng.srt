Lanlan,dont be afraid.You have grown up

8
00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.169

this when they grow up

Now Lanlan
you have grown up to be a colleen

10
00:02:27.848 --> 00:02:39.851
OBSESSION

11
00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:45.255
Right,hold on and exert yourself

12
00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:47.323
Good,try harder!

13
00:02:49.636 --> 00:02:51.069
Ok,let down slowly

14
00:02:51.538 --> 00:02:53.005
Hold on

15
00:02:55.242 --> 00:02:55.799
Let down

16
00:02:58.945 --> 00:03:01.038
Come on,once again

17
00:03:01.882 --> 00:03:04.282
Ok it will be fine in no timeCarry on

18
00:03:04.785 --> 00:03:06.252
Exert yourself

19
00:03:07.287 --> 00:03:09.118
Exert yourself

20
00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:11.147
Ok

21
00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:24.328
You are so close to the fan again
Be careful of your health

22
00:03:26.807 --> 00:03:29.799
I have tried so hard just
to enjoy this moment

23
00:03:30.343 --> 00:03:31.537
You come and play,too

24
00:03:33.113 --> 00:03:37.447
Qingqing,I didnt find out
that your neck is as nice

25
00:03:37.818 --> 00:03:39.513
as the beauty in the pictorial

26
00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:41.953
Hey,check whether
I have prickly heat or not

27
00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.323
Ijustsaid thatyouwere fat
you really then breathed
heavily like a lard-bucket

28
00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:49.995
No.48 has been seven days late

29
00:03:50.197 --> 00:03:53.633
If she does not take caesarean birth
she is likely to suffer massive hemorrhage

30
00:03:54.034 --> 00:03:55.331
But her husband didnt allow

31
00:03:56.103 --> 00:03:57.661
He said that it would
be ugly if a scar is left

32
00:03:57.704 --> 00:03:59.137
What a baddy

33
00:03:59.172 --> 00:04:01.037
His wifes life has been in danger

34
00:04:01.074 --> 00:04:03.508
Have him responsible for
the birth and bear the pain

35
00:04:04.311 --> 00:04:07.178
It is said that making man pregnant instead
is under research in foreign countries

36
00:04:07.214 --> 00:04:10.308
If it succeeds
then women can be free from this suffer

37
00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.944
Right,men are pregnant for ten months,too

38
00:04:12.986 --> 00:04:17.252
Then use the scalpel to cut their paunches
and finally sew the incision

39
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.986
Have them go through al
the pain that women have to suffer

40
00:04:20.594 --> 00:04:24.189
And women and men will be equal

41
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.730
Ha,thank you for your great effort

42
00:04:28.769 --> 00:04:29.633
Thank you very much

43
00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.193
Come on,have a drink

44
00:04:31.238 --> 00:04:32.068
Sorry

45
00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:35.097
After B ultrasonography examination
it was a baby girl,but it turns out
to be a boy with your effort

46
00:04:35.675 --> 00:04:38.075
There is always a way out

47
00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:41.706
Excuse me

48
00:04:41.748 --> 00:04:42.772
Can you tell me who the midwife is

49
00:04:42.816 --> 00:04:44.647
It is the woman with a nice neck

50
00:04:45.018 --> 00:04:47.919
Come,this is for you

51
00:04:48.288 --> 00:04:50.688
Take it.This is the second one

52
00:04:51.358 --> 00:04:53.519
It really matches her
She looks like a beautiful goodness

53
00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:57.728
Look,she is so pretty

54
00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:25.122
Shoe,give me,give me

55
00:05:25.458 --> 00:05:26.686
Dont grab

56
00:05:27.894 --> 00:05:29.088
Traveling shoes

57
00:05:29.329 --> 00:05:31.490
Fine,I have not taken any exercise yet

58
00:05:39.306 --> 00:05:40.432
Five seconds

59
00:05:45.245 --> 00:05:46.644
Ten seconds

60
00:05:51.952 --> 00:05:53.317
Fifteen seconds

61
00:05:55.689 --> 00:05:56.815
Is it the time

62
00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:00.426
Not yet

63
00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:04.823
Ok,we can have breakfast now

64
00:06:08.635 --> 00:06:10.159
What do we have

65
00:06:11.471 --> 00:06:13.166
Bread,orange juice and milk

66
00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:14.298
Here you are

67
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:17.872
I have not brushed my teeth yet

68
00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:20.375
You forgot again
Have breakfast first,then brush teeth

69
00:06:24.017 --> 00:06:25.143
When you pass the book house

70
00:06:25.185 --> 00:06:26.550
return the book to Li Changwei

71
00:06:27.354 --> 00:06:28.719
Why not give it back by yourself

72
00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:29.949
Do me a favor,please

73
00:06:30.156 --> 00:06:32.590
Twill take you to
have fun in summer holiday

74
00:06:32.626 --> 00:06:33.593
Really

75
00:06:38.531 --> 00:06:39.463
Twill keep my promise

76
00:06:39.499 --> 00:06:40.523
Ok

77
00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:45.297
61.What a score

78
00:06:45.338 --> 00:06:47.636
My brother has told me to
choose the subject Jam good at

79
00:06:47.674 --> 00:06:49.232
Anay
I am going to study medicine in the future

80
00:06:49.276 --> 00:06:51.141
As long as I can do well
in mathematic physics,chemistry
and foreign language,it will be fine

81
00:06:51.177 --> 00:06:52.235
What is the point of learning history

82
00:06:52.279 --> 00:06:53.337
It is fine to just pass the exam

83
00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.245
You would not exist without history

84
00:06:55.282 --> 00:06:56.909
It is my parents who gave birth to me

85
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.349
not history

86
00:06:58.385 --> 00:07:00.319
My brother said that history
is the least credible

87
00:07:00.353 --> 00:07:01.684
Only science is the most reliable

88
00:07:01.721 --> 00:07:04.417
I always feel that it
is my sister who gave birth to me

89
00:07:04.457 --> 00:07:06.254
It is not scientific.You are totally a laic

90
00:07:06.293 --> 00:07:08.090
even having no idea of
some common knowledge on medicine

91
00:07:08.128 --> 00:07:10.323
Doctor will be the most
promising occupation in the future

92
00:07:10.363 --> 00:07:11.193
It is boring

93
00:07:11.231 --> 00:07:12.357
Just like my sister

94
00:07:12.399 --> 00:07:14.390
She is always together
with pregnant women

95
00:07:14.467 --> 00:07:16.403
and has to comfort them

96
00:07:16.403 --> 00:07:18.064
WeliThat is the job of nurse

97
00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:19.571
You need to take a degree of doctor
if you want to study medicine

98
00:07:37.123 --> 00:07:40.650
San Mao had traveled all around
the world in her life

99
00:07:40.694 --> 00:07:41.956
Have you read her books

100
00:07:41.995 --> 00:07:43.121
I never do light reading

101
00:07:43.363 --> 00:07:45.558
She fell in love when she was eight years old

102
00:07:45.598 --> 00:07:48.123
Later she married a man
with big moustache

103
00:07:48.368 --> 00:07:50.893
He was able to dive

104
00:07:50.937 --> 00:07:53.667
Eight years old? You are kidding

105
00:07:53.707 --> 00:07:55.334
There was little gonad-tropic hormone
when she was eight years old

106
00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:56.842
What a boloney

107
00:07:59.879 --> 00:08:01.210
Goodbye

108
00:08:01.247 --> 00:08:02.407
Goodbye

109
00:08:12.425 --> 00:08:13.687
Hey

110
00:08:18.164 --> 00:08:19.893
I have already make room for you
Why do you still crowd in upon me

111
00:08:22.936 --> 00:08:24.961
Sorry.I didnt mean to

112
00:08:25.005 --> 00:08:26.404
I just pulled on my new clothes

113
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.068
Let me wrap it for you

114
00:08:32.445 --> 00:08:33.935
Stop,stop

115
00:08:34.347 --> 00:08:36.338
You have made it dirtier
How can I come home like this

116
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:41.750
It doesnt matter
no one will notice it since it is so late

117
00:08:42.355 --> 00:08:44.118
What if I muddy you

118
00:08:45.992 --> 00:08:48.222
What about letting me send you home

119
00:08:55.268 --> 00:08:57.566
For heavens sake
Twill not charge you fare

120
00:08:58.405 --> 00:09:00.498
For heavens sake
Twill not askyou to pay for my clothes

121
00:09:21.027 --> 00:09:22.654
Go ahead

122
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.025
Chewing gum

123
00:09:58.565 --> 00:10:00.157
Go along and turn left

124
00:10:11.144 --> 00:10:12.270
Let me get off

125
00:10:13.113 --> 00:10:15.240
Let me get off Stop

126
00:10:16.015 --> 00:10:17.915
Let me

127
00:10:26.559 --> 00:10:27.821
Where can you escape

128
00:11:01.294 --> 00:11:04.320
Wang Qingqing,has her period come

129
00:11:11.871 --> 00:11:15.637
What is the matter

130
00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:28.946
What is his ascent

131
00:11:30.056 --> 00:11:31.683
What are his facial features

132
00:11:32.926 --> 00:11:34.484
Did you bite his hands badly

133
00:11:38.965 --> 00:11:43.834
What is going on

134
00:12:19.305 --> 00:12:21.068
Brother,did you lose or win

135
00:12:25.645 --> 00:12:27.408
What hell are you playing with

136
00:12:27.981 --> 00:12:29.573
Thing that is
not suitable for good guys

137
00:12:30.950 --> 00:12:32.815
You should read some good books

138
00:12:33.720 --> 00:12:35.153
There are no good books

139
00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:38.690
There are a lot of good books

140
00:12:38.992 --> 00:12:41.392
Like Legend of Hero Shooting Vultures
Invincible Yuanyang Legs

141
00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:44.419
both of which are better than this one

142
00:12:44.731 --> 00:12:46.995
All are about men and women
What a mess

143
00:12:50.303 --> 00:12:51.668
What is wrong with your hands

144
00:12:52.605 --> 00:12:53.833
Nothing

145
00:12:54.407 --> 00:12:55.738
What did you do last night

146
00:12:56.409 --> 00:12:57.842
You,come here

147
00:12:58.077 --> 00:12:59.305
Sit down

148
00:12:59.812 --> 00:13:01.575
Dont try to lie,tell me the truth

149
00:13:01.814 --> 00:13:03.304
I just thieved a car for a drive

150
00:13:03.750 --> 00:13:05.183
Whose car

151
00:13:05.618 --> 00:13:07.984
The one in front of the door
I dont know whom it belongs to

152
00:13:08.688 --> 00:13:09.814
Where is the car

153
00:13:10.223 --> 00:13:11.349
I have deserted it

154
00:13:13.026 --> 00:13:15.051
You want more troubles,right

155
00:13:16.095 --> 00:13:18.063
If not for our mothers sake

156
00:13:18.298 --> 00:13:21.233
Twill cut your legs down

157
00:13:31.978 --> 00:13:34.276
The young one or the old one

158
00:13:35.615 --> 00:13:38.379
Is it the old one,The young one

159
00:13:38.418 --> 00:13:39.851
How young that boy is

160
00:13:39.886 --> 00:13:41.183
Maybe it is the old one

161
00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:46.319
How poor the boy is

162
00:13:46.693 --> 00:13:48.524
How piteous

163
00:13:51.631 --> 00:13:53.292
Was it what its like when its found

164
00:13:53.333 --> 00:13:54.732
Yes,it was

165
00:13:59.205 --> 00:14:00.604
At five in this morning

166
00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:02.335
People in Eastern Restaurant reported that

167
00:14:02.608 --> 00:14:04.041
their cars were stolen

168
00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:06.744
A man who fished by the water found it

169
00:14:07.246 --> 00:14:10.079
The type and brand of this car are
coincident with those of the stolen one

170
00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:12.651
Any other clues

171
00:14:13.052 --> 00:14:14.314
The man said

172
00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:17.045
The whole shape of this car

173
00:14:17.090 --> 00:14:20.082
There is a magazine under the car
Look,Qingqing Book House

174
00:14:22.528 --> 00:14:24.018
Bxcept the strange smell of the rope

175
00:14:24.297 --> 00:14:26.094
Did you have other responses

176
00:14:27.033 --> 00:14:30.059
like feeling dry in your mouth

177
00:14:30.103 --> 00:14:31.730
or tearing

178
00:14:36.442 --> 00:14:37.636
Eat this

179
00:14:38.311 --> 00:14:40.074
Dont be afraid.This is just almond

180
00:14:44.450 --> 00:14:45.849
Is this smell

181
00:14:48.821 --> 00:14:50.448
This

182
00:14:58.598 --> 00:15:00.862
Sister,I dont want to smell any more

183
00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.162
Should we do this

184
00:15:06.406 --> 00:15:08.374
Try to think whether it is this smell

185
00:15:09.509 --> 00:15:10.305
I dont know.

186
00:15:10.343 --> 00:15:11.640
My mouth was hurt by the tight rope

187
00:15:11.944 --> 00:15:13.275
Furthermore,I couldnt see anything

188
00:15:13.312 --> 00:15:14.472
How can I know

189
00:15:16.883 --> 00:15:17.941
Stop here

190
00:15:17.984 --> 00:15:19.451
Twill go back by myself

191
00:15:25.091 --> 00:15:27.582
Stop,dont drive ahead any more

192
00:15:51.217 --> 00:15:56.052
Ah,ah

193
00:15:56.088 --> 00:15:56.923
Stop,stop

194
00:15:56.923 --> 00:15:59.483
When women are attacked

195
00:15:59.859 --> 00:16:02.123
they should yell hysterically

196
00:16:02.161 --> 00:16:03.788
exert the utmost strength to

197
00:16:03.830 --> 00:16:05.263
cry out,understand

198
00:16:05.731 --> 00:16:07.699
Ok,once more

199
00:16:09.001 --> 00:16:10.400
Action

200
00:16:18.277 --> 00:16:24.614
Ah,ah

201
00:16:24.851 --> 00:16:26.409
Ok,stop.What are you doing

202
00:16:26.452 --> 00:16:27.282
Making trouble

203
00:16:27.320 --> 00:16:28.753
Jam wanted.I go out for a moment

204
00:16:31.991 --> 00:16:33.083
What is up

205
00:16:33.125 --> 00:16:35.559
The heroine asked me to dub for her

206
00:16:35.962 --> 00:16:37.725
Policemen have
already called on my brother

207
00:16:37.763 --> 00:16:40.857
My brother said that this kind of
magazine was stocked a month ago

208
00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:42.265
The two hundred copies have been sold out

209
00:16:42.301 --> 00:16:43.700
He could not remember the buyers at all

210
00:16:43.736 --> 00:16:46.762
What is more,this magazine
always goes the rounds

211
00:16:46.806 --> 00:16:48.797
Therefore,it is not certain that the
criminal ever bought this magazine

212
00:16:50.209 --> 00:16:52.871
My brother felt rather afflictive

213
00:16:52.912 --> 00:16:55.039
He was reluctant to respond to me

214
00:16:56.215 --> 00:16:57.739
Hey,Qingqing

215
00:16:57.984 --> 00:17:00.418
My brother is really nice to you

216
00:17:07.326 --> 00:17:11.888
Which one? This one
A Satyr from the North

217
00:17:12.732 --> 00:17:15.428
This one,Bugbear

218
00:17:17.069 --> 00:17:18.696
Do you want

219
00:17:18.738 --> 00:17:20.000
If not,give it back

220
00:17:20.273 --> 00:17:23.140
All right,you gave the correct amount

221
00:17:41.127 --> 00:17:43.652
All of my books enjoy
a sound market all over the world

222
00:17:46.465 --> 00:17:47.727
How much does this book cost

223
00:17:47.767 --> 00:17:48.961
1.2 Yuan 1.2 Yuan

224
00:17:49.001 --> 00:17:50.491
What do you think

225
00:17:51.070 --> 00:17:52.537
Do you think it expensive

226
00:17:52.572 --> 00:17:55.040
How thick this book is
Both of its sides are colored

227
00:17:56.208 --> 00:17:57.573
Want to buy or not

228
00:18:01.614 --> 00:18:02.808
Qingqing

229
00:18:03.783 --> 00:18:05.683
You change the sign

230
00:18:09.155 --> 00:18:10.622
Change it or not

231
00:18:14.260 --> 00:18:16.319
What has it to do with the sign

232
00:18:22.702 --> 00:18:23.930
Qingqing

233
00:18:27.707 --> 00:18:29.971
Qingqing

234
00:18:30.009 --> 00:18:31.977
If you have anything to say,please tell me

235
00:18:32.378 --> 00:18:36.371
Qingqing,please dont get angry

236
00:18:36.816 --> 00:18:38.909
Twill tell you.I will tell you slowly

237
00:18:39.685 --> 00:18:40.519
Everyone,I am sorry

238
00:18:40.519 --> 00:18:42.146
Whats the matter?
She tears my book into pieces. Sorry. Sorry

239
00:18:42.188 --> 00:18:43.655
I have pay for it I only lmow that
something has happened to their family

240
00:18:43.689 --> 00:18:44.621
I have the hump

241
00:18:44.690 --> 00:18:46.089
Although unhappy
you still cant tear my book

242
00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:46.819
How about this

243
00:18:46.859 --> 00:18:47.883
I change another book for you

244
00:18:48.561 --> 00:18:50.222
How about this one

245
00:18:50.262 --> 00:18:51.422
Sorry,very sorry

246
00:18:51.464 --> 00:18:53.398
Sorry
Goodbye and Twill drop in another day

247
00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:56.231
Do drop in again

248
00:19:23.763 --> 00:19:26.891
What are you tearing?
Burning them will be easier

249
00:19:32.938 --> 00:19:34.371
Twill pay for you

250
00:19:35.708 --> 00:19:37.676
There are several hundreds
of bookstalls in the whole city

251
00:19:38.778 --> 00:19:40.302
How can you tear all these books up

252
00:19:49.622 --> 00:19:52.648
Although the criminals can escape
to the ends of the earth

253
00:19:58.898 --> 00:20:02.299
After 40 years
they will still be caught and sent to gallows

254
00:20:04.270 --> 00:20:07.330
Anyway,that guy cant escape that far

255
00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:11.138
It would be good if
I had gone to take Lanlan back

256
00:20:13.312 --> 00:20:15.177
What did the policemen say

257
00:20:15.214 --> 00:20:16.875
What could they tell me

258
00:20:18.084 --> 00:20:21.247
Actually I also know what they have known

259
00:20:21.821 --> 00:20:24.722
First,he may have visited the Book House

260
00:20:24.924 --> 00:20:26.858
Second,he has local accent

261
00:20:27.126 --> 00:20:28.252
He is a driver

262
00:20:30.129 --> 00:20:31.756
and he left his footprints

263
00:20:32.898 --> 00:20:36.231
Furthermore,Lanlan once bit his hand

264
00:20:36.268 --> 00:20:38.600
It is possible that a scar
is left on his left hand

265
00:20:40.206 --> 00:20:42.640
Oh,also

266
00:20:42.675 --> 00:20:44.302
He likes chewing gum

267
00:20:45.111 --> 00:20:48.842
The only problem lies
on how Lanlan can recognize him

268
00:20:49.048 --> 00:20:50.276
Moreover,it was dark at that time

269
00:20:50.316 --> 00:20:51.874
Thus she might not recognize exactly

270
00:20:51.951 --> 00:20:53.475
Lanlan needs to go to school

271
00:20:54.153 --> 00:20:58.351
Qingqing,do your parents know this thing

272
00:22:42.728 --> 00:22:45.891
This is the representative of the works
of the Japanese writer Du Bian Chun Yi

273
00:22:45.931 --> 00:22:46.989
The hungry love desire

274
00:22:47.032 --> 00:22:47.828
Extreme in secret

275
00:22:47.867 --> 00:22:48.663
Flaming passions

276
00:22:48.701 --> 00:22:50.168
Who wants? Who wants

277
00:22:50.202 --> 00:22:51.396
How about buying one

278
00:22:51.437 --> 00:22:53.667
Ok

279
00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:56.239
Who would like to buy the book?
Who would like to buy the book

280
00:22:56.275 --> 00:22:58.878
This is the representative one
of Japanese writer Du Bian Chun Yi

281
00:22:58.878 --> 00:23:01.472
The hungry love desire...

282
00:23:20.966 --> 00:23:23.161
It seems that you had an appointment

283
00:23:23.402 --> 00:23:25.267
I picked him up and then it was your turn

284
00:23:25.304 --> 00:23:27.295
He was four hours earlier than you

285
00:23:27.339 --> 00:23:28.237
Yes

286
00:23:28.274 --> 00:23:31.243
We should return,shouldnt we

287
00:23:31.277 --> 00:23:34.337
Can you not come back after
what happened

288
00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:35.574
You are right

289
00:23:36.348 --> 00:23:37.975
If have something to say,tell me here

290
00:23:39.318 --> 00:23:43.015
No matter what,you should
let me see Lanlan first,right

291
00:23:55.067 --> 00:23:56.557
Be quiteBe quiet

292
00:23:57.303 --> 00:24:00.033
Mr.Li is iliThus
Twill take over the classes for him

293
00:24:00.072 --> 00:24:01.664
The course is long-distance
running outside the school

294
00:24:01.974 --> 00:24:04.306
Notice your rhythm of breathing
when running

295
00:24:04.543 --> 00:24:07.307
Run back as soon as you reach
the turning of SI Ping Road

296
00:24:07.646 --> 00:24:09.113
Take care

297
00:24:09.615 --> 00:24:12.049
Why did you take off the shoes

298
00:24:12.284 --> 00:24:13.410
I can run faster if I am barefoot

299
00:24:13.485 --> 00:24:15.146
Just like Zola Bard

300
00:24:15.187 --> 00:24:18.623
Teacher,she is called Zo?
Ally,a family member of the Zola Bards

301
00:24:20.659 --> 00:24:21.921
Be serious

302
00:24:23.429 --> 00:24:27.365
Stand out that girl in the back row
who does not take off the clothes

303
00:24:31.270 --> 00:24:33.329
What are you laughing at

304
00:24:34.173 --> 00:24:35.834
Why did you not take off the clothes

305
00:24:35.874 --> 00:24:38.434
Didnt your parents buy
short sports wear for you

306
00:24:38.677 --> 00:24:41.339
When runing out of the school gate
you represent our school spirit

307
00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:42.404
Teacher

308
00:24:54.059 --> 00:24:58.189
Except this girl
all the students turn right

309
00:24:59.732 --> 00:25:01.859
and run

310
00:25:04.069 --> 00:25:05.627
Ok,close up

311
00:25:06.872 --> 00:25:08.134
Close up

312
00:25:09.108 --> 00:25:10.200
Spread apart

313
00:25:13.212 --> 00:25:15.442
You practice shooting
a basket by yourself first

314
00:25:33.132 --> 00:25:34.827
How much can be earned in a month

315
00:25:34.867 --> 00:25:37.665
You can earn the cost
in less than three years

316
00:25:38.504 --> 00:25:40.301
You can drive such a nice car

317
00:25:40.939 --> 00:25:42.998
puff foreign cigarettes,and drink coke

318
00:25:43.042 --> 00:25:44.475
Lao Zhao,watch it for a moment

319
00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:45.772
Ok

320
00:25:47.012 --> 00:25:50.778
You should put on this kind of dress like his

321
00:25:52.484 --> 00:25:54.008
The older youre
the more loudly you get dressed

322
00:25:54.053 --> 00:25:55.987
You are the only one who
becomes rich first among us

323
00:25:56.321 --> 00:25:58.255
Why dont you have retired early

324
00:25:58.290 --> 00:25:59.621
Like you,turn out for work every day

325
00:25:59.658 --> 00:26:01.717
Only 0.8 yuan per km in the city
and 1.2 yuan in outskirt

326
00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:03.125
Oont you think
that you have worked long enough

327
00:26:03.495 --> 00:26:06.020
Uncle,can I have a cigarette

328
00:26:12.805 --> 00:26:14.636
Lao Zhao,you should
have followed my suit long before

329
00:26:14.673 --> 00:26:17.107
You also can do some contributions
to the four modernizations,right

330
00:26:18.477 --> 00:26:21.037
Uncle,will I be kept in custody

331
00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:22.138
For what

332
00:26:22.781 --> 00:26:24.180
Just because I played mah-jongg

333
00:26:24.249 --> 00:26:26.444
Oh,gambling

334
00:26:26.885 --> 00:26:28.352
Everyone gambles

335
00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:30.547
my parents,my grandparents

336
00:26:30.622 --> 00:26:32.556
my brother and sister all play it

337
00:26:32.624 --> 00:26:33.886
Why did you only capture me

338
00:26:33.926 --> 00:26:35.052
Dont you think it is unfair

339
00:26:35.594 --> 00:26:38.358
As you came in
you confessed all your family members

340
00:26:38.397 --> 00:26:39.887
I don t think it is unfair

341
00:26:39.932 --> 00:26:41.661
Why dont you confess your cahoots

342
00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:43.429
It is they who won
and took all the money away

343
00:26:43.469 --> 00:26:45.164
The police didnt arrest the winners

344
00:26:45.204 --> 00:26:46.728
but only captured me,such a loser,instead

345
00:26:46.972 --> 00:26:48.735
I have been unlucky enough

346
00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:51.435
We catch you and you confess them out

347
00:26:51.477 --> 00:26:53.638
The police then can arrest
them and have the money back

348
00:26:54.146 --> 00:26:55.374
Really

349
00:26:57.149 --> 00:26:58.673
Dont mock me

350
00:27:01.787 --> 00:27:03.584
You bought this gasoline
at high price,didnt you

351
00:27:03.655 --> 00:27:06.783
Bought the gasoline?
I dont have so much money

352
00:27:06.825 --> 00:27:09.293
I will try to borrow a car to you

353
00:27:09.328 --> 00:27:11.193
Four to five hundreds a month

354
00:27:11.230 --> 00:27:12.993
Really Yes

355
00:27:13.031 --> 00:27:17.468
Then I can buy a piano to my grandson after
I have worked for one or two years

356
00:27:17.503 --> 00:27:18.731
Quite right

357
00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:19.930
Now this is popular

358
00:27:23.041 --> 00:27:26.841
Captain,I am suffering a diarrhea
I couldnt hold out much longer

359
00:27:26.879 --> 00:27:29.109
Can you see it? It is at least the
second time that he has been imprisoned

360
00:27:29.348 --> 00:27:30.372
I really couldnt hold out any more

361
00:27:30.415 --> 00:27:31.382
Go,go,go

362
00:27:31.450 --> 00:27:33.543
Please wait for a minute
Ok

363
00:27:37.489 --> 00:27:39.889
Lao Bait you cant buy parts back

364
00:27:39.925 --> 00:27:41.187
we cant do the work

365
00:27:41.426 --> 00:27:43.291
no use complaining to me

366
00:27:43.996 --> 00:27:46.624
The bank said that we have overdrawn

367
00:27:47.032 --> 00:27:50.991
I dont see any hopes left for our stall

368
00:27:56.542 --> 00:27:58.874
Here you are, Catch

369
00:28:00.445 --> 00:28:01.469
Cover the gasoline basin

370
00:28:01.513 --> 00:28:02.571
Ok

371
00:28:09.288 --> 00:28:10.812
There is something wrong
with our boss today

372
00:28:11.423 --> 00:28:13.357
Both of them must know inside out

373
00:28:13.392 --> 00:28:14.518
There is really nothing to that

374
00:28:14.726 --> 00:28:16.421
Our boss was subpoenaed by the police

375
00:28:17.262 --> 00:28:18.354
I want to return to my hometown

376
00:28:18.397 --> 00:28:21.332
Maybe the police will make arrest again

377
00:28:22.568 --> 00:28:25.264
It is possible about
the thing happened in the chapel

378
00:28:25.571 --> 00:28:26.560
What is it?

379
00:28:27.072 --> 00:28:30.371
What? A teen-age girl was attacked

380
00:28:30.642 --> 00:28:33.509
It is said that she
was bubbled by the chauffeur

381
00:28:33.545 --> 00:28:35.035
Her eyes were covered

382
00:28:35.080 --> 00:28:36.570
The criminal like this will be
shot directly when is caught

383
00:28:37.049 --> 00:28:39.745
One is charger,one is theft

384
00:28:40.752 --> 00:28:43.118
A daughter must be taken good care of

385
00:28:43.589 --> 00:28:45.250
Mine is ahoy

386
00:28:45.524 --> 00:28:47.355
You have quarreled
with your wife for three months

387
00:28:47.826 --> 00:28:49.418
It is probable the trouble your son has made

388
00:28:49.461 --> 00:28:51.326
Puck you

389
00:28:51.363 --> 00:28:54.992
Ah,dont tweak

390
00:28:55.033 --> 00:28:57.331
If I was hurt badly
you would fail to have a little brother

391
00:29:00.405 --> 00:29:04.603
In the past,it was considered that having
a boy or a girl is depended upon by women

392
00:29:05.277 --> 00:29:07.643
This is obviously a kind of blind faith

393
00:29:08.146 --> 00:29:12.105
Actually,it is not the mans will that
decide whether to have a boy or a girl

394
00:29:12.684 --> 00:29:15.209
All right,boys and girls
do you have any other questions

395
00:29:15.254 --> 00:29:16.380
Teacher

396
00:29:17.256 --> 00:29:18.314
Stand up

397
00:29:18.357 --> 00:29:19.119
Mr.Yang

398
00:29:19.157 --> 00:29:20.681
Your statement has been outdated

399
00:29:20.993 --> 00:29:22.790
This is what the teaching materials say

400
00:29:23.562 --> 00:29:25.223
Then it is the teaching
materials that are outdated

401
00:29:28.166 --> 00:29:29.463
Huang Xiaolin

402
00:29:29.968 --> 00:29:31.993
What is the new idea you have invented

403
00:29:32.037 --> 00:29:35.404
I did not invent itIt is what the book says

404
00:29:36.008 --> 00:29:37.942
What is about? Can you read it?

405
00:29:37.976 --> 00:29:39.136
I am sorry

406
00:29:40.379 --> 00:29:41.471
It doesnt matter

407
00:29:41.513 --> 00:29:44.914
It is fine to let
students know the new viewpoint

408
00:29:47.886 --> 00:29:51.083
According to the research of Banger
Harrison,a Swiss medical doctor

409
00:29:51.323 --> 00:29:54.417
The prospect that human can decide the
gender of our offspring is in sight

410
00:29:54.459 --> 00:29:55.687
As everyone knows

411
00:29:55.961 --> 00:30:00.057
It is the chromosome XY
and XX that decide the gender

412
00:30:00.332 --> 00:30:03.995
The traveling speed
and the life-span of these two
spermatozoa are quite different

413
00:30:04.036 --> 00:30:07.528
Besides,the PH of the womans secretion

414
00:30:07.739 --> 00:30:12.836
also has influence,to some degrees
on the vigor and life-span of
these two kinds of spermatozoa

415
00:30:12.878 --> 00:30:15.676
For example,when the ovum is
in the waiting condition

416
00:30:15.747 --> 00:30:18.614
if the spermatozoon with
chromosome XY reaches first

417
00:30:18.650 --> 00:30:20.515
then the woman is likely to have a boy

418
00:30:20.786 --> 00:30:22.777
On the contrary,if the spermatozoa
are in the state of waiting

419
00:30:22.854 --> 00:30:25.914
owning to the comparatively long life-span
of the spermatozoon with chromosome XX

420
00:30:25.957 --> 00:30:28.585
then it is quite possible to have a girl

421
00:30:28.627 --> 00:30:30.595
Huang Xiaolin,then you are XY.Right

422
00:30:30.629 --> 00:30:31.459
Yes

423
00:30:32.297 --> 00:30:33.628
So are you

424
00:30:34.599 --> 00:30:37.261
Therefore,the time of ovulation
is very important

425
00:30:37.536 --> 00:30:41.131
It also can be said that the time
of insemination is more critical

426
00:30:43.909 --> 00:30:45.001
I do not fear

427
00:30:45.043 --> 00:30:46.533
Twill get divorced as soon as I leave hospital

428
00:30:46.578 --> 00:30:49.240
She really bit

429
00:30:49.281 --> 00:30:50.543
She really likes her father

430
00:30:52.217 --> 00:30:53.206
Since she conceived

431
00:30:53.251 --> 00:30:54.980
the family members have been keeping
on feeding her like spooning a duck

432
00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:56.681
They wished that she
can become as fat as a pig

433
00:30:57.222 --> 00:30:58.587
As a result,she was too fat
to give birth to the baby

434
00:30:58.623 --> 00:31:00.784
either suffering from dystocia
or massive hemorrhage

435
00:31:01.193 --> 00:31:03.991
Hum,they are making
trouble for themselves

436
00:31:07.265 --> 00:31:09.995
Qingqing,do you feel sick

437
00:31:13.205 --> 00:31:14.695
How dangerous it was just now

438
00:31:19.277 --> 00:31:20.676
In our business

439
00:31:21.513 --> 00:31:23.845
two lives are concerned
when we are in delivery room

440
00:31:24.649 --> 00:31:26.082
We shouldnt be slipshod

441
00:31:28.854 --> 00:31:32.153
Since tomorrow you change all
my shifts to night ones

442
00:31:33.992 --> 00:31:35.584
Don t brood on that thing

443
00:31:35.827 --> 00:31:38.819
In fact,as long as there is nothing
wrong with Lanlans neural system

444
00:31:38.864 --> 00:31:40.354
and mentality

445
00:31:40.399 --> 00:31:42.560
There wont be bad influences on her
marriage and having child in the future

446
00:31:42.934 --> 00:31:47.234
Besides,the young will
not care much for such a thing

447
00:31:48.440 --> 00:31:51.341
I remember that a magazine
has mentioned this problem

448
00:31:52.010 --> 00:31:55.002
Let me see,at whose home I read that?

449
00:31:57.516 --> 00:31:58.983
Hey,Qingqing

450
00:32:03.054 --> 00:32:04.954
Lanlan,why didnt you go home?

451
00:32:05.457 --> 00:32:06.685
Twill go later

452
00:32:20.272 --> 00:32:22.968
Lanlan,what are you going to do

453
00:32:23.708 --> 00:32:24.868
Going home

454
00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:26.400
Did your sister come to receive you

455
00:32:26.445 --> 00:32:27.503
I dont want to wait for her

456
00:32:27.746 --> 00:32:30.044
It is too dangerous to go home by yourself

457
00:32:30.115 --> 00:32:31.275
Let me send you home

458
00:32:31.950 --> 00:32:33.417
It is you who will take risks
if go home by yourself

459
00:32:33.452 --> 00:32:34.350
Why are you following me

460
00:32:34.386 --> 00:32:35.717
Who lets you send me home

461
00:32:37.322 --> 00:32:40.519
What? What a response to my kindness

462
00:32:40.992 --> 00:32:44.792
Lanlan,return the book to Li Changwei,ok

463
00:32:44.830 --> 00:32:45.592
But this book is quite expensive

464
00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:47.325
Also,it is the very book I want to buy

465
00:32:47.365 --> 00:32:49.162
But it is he who gave you the book

466
00:32:49.201 --> 00:32:51.169
My elder brother tells me
not to take others things

467
00:32:54.873 --> 00:32:56.238
Lanlan,sorry,I am late

468
00:32:56.274 --> 00:32:58.572
By the way,this is not the former one

469
00:32:58.610 --> 00:32:59.668
This is the new one that
my elder brother bought recently

470
00:33:00.612 --> 00:33:03.843
That will do very nicely
Wait for me at Li Changweis

471
00:33:03.882 --> 00:33:05.645
Twill go home and have
a talk with him about something

472
00:33:06.251 --> 00:33:07.684
Lanlan

473
00:33:09.154 --> 00:33:12.487
Didnt the business of the bookstalls
outside the door come on very well

474
00:33:13.091 --> 00:33:14.649
Why did they stop doing business

475
00:33:17.796 --> 00:33:19.889
I am about to be a standing committee
of National Peoples Congress

476
00:33:19.931 --> 00:33:22.263
I should do something good in front
of the electorates

477
00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:24.427
They should not have
sold those kinds of books

478
00:33:24.469 --> 00:33:25.902
They are doing harm to the youths minds

479
00:33:26.505 --> 00:33:29.167
Dont worryTrue gold fears no fire

480
00:33:29.207 --> 00:33:31.607
The young men are not mature enough
Thus,their feelings are likely
to get the upper hand

481
00:33:31.643 --> 00:33:32.667
How can I not worry

482
00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:38.281
You may have read at least over
one hundred such kind of books here

483
00:33:38.316 --> 00:33:39.943
But you are still honest and just

484
00:33:40.318 --> 00:33:43.947
So,this kind of books will have
no harm so far as the soul is healthy

485
00:33:44.189 --> 00:33:47.090
If you go on talking nonsense
Twill close down your shop

486
00:33:51.363 --> 00:33:52.523
This

487
00:33:57.235 --> 00:33:58.429
This paper is broken

488
00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:06.377
I know

489
00:34:20.158 --> 00:34:21.284
Do you want it

490
00:34:21.326 --> 00:34:22.657
Let me see

491
00:34:29.334 --> 00:34:30.801
The fashion in 1988

492
00:34:30.835 --> 00:34:34.134
Prevailing over the world through
the thought that being stout
is the most beautiful

493
00:34:36.207 --> 00:34:38.368
This book is quite good,healthy

494
00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.220
You at least can change
four hundreds hair-styles

495
00:34:51.022 --> 00:34:52.387
Take it home and read it at leisure

496
00:34:54.726 --> 00:34:56.091
Mind how you go

497
00:34:57.963 --> 00:34:59.157
Take your time

498
00:35:03.468 --> 00:35:04.935
Lanlan

499
00:35:08.006 --> 00:35:09.837
Didnt the medical doctor join us at play

500
00:35:12.644 --> 00:35:13.804
What is the matter with you

501
00:35:14.079 --> 00:35:16.138
Lao Wuzhi made an apology to everyone

502
00:35:16.715 --> 00:35:17.909
and also gave the stock of soup

503
00:35:20.719 --> 00:35:22.778
In addition,he picked up
over one hundred pictures

504
00:35:23.655 --> 00:35:25.680
and asked Lao Zhao to take
Tao Lanlan to recognize the criminal

505
00:35:25.724 --> 00:35:26.156
Good

506
00:35:26.191 --> 00:35:29.786
But thing like picture is mostly unreliable

507
00:35:30.161 --> 00:35:31.651
Some were taken several years ago

508
00:35:31.696 --> 00:35:34.529
It is also uncertain about the
appearance of the criminal at that time

509
00:35:34.733 --> 00:35:36.963
It is easyTake Tao Lanlan

510
00:35:37.002 --> 00:35:39.698
with us to every work unit
and identify the criminal one by one

511
00:35:39.771 --> 00:35:41.102
That maybe reliable

512
00:35:42.374 --> 00:35:45.400
You are kiddingIs it disgraceful

513
00:35:45.977 --> 00:35:48.571
Lao Zhao,you should make
decisive decision when necessary

514
00:35:50.348 --> 00:35:52.646
When you have a child in
the future,you will know

515
00:35:52.717 --> 00:35:56.244
If I were his father
I would be reluctant to let you take
the child around either

516
00:35:56.287 --> 00:35:58.016
Right Yes,yes,yes

517
00:35:58.056 --> 00:35:59.353
If she were not to go around with us

518
00:35:59.391 --> 00:36:01.757
she could not bring back the suspects

519
00:36:02.260 --> 00:36:04.194
What is to be done if her
parents want to take the child back

520
00:36:04.562 --> 00:36:07.122
I know
How can we just follow their requirement

521
00:36:07.432 --> 00:36:08.490
The headquarters are
urging us to solve the case

522
00:36:08.533 --> 00:36:10.194
If she went
it would be hard to crack the case

523
00:36:10.702 --> 00:36:13.000
I can manage you but not her parents

524
00:36:13.038 --> 00:36:15.336
All will turn out easy to deal
with after the great effort is made

525
00:36:15.573 --> 00:36:18.371
No matter it is easy or not
we have to solve the case

526
00:36:18.410 --> 00:36:21.470
Xiao Liu,you are possessed by
the idea of driving

527
00:36:21.513 --> 00:36:22.775
It seems a bit off base

528
00:36:22.814 --> 00:36:23.542
Why

529
00:36:23.581 --> 00:36:24.479
I have not suspected Lao Zhao

530
00:36:24.516 --> 00:36:25.312
Go away,you

531
00:36:25.350 --> 00:36:28.410
Hey, Lao Zhao,what is your view

532
00:36:28.453 --> 00:36:30.478
On that day,I noticed the marks
left by the tires on the spot

533
00:36:30.955 --> 00:36:33.446
The criminal was only able to escape
after backed the car in three directions

534
00:36:33.825 --> 00:36:35.427
And he discarded the car among the reefs

535
00:36:35.427 --> 00:36:37.327
Besides,he neither pulled the
brake handle nor closed the car door

536
00:36:37.362 --> 00:36:38.852
It seems that he dose not know his goods

537
00:36:39.664 --> 00:36:42.030
Hey,the criminal was committing a crime

538
00:36:42.333 --> 00:36:43.766
Rather than going on business

539
00:36:43.802 --> 00:36:45.531
Since he would leave
the magazine in the car

540
00:36:45.570 --> 00:36:47.162
he also would forget to pull the handbrake

541
00:36:48.073 --> 00:36:49.540
Of course,I can not be sure about my guess

542
00:36:50.041 --> 00:36:52.839
I just have a kind of feeling
that something is wrong

543
00:36:52.877 --> 00:36:55.539
To crack a case is not to feel
but to look for the scope

544
00:36:55.780 --> 00:36:58.010
Not all the people are suspects

545
00:36:58.817 --> 00:37:00.648
At last you have found the scope
of the case you are in charge of

546
00:37:00.685 --> 00:37:02.516
But I have not any clues at all

547
00:37:03.755 --> 00:37:06.383
I am just talking through my hat

548
00:37:06.424 --> 00:37:07.789
You are welcome

549
00:37:07.826 --> 00:37:10.260
Whether you go or not
if he forces you to

550
00:37:10.295 --> 00:37:11.523
Twill go with you

551
00:37:11.563 --> 00:37:12.621
I cant go

552
00:37:12.664 --> 00:37:13.824
I have to turn to that guy

553
00:37:13.865 --> 00:37:14.832
Sister

554
00:37:16.768 --> 00:37:17.700
Lanlan

555
00:37:18.103 --> 00:37:19.695
Why do you stand humming and hawing?

556
00:37:19.738 --> 00:37:20.796
Speak out

557
00:37:20.839 --> 00:37:23.399
I saw that man again

558
00:37:23.441 --> 00:37:24.567
Who?

559
00:37:25.076 --> 00:37:26.976
The man who attacked me in that evening

560
00:37:27.011 --> 00:37:29.502
Where? When

561
00:37:29.948 --> 00:37:32.576
He was there as I came back just now

562
00:37:33.451 --> 00:37:34.679
Where did he go

563
00:37:34.719 --> 00:37:36.482
He left from here

564
00:37:38.590 --> 00:37:40.421
Are you sure

565
00:37:40.458 --> 00:37:42.016
Maybe

566
00:37:44.329 --> 00:37:46.194
Why didnt you tell Li Changwei

567
00:37:46.698 --> 00:37:49.394
I heard that you thought scorn of him

568
00:37:52.070 --> 00:37:54.334
Then why didnt you cry out

569
00:37:54.405 --> 00:37:56.396
I was afraid.

570
00:37:56.441 --> 00:37:59.774
What a fool.Serve you right

571
00:37:59.811 --> 00:38:01.335
Sister

572
00:38:14.826 --> 00:38:19.854
You,come her and sit down

573
00:38:21.132 --> 00:38:24.260
Brother,you lost money again

574
00:38:25.970 --> 00:38:27.562
In that evening when you stole the car

575
00:38:27.605 --> 00:38:29.766
Something happened in Xiao Huang Tang

576
00:38:29.808 --> 00:38:30.900
The police called me

577
00:38:30.942 --> 00:38:33.604
Fortunately,three men testified
that I was playing cards

578
00:38:33.878 --> 00:38:34.640
If not

579
00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:37.580
Brother,one should
answer for what he does

580
00:38:37.615 --> 00:38:39.242
I did it

581
00:38:39.784 --> 00:38:41.479
It is really you who did it

582
00:38:45.557 --> 00:38:48.720
I really doubt whether
you was born by our mother

583
00:38:53.731 --> 00:38:56.529
Why did you take out you anger of losing
money in playing cards on me

584
00:38:58.636 --> 00:39:00.297
Why must you attack that girl

585
00:39:00.338 --> 00:39:02.602
Why must you do such conscienceless thing

586
00:39:03.074 --> 00:39:04.837
What a hell of your mind

587
00:39:04.909 --> 00:39:07.503
You are born to be a fool

588
00:39:10.782 --> 00:39:13.410
You still go out with these clothes

589
00:39:13.451 --> 00:39:15.919
You are really considerate of the policemen

590
00:39:15.954 --> 00:39:17.421
Take them off

591
00:39:17.455 --> 00:39:19.324
Pour gasoline on and burn them out

592
00:39:19.324 --> 00:39:21.189
But brother,this is new

593
00:39:21.226 --> 00:39:22.488
Hold your jaw!

594
00:39:22.527 --> 00:39:26.327
Put these onTake off the shoes
and burn them out together

595
00:39:30.201 --> 00:39:36.140
I have painstakingly brought up
such a son of a bitch

596
00:39:36.941 --> 00:39:40.240
Brother,didnt you say that it
was not good to gamble but whore

597
00:39:40.278 --> 00:39:41.802
Itold a lie

598
00:39:42.046 --> 00:39:43.809
Twill get anger if you go on hitting me

599
00:39:47.685 --> 00:39:49.084
The man is still around here

600
00:39:49.954 --> 00:39:51.353
Then it is more dangerous

601
00:39:53.258 --> 00:39:56.785
You should go to Shanghai
with your mom in a few days
to keep clear of that fellow

602
00:39:56.828 --> 00:39:58.090
Until the criminal is arrested

603
00:39:58.129 --> 00:39:59.221
you can come back

604
00:39:59.797 --> 00:40:00.991
Right

605
00:40:01.866 --> 00:40:04.892
You can write to me if someone teases you

606
00:40:04.936 --> 00:40:07.461
Or you also can write your uncle

607
00:40:07.538 --> 00:40:09.165
Say nothing of her who is just a child

608
00:40:09.207 --> 00:40:12.574
We will be also afraid
of seeing the criminal

609
00:40:13.311 --> 00:40:15.905
I once saw in broad daylight

610
00:40:15.947 --> 00:40:17.676
a man thrusting the busman with a knife

611
00:40:17.715 --> 00:40:19.376
People around didnt dare to speak

612
00:40:20.685 --> 00:40:24.451
Dont fight with other students at school

613
00:40:24.822 --> 00:40:26.346
Just pay all your attention on study

614
00:40:27.592 --> 00:40:32.086
If trouble comes,there is no way

615
00:40:32.530 --> 00:40:35.522
Everyday when come home after school
First study

616
00:40:36.267 --> 00:40:39.600
I think none but when
she grows up in the future

617
00:40:39.637 --> 00:40:42.162
and marries,she will get to understand

618
00:40:44.208 --> 00:40:48.770
Man,if he cant forget something
he will be unable to keep alive

619
00:40:49.514 --> 00:40:53.416
Suppose that I could forget
what happened on Lanlan
I would not be a human

620
00:40:53.451 --> 00:40:54.713
Fine

621
00:40:55.086 --> 00:40:56.781
It is the polices job to capture the criminal

622
00:40:56.821 --> 00:40:58.652
It is none of your business
Dont forget to add clothes

623
00:40:59.157 --> 00:41:00.647
Did the police give birth to Lanlan

624
00:41:00.692 --> 00:41:02.057
Was she brought up by the police

625
00:41:06.431 --> 00:41:09.025
All right,all right
Dont let Lanlan hear

626
00:41:09.934 --> 00:41:11.834
Lanlan,say goodbye to me

627
00:41:22.380 --> 00:41:23.347
Qingqing

628
00:41:24.015 --> 00:41:26.779
Dont get on,the car starts
Qingqing,the car is about to start

629
00:41:36.461 --> 00:41:39.157
Lanlan,Qingqing

630
00:41:41.232 --> 00:41:43.166
Qingqing,Qingqing

631
00:41:55.446 --> 00:41:56.743
Hurry up, Lao Tao

632
00:41:56.781 --> 00:41:58.442
Qingqing has whipped Lanlan off

633
00:41:58.483 --> 00:42:00.917
Why didnt you stop her

634
00:42:00.952 --> 00:42:02.977
She got up and then whipped her off

635
00:42:03.021 --> 00:42:04.989
Be quick,be quick
Train attendant

636
00:42:05.023 --> 00:42:08.686
Would you please look after the luggage
of the upper and lower berth of No.7

637
00:42:08.726 --> 00:42:09.556
Thank you,thank you

638
00:42:09.961 --> 00:42:11.986
The luggages are two things,under this

639
00:42:12.030 --> 00:42:13.292
Two pieces,please

640
00:42:28.312 --> 00:42:30.712
You have been willful from a baby

641
00:42:30.748 --> 00:42:33.046
Be quiet. Lanlan is sleeping
Your mother and I

642
00:42:35.153 --> 00:42:38.520
Qingqing,in that year you drove us away

643
00:42:38.556 --> 00:42:41.218
wanting to stayed and lived by
yourself with your little sister

644
00:42:41.259 --> 00:42:42.954
You made a tremendous fuss about it

645
00:42:42.994 --> 00:42:44.484
We finally had to yield

646
00:42:44.529 --> 00:42:46.656
Besides,we felt rather guilty

647
00:42:46.697 --> 00:42:48.028
Thus we granted your request

648
00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:52.763
Actually,if you had not made such
a fuss by following your temper

649
00:42:52.804 --> 00:42:53.862
it would have not

650
00:42:53.905 --> 00:42:55.167
Why are you mentioning that

651
00:43:01.913 --> 00:43:04.143
I had thyroid
hyperparathyroidism in that year

652
00:43:04.182 --> 00:43:07.015
Lanlan and you went to
hospital and sent me dishes

653
00:43:07.051 --> 00:43:08.245
and accompanied me

654
00:43:09.353 --> 00:43:12.254
Your father was busy

655
00:43:15.393 --> 00:43:17.418
Fine,please dont mention any more

656
00:43:17.495 --> 00:43:20.658
I cannot bear any other pain any longer

657
00:43:20.698 --> 00:43:22.996
Your present state is also not very good

658
00:43:23.034 --> 00:43:25.264
It would be better to let Lanlan go with us

659
00:43:25.570 --> 00:43:27.435
And Twill manage to

660
00:43:27.472 --> 00:43:28.962
move you to Shanghai

661
00:43:29.006 --> 00:43:31.201
I can find a good school for Lanlan

662
00:43:31.676 --> 00:43:32.973
Please let Lanlan go with us

663
00:43:33.244 --> 00:43:35.269
She then can study in Beijing

664
00:43:35.313 --> 00:43:37.247
Why dont you ask for Lanlans opinion

665
00:43:37.281 --> 00:43:40.011
She is too young to know

666
00:43:40.051 --> 00:43:41.348
Is she is reluctant to

667
00:43:41.686 --> 00:43:43.483
It is not up to her

668
00:43:44.355 --> 00:43:46.448
What if your wife bullies her

669
00:43:46.958 --> 00:43:48.687
Your words are more and more nonsense

670
00:43:49.594 --> 00:43:51.494
What if your man teases her

671
00:43:51.963 --> 00:43:53.430
How can Lanlan hold
her head high in the future

672
00:43:53.798 --> 00:43:55.891
Can she lose her face

673
00:43:56.334 --> 00:43:58.029
Reputation can kill man

674
00:43:58.069 --> 00:43:59.969
You still know reputation

675
00:44:00.004 --> 00:44:03.064
I ask Lanlan to live with me just in
hope of offering her a good environment

676
00:44:03.107 --> 00:44:04.335
What a hell of good environment

677
00:44:05.476 --> 00:44:07.808
Lanlan and I have suffered
a lot since we lived with you

678
00:44:08.513 --> 00:44:10.242
Whenever you quarreled you threw things

679
00:44:10.448 --> 00:44:12.575
You hit each other villainously

680
00:44:13.184 --> 00:44:14.811
I was too frightened to cry

681
00:44:14.852 --> 00:44:16.581
and shivered in the sheet

682
00:44:16.854 --> 00:44:18.446
I really wished to die

683
00:44:18.489 --> 00:44:20.116
Do you know

684
00:44:21.826 --> 00:44:25.523
I felt that I was
a bane as soon as your face fell

685
00:44:25.563 --> 00:44:27.588
I was too nervous to breathe

686
00:44:27.632 --> 00:44:29.793
You just left away
as you finished your quarrel

687
00:44:29.834 --> 00:44:31.825
Lanlan and I had nothing to eat but biscuit

688
00:44:31.869 --> 00:44:33.530
and drank the cool water from the tap

689
00:44:33.771 --> 00:44:35.295
You had made tremendous fuss
about divorcing for five years

690
00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:38.065
Lanlan and I also
had suffered a lot for five years

691
00:44:38.543 --> 00:44:40.067
You never thought

692
00:44:40.645 --> 00:44:42.272
Who led to this

693
00:44:42.880 --> 00:44:43.869
Whom to blame

694
00:44:43.948 --> 00:44:45.245
Whom do you think to blame

695
00:44:45.283 --> 00:44:46.545
You go to askyour mother

696
00:44:46.584 --> 00:44:48.017
She knows better than any one else

697
00:44:48.052 --> 00:44:49.610
It is I who I want to ask

698
00:44:49.654 --> 00:44:50.916
Dont you feel sorry for the child

699
00:44:50.955 --> 00:44:52.718
If every member got along
with each other well

700
00:44:52.757 --> 00:44:54.384
the child would not become like this

701
00:44:54.425 --> 00:44:56.620
It is I who caused the terrible
state that the child is in

702
00:44:56.661 --> 00:44:58.288
It is you who asked for a divorce

703
00:44:58.329 --> 00:44:59.921
Ok,ok

704
00:44:59.964 --> 00:45:02.159
Today you should make everything
clear in front of Qingqing

705
00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:04.225
Tell her the reason why I asked for a divorce

706
00:45:04.268 --> 00:45:07.032
Do you dare to say
Get out of hereGo put to quarrel

707
00:45:07.271 --> 00:45:08.533
You are more unreasonable
than your mother

708
00:45:09.507 --> 00:45:12.635
Both of you should leave,Go

709
00:45:32.964 --> 00:45:34.022
Ah

710
00:45:47.845 --> 00:45:49.176
Coming,coming

711
00:45:58.623 --> 00:46:00.784
Books are coming
Put up the bookstall first

712
00:46:03.527 --> 00:46:05.927
I am about to become the committee
of the Political Association

713
00:46:07.164 --> 00:46:08.722
For being able to buy those books

714
00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:10.934
I am not kidding It is true

715
00:46:11.402 --> 00:46:12.994
What about your parents

716
00:46:13.804 --> 00:46:15.294
They has achieved their goal

717
00:46:15.339 --> 00:46:16.499
They can go wherever they like

718
00:46:16.841 --> 00:46:18.274
Lanlan has been on summer holiday

719
00:46:18.309 --> 00:46:19.469
From today,I want her to

720
00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:21.205
come here every day.Ok

721
00:46:24.849 --> 00:46:26.441
Wait for the criminal

722
00:46:29.053 --> 00:46:30.520
Catch,catch.Lower a little

723
00:46:30.588 --> 00:46:32.385
Ok Is it all right

724
00:46:38.562 --> 00:46:40.894

I can manage by myself

728
00:46:52.243 --> 00:46:53.710
All right

729
00:46:55.946 --> 00:46:56.970
Here you are

00:47:05.423 --> 00:47:07.152
Brother,come here foe a moment

731
00:47:12.863 --> 00:47:14.455
Brother, do you find out that

732
00:47:14.498 --> 00:47:16.659
Qingqings sight fishy

733
00:47:16.701 --> 00:47:19.397
For she is busy wither at work or off duty

734
00:47:19.670 --> 00:47:20.967
I know you like Qingqing.

735
00:47:21.005 --> 00:47:22.267
She is also my old classmate

736
00:47:22.306 --> 00:47:24.001
Now I begin to worry about her as well

737
00:47:25.142 --> 00:47:26.541
She was born with such a temper

738
00:47:26.610 --> 00:47:28.339
Her temper is quite fun

739
00:47:28.379 --> 00:47:29.573
Bah

740
00:47:29.613 --> 00:47:31.308
Suppose that you and she
fall in love with each other

741
00:47:31.349 --> 00:47:34.716
you are damned to suffer
if she gets obstinate

742
00:47:34.752 --> 00:47:36.413
Xiao Wei,lend me the hammer for a while

743
00:47:38.389 --> 00:47:39.754
Here you are

744
00:47:46.097 --> 00:47:47.530
If I were to be imprisoned,

745
00:47:47.565 --> 00:47:50.500
she then would wait for me in
all her life as she is obstinate

746
00:47:50.534 --> 00:47:52.161
You care nothing

747
00:47:52.203 --> 00:47:54.000
Why are you obsessed with her

748
00:47:54.839 --> 00:47:57.330
You have on idea that I am also obstinate

749
00:48:07.685 --> 00:48:09.676
The analytical
points of No.9 are quite similar

750
00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:11.585
This

751
00:48:11.856 --> 00:48:14.154
So are those of No.12

752
00:48:14.191 --> 00:48:17.251
The upshot of No.3 is that that figure
prints on the spot can not show

753
00:48:17.294 --> 00:48:19.091
It is difficult to identify

754
00:48:19.130 --> 00:48:21.598
Xiao Liu,please sign your name here

755
00:48:21.632 --> 00:48:23.122
I am asking our group leader to sign

756
00:48:24.001 --> 00:48:25.662
Party members self-assessment

757
00:48:28.639 --> 00:48:30.163
This

758
00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:34.473
is the application for housing

759
00:48:35.146 --> 00:48:36.670
It is useless to have my signature on

760
00:48:36.714 --> 00:48:38.238
You sign your name first
then it will turn to the section chief

761
00:48:38.282 --> 00:48:39.943
Then it will go to
the chief of the department

762
00:48:39.984 --> 00:48:41.884
After the chief of the department signs
his name,I should hand it out to the
administrative department for research

763
00:48:42.086 --> 00:48:44.179
Finally I have to ask for
deputy director generals signature

764
00:48:44.455 --> 00:48:46.218
There is hell little use of my signature

765
00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:47.957
It will be the same though
you sign ten thousand your names

766
00:48:47.992 --> 00:48:51.450
Bring other suspects data
And this,my retirement report

767
00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:01.665
Is it the case of Tao Lanlan

768
00:49:02.606 --> 00:49:03.903
It is the case of robbing guns

769
00:49:04.842 --> 00:49:05.831
Here you are

770
00:49:08.245 --> 00:49:09.337
Thank you

771
00:49:09.613 --> 00:49:10.910
Hey, Lao Zhao

772
00:49:11.515 --> 00:49:14.712
You set me a tricky problem in front
of the chief of the department that day

773
00:49:15.186 --> 00:49:16.778
What is your theory

774
00:49:17.021 --> 00:49:18.010
I have no theory

775
00:49:18.055 --> 00:49:19.682
I just thought about it

776
00:49:20.024 --> 00:49:21.286
I seemed to have a kind of feeling

777
00:49:21.358 --> 00:49:23.121
Our job is involving human life

778
00:49:23.160 --> 00:49:24.320
We cant just follow our feelings

779
00:49:24.595 --> 00:49:26.586
Do you know
Han Fuju in Shandong province

780
00:49:27.198 --> 00:49:29.689
Everyone knows him.He was a warlord

781
00:49:30.201 --> 00:49:32.032
He solved cases
through following his feeling

782
00:49:32.069 --> 00:49:33.832
He brought the suspects in front of him

783
00:49:33.871 --> 00:49:36.203
Those who had good facial features
can be released

784
00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:38.902
While those had bad ones would be killed

785
00:49:43.414 --> 00:49:44.813
You mean I become the warlord

786
00:49:44.849 --> 00:49:46.146
If I were Han Fuju

787
00:49:46.183 --> 00:49:47.844
all of your facial features
would be considered bad

788
00:49:48.152 --> 00:49:49.517
Hey, Lao Zhao

789
00:49:49.854 --> 00:49:52.254
You can go to the universities for old age

790
00:49:52.490 --> 00:49:55.152
Really Universities for old age
It is quite good

791
00:49:55.192 --> 00:49:57.752
In the celebration,we will send
flowers to you and fire firecracker

792
00:49:58.496 --> 00:50:01.795
Wear flowers and fire firecracker?
Are you going to sweep me out

793
00:50:04.902 --> 00:50:08.269
You neednt care about the aperture
and focus of this camera

794
00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:11.834
Just keep about one-meter distance

795
00:50:12.443 --> 00:50:15.571
And dont shake the hands
when press the shutterThat would be fine

796
00:50:17.448 --> 00:50:18.437
Have a try

797
00:50:20.584 --> 00:50:23.553
You are too close

798
00:50:23.587 --> 00:50:24.576
The face will be distorting in
the picture if you are too close

799
00:50:24.622 --> 00:50:25.919
Is that fine

800
00:50:29.326 --> 00:50:30.293
What is it used for

801
00:50:30.761 --> 00:50:32.126
Do not press that

802
00:50:32.162 --> 00:50:33.720
The rear cover will open once you press it

803
00:50:33.764 --> 00:50:35.163
Why are you absent-minded

804
00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:37.595
What did I tell you to do

805
00:50:46.043 --> 00:50:47.340
Is the distance proper

806
00:50:48.445 --> 00:50:50.003
Do as you see fit

807
00:51:35.593 --> 00:51:36.787
What time is it now,master

808
00:51:36.827 --> 00:51:38.021
A quarter past seven

809
00:51:41.732 --> 00:51:42.926
Thank you

810
00:51:49.540 --> 00:51:50.666
What is up

811
00:51:52.543 --> 00:51:53.874
You

812
00:52:07.091 --> 00:52:08.991
Get on

813
00:52:11.762 --> 00:52:15.596
Master Sorry

814
00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:28.645
Ninety-seven,ninety-eight
ninety-nine,one hundred

815
00:52:28.679 --> 00:52:29.941
Ok,sleep

816
00:52:29.980 --> 00:52:31.845
Wait for a moment

817
00:52:36.553 --> 00:52:37.485
Who is it

818
00:52:38.022 --> 00:52:40.081
It is me.Qingqing

819
00:52:44.128 --> 00:52:45.220
Howls everything going

820
00:52:50.434 --> 00:52:51.264
See by yourself

821
00:52:51.301 --> 00:52:52.768
Lanlan is about to go out

822
00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:01.104
Why is me

823
00:53:01.478 --> 00:53:02.672
Take it

824
00:53:06.617 --> 00:53:07.845
What is wrong

825
00:53:07.918 --> 00:53:09.442
You didnt be taken

826
00:53:10.788 --> 00:53:14.485
Look,only the one I tookwhen I tried

827
00:53:17.695 --> 00:53:19.526
They said that you are beautiful

828
00:53:19.797 --> 00:53:22.231
They are prepared to paste it
on shop window for advertising

829
00:53:22.966 --> 00:53:24.558
What damn are you laughing at

830
00:53:28.105 --> 00:53:29.367
Din you say that everything was done

831
00:53:29.406 --> 00:53:30.703
Just press the bottom

832
00:53:34.645 --> 00:53:36.112
It had no power,didnt it

833
00:53:36.580 --> 00:53:38.138
I put it a new battery

834
00:53:38.749 --> 00:53:39.875
What about the camera

835
00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:54.327
Did you open this

836
00:53:54.898 --> 00:53:56.832
I have seen all the people on the film

837
00:54:00.904 --> 00:54:03.998
You can be the top news in 1988

838
00:54:24.428 --> 00:54:26.453
Girl will become not nice when frown

839
00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:32.792
Finally it is still the girls who are
at a disadvantage situation

840
00:54:43.547 --> 00:54:46.209
The words like those
written in the old novels

841
00:54:47.985 --> 00:54:49.384
I work in gynecology and obstetrics

842
00:55:12.009 --> 00:55:14.443
It is foolish to persuade people

843
00:55:16.180 --> 00:55:19.013
I am a fool now

844
00:55:22.753 --> 00:55:26.120
People in three kinds of jobs have
the deepest understanding of human being

845
00:55:26.657 --> 00:55:30.149
They are gynecology and obstetrics
court and funeral home

846
00:55:30.627 --> 00:55:33.790
You should understand
what human being is

847
00:55:34.965 --> 00:55:36.557
Human is always born out

848
00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:38.295
Grows up

849
00:55:38.335 --> 00:55:40.769
Get old and die
What are leading up to

850
00:55:43.807 --> 00:55:49.211
Qingqing,you go too far on something

851
00:55:51.048 --> 00:55:52.606
If your sister were

852
00:55:52.649 --> 00:55:54.844
What you were me,what would you do

853
00:55:55.819 --> 00:55:59.311
At least I would not add burden to her

854
00:56:00.891 --> 00:56:04.224
I do know you fear to bear burdens

855
00:56:13.070 --> 00:56:14.901
Lend me the camera one more

856
00:56:14.938 --> 00:56:16.132
I have known how to use it

857
00:56:32.356 --> 00:56:38.955
Hey,nothing

858
00:56:42.299 --> 00:56:43.664
Have a sleep

859
00:56:44.735 --> 00:56:47.761
You can sleep for an hour

860
00:57:35.352 --> 00:57:38.014
Especially after committee emotional crime

861
00:57:38.288 --> 00:57:40.415
criminal will hide his criminality

862
00:57:40.991 --> 00:57:42.959
by managing to destroy evidences

863
00:57:43.226 --> 00:57:46.662
He will be afraid of the
witness or the polices track

864
00:57:46.697 --> 00:57:49.291
or the revenge from the victims
and their relatives

865
00:57:49.566 --> 00:57:52.034
Chief of the department
please sign your name on
They may behave unusually

866
00:57:52.436 --> 00:57:54.563
Even the new motive
for crime may come into being

867
00:57:54.805 --> 00:57:57.069
Due to either the fear of being found

868
00:57:57.741 --> 00:58:00.710
or the interest of the outcome
of the crime he committed

869
00:58:01.144 --> 00:58:03.874
he will become sensitive to things around

870
00:58:04.448 --> 00:58:07.576
Criminal might also be attached
to the scene of the crime

871
00:58:07.617 --> 00:58:08.879
or be very concerned
about the circumstance of the victim

872
00:58:08.919 --> 00:58:11.683
Twill spare the time for
a visit to the deputy director general
about your houseThere is no problem

873
00:58:11.755 --> 00:58:14.519
Thank you
In order to fulfill the need of
assaulting instinct or emotion

874
00:58:15.359 --> 00:58:16.917
Also on the contrary

875
00:58:17.160 --> 00:58:21.062
Some criminals always feel that
some evidences might be left on the scene
of the crime.Lao Zhao,set off

876
00:58:21.098 --> 00:58:23.191
Thus they keep alarm all the time

877
00:58:47.758 --> 00:58:49.089
You are even senior
than the chief of the department

878
00:58:49.126 --> 00:58:50.889
It is necessary promote you
before you retire

879
00:58:51.161 --> 00:58:53.254
I am not senior but old

880
00:58:53.296 --> 00:58:54.627
I heard that when you were young

881
00:58:54.664 --> 00:58:56.222
you were famous for your detectivism

882
00:58:56.266 --> 00:58:57.665
Why did you later give up the job

883
00:58:57.701 --> 00:58:58.895
I did not want to give it up

884
00:58:58.935 --> 00:59:00.095
But I was unable to do the job

885
00:59:00.337 --> 00:59:01.304
How could it be possible

886
00:59:01.338 --> 00:59:03.363
A policeman should be just and impartial
even the criminal is his father

887
00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:07.139
At that time people arrested are
all intellectuals like your father

888
00:59:07.177 --> 00:59:09.145
If all of them had been caught
you would have not been born

889
00:59:09.613 --> 00:59:10.807
If you continue to working

890
00:59:10.847 --> 00:59:12.314
even the chief of the department
may become too young

891
00:59:12.382 --> 00:59:14.680
We who have not that ability
can just work with vehicles

892
00:59:17.354 --> 00:59:19.219
There is light on the tower

893
00:59:19.256 --> 00:59:21.588
That is the scene of the Tao Lanlans case

894
00:59:21.625 --> 00:59:23.183
I have also seen that

895
00:59:23.593 --> 00:59:25.356
Will there be any connection

896
00:59:30.267 --> 00:59:32.531
Lao Zhao

897
00:59:32.569 --> 00:59:34.434
The angle of incidence is
as big as the one of reflection

898
00:59:34.838 --> 00:59:35.634
Dont laugh

899
00:59:35.672 --> 00:59:38.072
Did you check the garage in that tower

900
00:59:38.809 --> 00:59:39.776
Df course

901
00:59:39.810 --> 00:59:41.710
Did you check carefully

902
00:59:41.745 --> 00:59:44.771
Sun Dasheng is the boss of that garage

903
00:59:44.815 --> 00:59:46.646
He was once in prison for fighting

904
00:59:46.683 --> 00:59:49.049
He had an alibi
He went gambling again at that night

905
00:59:49.086 --> 00:59:50.747
Do you think this
boy will change to be good

906
00:59:53.256 --> 00:59:54.723
He has made a mistake

907
00:59:55.926 --> 00:59:57.518
Even a good man would make mistakes

908
01:00:04.968 --> 01:00:08.460
Let go

909
01:00:08.505 --> 01:00:09.529
Leave the film

910
01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:11.129
Wait for me

911
01:00:12.109 --> 01:00:13.974
Jam ajournalist with reporting right

912
01:00:14.010 --> 01:00:15.034
Why were you afraid of taking picture

913
01:00:15.078 --> 01:00:16.545
If you were ajournalist

914
01:00:16.580 --> 01:00:17.842
then I could be a policeman

915
01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:45.632
I just praised you at the meeting
of individual businessmen

916
01:00:45.675 --> 01:00:48.007
Why did you set up the bookstall again

917
01:00:50.547 --> 01:00:52.674
I have quit the position of being
a standing committee of NPC

918
01:00:52.716 --> 01:00:54.741
and committee of the Political Association

919
01:00:54.784 --> 01:00:57.776
I cant manage
I need to support my family

920
01:00:57.821 --> 01:00:59.686
You such a fox show your tail again

921
01:01:00.790 --> 01:01:02.280
People are remonstrating against you

922
01:01:02.359 --> 01:01:05.487
They said that students were led
off by you such kind of people

923
01:01:06.129 --> 01:01:09.155
They dare not bully anyone except us

924
01:01:09.699 --> 01:01:11.564
What about the Red Guards in the past

925
01:01:11.635 --> 01:01:12.727
Who taught them?

926
01:01:12.769 --> 01:01:13.758
You are just good at refuting

927
01:01:13.803 --> 01:01:15.998
Books you sell on your
bookstall are not good ones

928
01:01:16.206 --> 01:01:17.537
Of low level

929
01:01:21.378 --> 01:01:24.176
I have good ones full in my house

930
01:01:24.214 --> 01:01:25.442
Shakespeare complete works

931
01:01:25.482 --> 01:01:27.746
Would you like
to buy Guo Moruos anthology

932
01:01:28.652 --> 01:01:31.052
Pig is omnivorous,Sheep eats grass

933
01:01:31.087 --> 01:01:32.577
Everyone has their own kinds of stuff

934
01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:35.258
Like Zola and Suva.

935
01:01:35.292 --> 01:01:36.987
Howls the Steel smelted

936
01:01:37.027 --> 01:01:38.426
Why dont you buy

937
01:01:39.429 --> 01:01:42.057
Please tell me
the publishing company of this

938
01:01:42.098 --> 01:01:45.864
Hey,how much does one cost

939
01:01:45.902 --> 01:01:48.029
People have been corrupted by
the money-oriented spirit
1.5yuan

940
01:01:48.505 --> 01:01:50.632
This book is dirty and broken
You should give me a discount

941
01:01:51.074 --> 01:01:51.972
Ok,ok

942
01:01:54.945 --> 01:01:57.675
There are a few good books by chance

943
01:01:58.215 --> 01:02:00.410
You can take your time and pick

944
01:02:12.829 --> 01:02:16.663
Lanlan,let us make an agreement Ok

945
01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:21.837
Dont read such kind of book

946
01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:24.601
Focus your attention on study

947
01:02:25.275 --> 01:02:26.469
Ok

948
01:02:27.310 --> 01:02:30.040
If you want to read
read the ones in this room

949
01:02:30.313 --> 01:02:33.339
Dont read those outside

950
01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:37.344
You dont apposeThat means you agree

951
01:02:37.387 --> 01:02:40.151
Deal

952
01:02:47.297 --> 01:02:49.629
If you are tired,go into room for a rest

953
01:02:51.701 --> 01:02:54.169
Dont be afraid.I will not tell Qingqing

954
01:02:54.204 --> 01:02:56.138
Li Xhangwei

955
01:02:56.172 --> 01:02:57.969
Hey,I am coming

956
01:03:07.050 --> 01:03:08.312
Look quite beautiful

957
01:03:08.351 --> 01:03:11.548
It is useless.I felt sleepy

958
01:03:11.588 --> 01:03:12.555
What is the bed number

959
01:03:12.589 --> 01:03:13.851
No.73

960
01:03:13.890 --> 01:03:15.323
They are twins

961
01:03:15.358 --> 01:03:17.519
Her little sister died as she was born

962
01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.585
She was strangulated by the umbilical cord

963
01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:22.731
I am afraid that the elder
sister has slim chance to survive

964
01:03:23.566 --> 01:03:25.591
How poor the woman on No.73

965
01:03:25.669 --> 01:03:26.761
She is not merciful

966
01:03:26.836 --> 01:03:29.396
She didnt want the babies
as she knew that they were girls

967
01:03:29.439 --> 01:03:32.272
She said that give them
to others if they were alive

968
01:03:33.843 --> 01:03:35.606
Hells bells

969
01:03:36.012 --> 01:03:38.606
Qingqng,I heard that
the charge nurse asked director

970
01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:40.275
to move you to ward

971
01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:41.215
Why

972
01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:42.843
She said you were usually late recently

973
01:03:42.886 --> 01:03:45.150
And always forgot things
She worried that accident would happen

974
01:03:46.356 --> 01:03:48.790
She told the dean that I would not go either

975
01:03:49.326 --> 01:03:52.090
Be quiet.Dont tell others
that it is I who told you

976
01:04:49.652 --> 01:04:51.779
Get on.I drive you home

977
01:04:51.821 --> 01:04:53.482
Thankyou.Dont bother about it

978
01:04:56.526 --> 01:04:58.391
Uncle Zhao,dont bother about it

979
01:05:37.000 --> 01:05:38.797
Use it It is new

980
01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:40.960
Thank you.That is too much trouble for you

981
01:05:41.004 --> 01:05:42.232
That is all right

982
01:05:45.708 --> 01:05:46.868
This is the last time

983
01:05:49.245 --> 01:05:50.678
I have been retired

984
01:05:50.980 --> 01:05:53.778
Every one will be off duty after an hour

985
01:05:54.217 --> 01:05:56.344
I have to give back the car before ring out

986
01:05:58.354 --> 01:06:00.754
Look,staff in my work unit gave me this toy

987
01:06:01.591 --> 01:06:03.081
It is for my grandson

988
01:06:05.328 --> 01:06:07.819
You then will be vacancy from then on

989
01:06:09.199 --> 01:06:10.962
Yes,you are right

990
01:06:39.596 --> 01:06:40.688
Bother you last time

991
01:06:40.763 --> 01:06:42.390
Please drive us to Qingqing Book House

992
01:07:09.993 --> 01:07:12.962
If you and your family need to see doctors

993
01:07:13.229 --> 01:07:14.958
Please turn to me

994
01:07:15.365 --> 01:07:16.855
I can let you see
the doctors through backdoor

995
01:07:17.133 --> 01:07:19.226
At least you neednt stand in a line

996
01:08:34.978 --> 01:08:37.606
There is no one care me at all

997
01:08:42.185 --> 01:08:44.176
Havent I bought you something
to eat and drink

998
01:08:44.554 --> 01:08:46.249
Dont you hate me to care you

999
01:08:48.391 --> 01:08:50.825
I saw that woman again

1000
01:08:51.361 --> 01:08:53.591
She took a camera
and took pictures of the drivers

1001
01:08:54.364 --> 01:08:57.094
She must have something with that girl

1002
01:08:57.500 --> 01:08:59.593
If not

1003
01:09:01.404 --> 01:09:04.862
Come here,bugger you

1004
01:09:08.111 --> 01:09:09.237
Since you came here

1005
01:09:09.278 --> 01:09:10.905
Have you driven the cars at the garage

1006
01:09:11.247 --> 01:09:12.441
No

1007
01:09:12.482 --> 01:09:14.950
Do workers here know that you can drive

1008
01:09:15.184 --> 01:09:16.378
They dont know

1009
01:09:17.787 --> 01:09:18.879
Nothing

1010
01:09:18.921 --> 01:09:21.549
The action of that woman shows
that the police are still aimless

1011
01:09:22.358 --> 01:09:25.054
Dont leave here from now on

1012
01:09:25.595 --> 01:09:27.028
Dont talk excessively and unwisely

1013
01:09:27.397 --> 01:09:28.796
Dont go to garage either

1014
01:09:29.732 --> 01:09:32.257
Such kind of case will draw
no attention as the time passes

1015
01:09:32.301 --> 01:09:35.134
Let the dust settle before I send you away

1016
01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:41.601
Dont practice that damn thing

1017
01:09:41.844 --> 01:09:45.678
If you are bored,beat my waist for me

1018
01:10:02.765 --> 01:10:05.859
What about this,How about this

1019
01:10:11.040 --> 01:10:12.530
Dose he look like

1020
01:10:16.179 --> 01:10:17.806
How about this

1021
01:10:24.854 --> 01:10:27.288
Look at this one
Is he looks like Li Zhangwei?

1022
01:10:27.323 --> 01:10:28.312
Yes

1023
01:10:32.562 --> 01:10:34.757
And this

1024
01:10:34.797 --> 01:10:35.957
Yes

1025
01:10:48.211 --> 01:10:51.078
Qingqing,the great effort you made
to practice taking pictures has worked

1026
01:10:53.950 --> 01:10:56.350
It is true; you have made a great progress

1027
01:11:29.986 --> 01:11:31.454
Take it easyThere will be nothing wrong
Let me in

1028
01:11:31.454 --> 01:11:33.122
I want to send something to eat
I am afraid that she is hungry

1029
01:11:33.122 --> 01:11:35.491
Charge nurse,please let me go in and have
a look. No,You had better go back first

1030
01:11:35.491 --> 01:11:37.393
It is no problem
I am afraid that they may make mistakes

1031
01:11:37.393 --> 01:11:40.021
You ask her to take it easy
when giving birth to the baby

1032
01:11:40.062 --> 01:11:42.360
What is the bed number

1033
01:11:51.107 --> 01:11:52.631
Go to sterilize first

1034
01:11:58.581 --> 01:12:03.382
You have a sister and I have a son

1035
01:12:05.721 --> 01:12:12.183
Ah,the pain is killing me
Here,towel

1036
01:12:12.662 --> 01:12:16.962
It is paining me to explode

1037
01:12:16.999 --> 01:12:20.264
It is killing me.No,no,no

1038
01:12:20.303 --> 01:12:23.500
What a damn pain
My heat is about to explode

1039
01:12:24.006 --> 01:12:28.466
My head is about to explode
Drink some water

1040
01:12:28.511 --> 01:12:30.706
It is icy.You will be better after drink it
No

1041
01:12:30.746 --> 01:12:34.978
Let me out for a breath
What is up? What is going on?

1042
01:12:36.919 --> 01:12:40.377
Let me out
Cannot go out

1043
01:12:43.092 --> 01:12:45.526
Da Cheng.Please dont cry,dont cry

1044
01:12:45.561 --> 01:12:50.464
Let me have a walk
Let me have a walk. Let me have a walk

1045
01:12:50.499 --> 01:12:55.835
Let me have a walk. Let me...
Please promise not to go out

1046
01:13:01.544 --> 01:13:04.479
Brother,if there were no genre
of human beings.That would be nice

1047
01:13:08.050 --> 01:13:09.677
It is too good to be true

1048
01:13:10.119 --> 01:13:12.747
It would be wonderful if human could fly

1049
01:13:12.788 --> 01:13:14.722
Man then can damn go
doggoned anywhere as he likes

1050
01:13:14.757 --> 01:13:16.122
No one can find him

1051
01:13:17.493 --> 01:13:18.824
All right

1052
01:13:30.139 --> 01:13:32.539
It usually lasts one to two weeks that
the umbilical cord tangle the neck

1053
01:13:32.608 --> 01:13:34.633
It seldom lasts three weeks

1054
01:13:35.444 --> 01:13:36.877
If Qingqing hadnt slept

1055
01:13:36.913 --> 01:13:39.404
and been examined earlier
it would not have happened

1056
01:13:39.448 --> 01:13:42.508
Qingqing,dont take too much
that medicine. It is not good for you

1057
01:13:43.586 --> 01:13:46.282
The interval of Qingqings examination
conforms to the regulation

1058
01:13:50.326 --> 01:13:51.657
Arrange this medical record

1059
01:13:51.694 --> 01:13:52.820
And verify again

1060
01:14:01.637 --> 01:14:03.468
Who was the nurse on duty

1061
01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:05.807
It was me

1062
01:14:05.841 --> 01:14:07.570
Here you are

1063
01:14:10.246 --> 01:14:11.474
Hit her to death

1064
01:14:12.381 --> 01:14:17.717
What are you doing
Give my grandson back

1065
01:14:17.753 --> 01:14:21.154
I have waited torso a long time

1066
01:14:21.190 --> 01:14:22.885
The condition of my grandson was fine

1067
01:14:22.925 --> 01:14:24.358
It was always fine

1068
01:14:24.427 --> 01:14:26.987
Why turned out wrong when he was born

1069
01:14:28.331 --> 01:14:31.789
Twill not let you get off so easily
What were you doing...

01:14:31.834 --> 01:14:33.096
Twill not let you get away with it

01:14:33.135 --> 01:14:34.500
Twill never
You go out first

1072

Someone was killed

1073
01:14:36.539 --> 01:14:39.007
Someone was killed by staff in hospital

1074
01:14:39.041 --> 01:14:42.408
You led me to losing grandson

1075
01:14:42.445 --> 01:14:46.506
Someone was killed
Mum You go put first

1076
01:14:46.549 --> 01:14:52.715
Calm down,You go put first

1077
01:14:54.924 --> 01:15:01.989
Twill do my damnedest to fight with her

1078
01:15:41.804 --> 01:15:43.203
Lanlan

1079
01:15:48.044 --> 01:15:49.272
Lanlan

1080
01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:55.081
Lanlan,Lanlan

1081
01:16:10.533 --> 01:16:12.558
Lanlan,Lanlan

1082
01:16:12.601 --> 01:16:14.068
Be quiet,be quite

1083
01:16:14.537 --> 01:16:15.936
Is Lanlan still sleeping

1084
01:16:22.778 --> 01:16:24.336
She came here in the evening by herself

1085
01:16:25.047 --> 01:16:26.571
She said that she wanted sleep here

1086
01:16:28.484 --> 01:16:30.679
She didnt listen to me despite
my effort to persuade her

1087
01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:34.314
She refused to be send back either

1088
01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:36.189
Why did she

1089
01:16:37.660 --> 01:16:40.185
said that she was afraid of you

1090
01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:42.559
Why did she fear me

1091
01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:45.533
I didnt ask

1092
01:16:49.872 --> 01:16:51.169
Qingqing

1093
01:16:52.908 --> 01:16:54.671
I beg a favor to you

1094
01:16:58.180 --> 01:17:00.375
Please take Lanlan out and have some fun

1095
01:17:03.252 --> 01:17:04.742
Where

1096
01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:06.512
Wherever will be fine

1097
01:17:06.555 --> 01:17:07.522
As long as let her leave home

1098
01:17:07.556 --> 01:17:08.682
As far as possible

1099
01:17:14.964 --> 01:17:17.831
It would be better if you were Lanlan

1100
01:17:20.569 --> 01:17:21.661
Then you would be afraid of her

1101
01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:26.904
And thus you could come and live here

1102
01:17:32.548 --> 01:17:37.986
You are fishing in troubled waters
Puck you

1103
01:17:57.439 --> 01:18:01.500
Qingqing,lets go out

1104
01:18:03.479 --> 01:18:05.071
Three of us go together

1105
01:18:05.114 --> 01:18:07.014
Set out today
No

1106
01:18:12.721 --> 01:18:14.916
You still need
to take charge of the book house

1107
01:18:16.225 --> 01:18:17.351
Qingqing Book House

1108
01:19:32.201 --> 01:19:33.429
We have to go tonight

1109
01:19:33.702 --> 01:19:34.691
What about the book house

1110
01:19:35.904 --> 01:19:37.735
It doesnt matter to just shut up
the shop for several days

1111
01:19:37.806 --> 01:19:40.707
Brother,you are really determined
to carry on a love affair

1112
01:19:40.743 --> 01:19:42.108
You dont look like her boyfriend

1113
01:19:42.845 --> 01:19:44.073
But her father

1114
01:19:44.113 --> 01:19:45.273
Now then,none of your nonsense

1115
01:19:45.314 --> 01:19:46.781
You first have to see about my business

1116
01:19:46.815 --> 01:19:47.975
After that,you can enlighten me as you like

1117
01:19:48.183 --> 01:19:50.117
I have to wake them out later

1118
01:19:50.152 --> 01:19:52.177
And tidy out things,And

1119
01:19:52.221 --> 01:19:53.654
And dissipate your efforts

1120
01:19:55.591 --> 01:19:57.718
Dont forget to buy a telescope for Lanlan

1121
01:19:57.760 --> 01:19:59.250
She said she liked that

1122
01:20:00.596 --> 01:20:02.086
You mustnt come back in at least five years

1123
01:20:02.398 --> 01:20:05.299
Brother,what if the policemen catch me

1124
01:20:05.868 --> 01:20:07.267
So far as you dont commit crime any longer

1125
01:20:07.303 --> 01:20:08.497
nobody can find you

1126
01:20:08.537 --> 01:20:09.697
It is not a homicide case

1127
01:20:09.738 --> 01:20:10.670
The police force will not order the arrest
of you in the whole country

1128
01:20:11.540 --> 01:20:14.168
Come and hold my leg

1129
01:20:22.151 --> 01:20:24.176
Brother,what is it for

1130
01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:26.387
This is my last sum of money

1131
01:20:28.524 --> 01:20:30.151
I saved it for the fear
that you might make mistakes

1132
01:20:36.465 --> 01:20:39.525
Brother,if you die

1133
01:20:39.768 --> 01:20:41.463
Twill burn money
of the nether world for you

1134
01:20:58.253 --> 01:20:59.515
You have waked out

1135
01:21:03.559 --> 01:21:07.393
I have asked Xiao Qin
to buy train tickets of tonight

1136
01:21:10.299 --> 01:21:11.823

01:21:21.977 --> 01:21:29.816
Qingqing,Lanlan is still inside

1139
01:21:48.937 --> 01:21:51.405
Xiao Liu,take other members to have
the brothers be in control at once

Yes

1144
01:21:55.644 --> 01:21:56.872
You drive a car to collect Lanlan

1145
01:21:56.912 --> 01:21:57.901
Prepare to recognize the
criminal through his side face

1146
01:21:57.946 --> 01:22:00.244
But I dont know where she is
how can I collect her

1147
01:22:06.388 --> 01:22:09.186
Stay here.I am going to withdraw money

1148

Wrap the wound and
send him to hospital swiftly

1156

Youre capable of damned thing

1169
01:26:34.189 --> 01:26:35.417
We have to fling caution to winds now

1170
01:26:35.457 --> 01:26:36.947

01:27:32.814 --> 01:27:33.781
He seems not to be a professional brigand

1178
01:27:33.815 --> 01:27:35.578
We can delude him in many aspects

1179
01:27:35.917 --> 01:27:37.111
Dont rush to action
