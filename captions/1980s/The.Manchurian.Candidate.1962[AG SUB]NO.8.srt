1
00:01:16,643 --> 00:01:18,411
- 是突击检查！
- 才不是呢
- Joint raided!
- No!

2
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,581
这只是我们的Raymond，可爱的Shaw中士
That's just our Raymond,
our lovable Sgt. Shaw.

3
00:01:21,581 --> 00:01:23,549
行了玩够了，咱们走，快走！
All right. Let's go, you men.
Come on.

4
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:27,087
快走！
Let's go.

5
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,386
来吧，中士，Gertrude请你喝啤酒
Come on, Sarge.
Gertrude buy you beer.

6
00:01:31,458 --> 00:01:32,692
这人怎么回事啊？
What's the matter with him?

7
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:36,458
恐怕我们的圣人Raymond，不懂享受人生
I'm afraid our Saint Raymond,
he don't approve.

8
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:41,601
或许他在家有女朋友或者未婚妻什么的
Maybe he's got a girl back home,
or something.

9
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,092
他？Raymond？你开玩笑吧？
Him? Our Raymond?
Are you kidding?

10
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:49,807
- Silvers，这件浴袍怎么样？
- 你说啥？浴袍给我了？快滚
- Silvers, how about the robe?
- What do you mean, my robe? Get out!

11
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,606
情况不妙
Bad here.

12
00:02:19,606 --> 00:02:22,275
- 你怎么知道的？
- Chunjin我就是在前面两英里的地方出生的
- How do you know?
- Chunjin born two miles from here.

13
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:26,546
自从我们来到朝鲜，到过的每个地方你这个傻逼都说自己是在前面两英里处出生的
So far, every place we've been in Korea,
this joker was born two miles from it.

14
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:28,114
情况有多坏？
What's so bad about it?

15
00:02:28,114 --> 00:02:31,651
很复杂，周围全是沼泽，三十码深，下面或许还有流沙
Tricky. Swamp all around.
Thirty yards up, maybe quicksand.

16
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:33,915
没人跟我说过有流沙啊
Nobody said anything about quicksand.

17
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:36,853
我们不能绕着走吗？
Can't we go around it?

18
00:02:37,957 --> 00:02:41,094
- 不行，中士
- 你有什么建议？
- No, Sergeant.
- What's your personal advice?

19
00:02:41,094 --> 00:02:44,264
接下来二百码，咱们排成一排前进
All walk in single line,
next 200 yards.

20
00:02:44,264 --> 00:02:46,366
不行，排成单排行进不符合战术规范
Rejected. Not tactical
to advance in a single line.

21
00:02:46,366 --> 00:02:47,799
那只能沉进流沙里了
Patrol sink.

22
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:51,371
我们绕不过去吗？
Can't we go around it?

23
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:53,439
- 不行，中士
- 不管了
- No, Sergeant.
- Never mind
24
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,872
来吧，传令吧
Okay, pass the word.

25
00:06:06,099 --> 00:06:09,702
“这个国家不会轻易地颁发那枚象征对勇气的最高奖赏的勋章”
“This nation jealously guards its highest award for valor,”

26
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,971
“国会荣耀勋章”
“the Congressional Medal of Honor”

27
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:16,809
“共有572万人参加了朝鲜战争，”
“In the Korean War, with 5,720,000 personnel engaged,”

28
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:19,744
“只有77人有幸被授予这枚勋章”
“only 77 men were so honored.”

29
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:25,818
“这77人之中，就有上士Raymond Shaw”
“One of these 77 men was Staff Sergeant Raymond Shaw.”

30
00:06:25,818 --> 00:06:29,689
“Raymond Shaw离开前线后就直接飞往华盛顿”
“Raymond Shaw was returned from combat and flown to Washington”

31
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:33,593
“亲自接受由美国总统颁发的勋章”

32
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:37,296
“这就是为什么他的出现，或者说任何一位荣耀勋章获得者的出现”
“This is why his presence, or that of any Medal of Honor winner,”

33
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:40,959
“都足以使在场的将军们起立向其敬礼”
“is sufficient to bring generals to their feet, saluting.”

34
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:53,312
恭喜你，孩子，感觉怎么样？
Congratulations, son. How do you feel?

35
00:06:53,312 --> 00:06:56,213
感觉就像《惊奇科学漫画》里的白痴上尉一样
Like Capt. Idiot
in Astounding Science Comics.

36
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,649
等等，将军
Hold it, General.

37
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:01,948
将军，请等等，快点，快过来
Hold it, General, please. Come on.
Get in there quickly.

38
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,586
妈妈，这是什么，你在这儿干嘛？
Mother, what is this?
What are you doing here?

39
00:07:17,804 --> 00:07:21,507
Iselin参议员，作为荣耀奖章获得者的父亲你的感觉如何？
Senator Iselin, how does it feel to be
the father of a Medal of Honor winner?

40
00:07:21,507 --> 00:07:24,977
- 他不是我父亲
- 参议员是Raymond的继父
- He is not my father.
- The Senator is Raymond's stepfather.

41
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:26,879
我只能说，作为...
I can only say that, as one...

42
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:29,816
一个奉献一生服务国家的人...
who has devoted his life
to the service of his country...

43
00:07:29,816 --> 00:07:31,684
这是你设计好的...
You did this...

44
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:34,420
你设计好的，妈妈，你组织了这个令人作呕的马戏团
You did this, Mother. You organized
this disgusting three-ring circus.

45
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:37,723
亲爱的，你可是荣耀奖章的获得者，顺便说一句，恭喜你！
Darling，you're a Medal of Honor winner.
Incidentally, congratulations.

46
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:42,528
我应该写信告诉你的，但最近几个月家里一团乱
I would have written, but we've been
in a frightful mess the last few months.

47
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:45,531
好啦，让他过去！
All right, let him through!

48
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:48,227
够啦够啦，让他过去
That's enough, now.
Let him through.

49
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:52,266
说‘茄子’
Say 'cheese.'

50
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:56,075
行了行了，够啦，让这个可怜人过去吧
All right, that's enough, now.
Let the poor boy through.

51
00:07:56,075 --> 00:07:57,542
行行好让他过去吧
Please, let him through.

52
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,416
你怎么啦儿子？我们已经有够多的事忙了...
What is the matter, Raymond?
We've gone to a lot of trouble to...

53
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,419
- 像是给你安排游行
- 游行？
- Arrange the parade for you.
- The parade?

54
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:10,323
- 把这拿开
- 为什么？你个爱出风头一根筋的傻逼！
- Get that out. 
- Why, you publicity-sick, flag-simple goob!

55
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,859
仅仅是因为你的父母和整个国家...
Just because your parents
and the entire country...

56
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:14,994
- 都为你感到骄傲...
- 骗谁呢，妈妈？
- are proud of you...
- Who's kidding who, Mother?

57
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:19,499
Johnny已经在11月宣布要准备再次竞选了，你自己很清楚的，不是吗？
Johnny's up for re-election in November.
You've got it all figured out, haven't you?

58
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,369
Johnny Iselin的儿子，荣耀奖章的获得者，这会给你拉大约五万票吧？
Johnny Iselin's boy, Medal of Honor winner
That should get you 50,000 votes.

59
00:08:23,369 --> 00:08:26,506
Raymond，我是你妈，你怎么能这么跟我说话？
Raymond, I'm your mother.
How can you talk to me this way?

60
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,874
我自己什么都不想要
I want nothing for myself.

61
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:31,544
我的一生都致力于帮助你和Johnny
My entire life is devoted
to helping you and to helping Johnny.

62
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:34,480
- 我的男子汉们，我的两个小男孩
- 妈，别说了

- Mother, stop it.

63
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,681

这是“支持Iselin公民委员会”送给他的生日礼物
A gift from the Citizens For Iselin
Committee for his last birthday.

76
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,628
在竞选期间它确实救了我们，你知道吗
It absolutely saved our lives during the campaign，you see.

77
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:24,823
这个拉出来是双人床
This opens up into a double bed.

78
00:09:29,101 --> 00:09:30,762

还有什么能消除竞选的痛苦呢？嗯？
Anything to take the pain
out of campaigning, eh?

81
00:09:39,045 --> 00:09:41,036
我经常这么说
That's what I always say.

82
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:47,086
- 妈，我现在能把军服脱了吗？
- Raymond，你到底怎么了？
- May I take this thing off now, Mother?

83
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:50,289
你看起来就像头疼的要炸了
You look as if your head were going
to come to a point in seconds.

00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:53,359
Johnny，给他杯喝的或者别的什么，坐下，Raymond，放松

about Johnny...

I must ask you to forgive their
somewhat lackadaisical manners...

129
00:13:05,117 --> 00:13:08,287
因为我已经调教过他们了，或者说把他们洗过脑了，
but I have conditioned them,
or 'brainwashed' them...

130
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:11,123
我知道这是个新的单词，

00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:39,485
是的，太太
Yes, ma'am.

138
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:44,582
‘抽起来不错，有烟该有的味儿’
‘Tastes good, like a cigarette should.'

139
00:13:46,926 --> 00:13:48,394
现在，同志们...
Now then, comrades...

140
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:51,363
请让我介绍著名的Raymond Shaw
may I present
the famous Raymond Shaw...

141
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:57,469
你们飞了8万英里来到满洲里这个沉闷的地方就是为了来看他的
the young man you've flown 80,000 miles
to this dreary spot in Manchuria to see.

142
00:13:57,469 --> 00:14:00,438
Raymond，请你坐到我这边
Raymond, pull your chair over here
by me, please.

143
00:14:03,142 --> 00:14:06,345
我相信你们都听过那个无稽之谈...
I am sure you've all heard
the old wives' tale...

144
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,814
被催眠的对象即使在外界的强迫下...
that no hypnotized
subject may be forced...

145
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:13,919
也不会做出违背自己道德标准的事，无论什么条件下
to do that which is repellent to his
moral nature, whatever that may be.

146
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,788
当然，这是胡说
Nonsense, of course.

147
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:21,126
你们做记录的记下来这些，记得要参考Brenman的论文
You note-takers might set down
a reminder to consult Brenman's paper.

148
00:14:21,126 --> 00:14:26,465
对反社会和自我伤害催眠对象的实验
Experiments in the Hypnotic Production of Antisocial and Self-Injurious Behavior

149
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:30,402
或者Wells 1941年的论文，我觉得是叫...
Or Wells' 1941 paper which was titled,
I believe...

150
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:34,273
对有前科催眠对象的实验
Experiments in the Hypnotic Production of Crime.

151
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:37,076
还有，当然，Andrew Salter那本非凡著作，
Or, of course, Andrew Salter's
remarkable book...

152
00:14:37,076 --> 00:14:39,812
条件反射疗法
Conditioned Reflex Therapy

153
00:14:39,812 --> 00:14:42,147
名字就仨字
to name only three.

154
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,683
如果你觉得只有西方世界...
Or if it offends you
that only the West is working...

155
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:47,820
在制造更多的犯罪和针对现代社会缺陷的罪犯...
to manufacture more crime
and better criminals...

156
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,456
这观点令你觉得不悦...
against the modern shortages...

157
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:52,258
我推荐 Krasnogorski的
I suggest Krasnogorski's...

158
00:14:52,258 --> 00:14:54,760
主要暴力动机...
Primary violence Motivation...

159
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:59,265
或者Serov的 对自我毁灭的片面建议
or Serov's The Unilateral Suggestion
to Self-Destruction.

160
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:05,037
亲爱的Yen先生，你越来越老，也越来越嗦了
My dear Yen, as you grow older,
you grow more long-winded.

161
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:07,373
你不能赶紧说重点吗？
Can't we get to the point?

162
00:15:07,373 --> 00:15:09,875
这个男人杀过人吗？
Has the man ever killed anyone?

163
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,343
或者没杀过？
Or has he not?

164
00:15:11,343 --> 00:15:14,280
亲爱的Dimitri，我很抱歉
I apologize, my dear Dimitri.

165
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:19,616
我老是忘了你是农民并且注意力有限
I keep forgetting that you're a young
country and your attention span is limited.

166
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:24,490
告诉我，Raymond，你杀过人吗？
Tell me, Raymond,
have you ever killed anyone?

167
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,425
- 没有，太太
- 打仗时也没杀过？
- No, ma'am.
- Not even in combat?

168
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,319
打仗时？
In combat?

169
00:15:31,664 --> 00:15:33,565
是的，太太，我觉得杀过
Yes, ma'am, I think so.

170
00:15:33,565 --> 00:15:35,301
你当然杀过，Raymond
Of course you have, Raymond.

171
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:37,970
Raymond 从小就是一个神枪手
Raymond has been a crack shot
since childhood.

172
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:41,373
这是他好斗天性的绝佳发泄方法
Marvelous outlet for his aggressions.

173
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:43,175
能给我把刺刀吗？
May I have the bayonet, please?

174
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:46,712
别用刀，用手
Not with the knife.
With the hands.

175
00:15:46,712 --> 00:15:48,547
用手？
With the hands?

176
00:15:48,547 --> 00:15:50,412
来，用这个
Here, have him use this.

177
00:15:57,923 --> 00:16:03,295
Raymond，今天，在你团队里你最喜欢谁？
Raymond, whom do you dislike the least
in your group here today?

178
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,763
- 最喜欢？
- 是的
- The least?
- That's right.

179
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,668
我猜是Marco上尉，太太
I guess Capt. Marco, ma'am.

180
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:12,972
有没有注意到他是如何被权威所吸引的？
Notice how he is always
drawn to authority?

181
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,673
这可不行，Raymond
That won't do, Raymond.

182
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:17,009
我们需要上尉给你颁发你的勋章
We need the captain
to get you your medal.

183
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:19,178
还有谁？
Whom else?

184
00:16:19,178 --> 00:16:22,948
- 那就是Ed Mavole了，太太
- 好的
- I guess Ed Mavole, ma'am.
- That's better.

185
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:26,611
现在，Raymond，拿着这条围巾...
Now then, Raymond,
take this scarf...

186
00:16:29,888 --> 00:16:34,393
勒死Ed Mavole
and strangle Ed Mavole
to death.

187
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:35,883
好的，太太
Yes, ma'am.

188
00:16:39,064 --> 00:16:40,861
让一下，Ben
Excuse me, Ben.

189
00:16:44,937 --> 00:16:46,370
让一下吧
Pardon me.

190
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:54,880
嘿，中士，停下
Hey, Sarge, cut it out.

191
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:56,849
请安静，Ed
Quiet, Ed, please.

192
00:16:56,849 --> 00:17:00,986
现在请你安静地坐好并且配合他
Now, you just sit there quietly
and cooperate.

193
00:17:00,986 --> 00:17:02,385
好的，太太
Yes, ma'am.

194
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:15,801
少校，据你所知...
Major, to your knowledge...

195
00:17:15,801 --> 00:17:19,396
其他你的侦察队的成员有没有谁做同样的梦？
have any other ex-members of your
patrol had similar dreams?

196
00:17:21,306 --> 00:17:23,331
不，先生，我不知道还有谁也做同样的梦
No, sir, not to my knowledge.

197
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:28,313
大家有没有对Mavole是行动中死去的两位烈士之一...
Doesn't it strike any one as curious...

198
00:17:28,313 --> 00:17:31,544
这件事感到好奇？
that Mavole was one of the two men
lost in the action?

199
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,819
不过，每晚在我的梦里...
Yet, every night in my dream...

200
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:39,089
他都被Raymond给...
he's the one that Raymond...

201
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,862
我很抱歉，先生们
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

202
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,531
行了，听着，Marco少校
Now look, Maj. Marco...

203
00:17:45,531 --> 00:17:49,401
自从你第一次告诉我们你那不断重复的噩梦，引起了我们的注意时...
since you first brought this recurring
dream of yours to our attention...

204
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,304
Raymond Shaw，他的妻子，他的背景，他的习惯...
Raymond Shaw, his life,
his background, his habits...

205
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:55,607
他的朋友和同事就都被仔细地盘查过了
his friends and associates have been
under scrupulous examination.

206
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:58,210
事实自己会说话，他是清白的
The facts speak for themselves.

207
00:17:58,210 --> 00:18:00,879
他的继父是美国参议员
His stepfather is
a United States senator.

208
00:18:00,879 --> 00:18:04,083
他的母亲是好几个爱国组织的头儿
His mother is head of different
patriotic organizations.

209
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,686
Raymond他本人还是Holborn Gaines最亲密的助理
Raymond himself works as confidential
assistant to Holborn Gaines...

210
00:18:07,686 --> 00:18:10,122
Holborn Gaines可是美国最受人尊重的政治记者
the most respected political journalist in America.

211
00:18:10,122 --> 00:18:12,558
- 真是不可思议...
- Marco少校
- It's inconceivable...
- Major Marco.

212
00:18:12,558 --> 00:18:14,393
我作为精神病咨询专家...
As the consulting
psychiatrist present...

213
00:18:14,393 --> 00:18:17,988
我很有兴趣听听你对Shaw的个人感觉如何
I'd be interested in hearing
your personal feelings about Shaw.

214
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:23,869
Raymond Shaw是我见过的最友好...
Raymond Shaw is the kindest,
bravest, warmest...

215
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:26,905
最勇敢，最热情，最完美的人
most wonderful human being
I've ever known in my life.

216
00:18:26,905 --> 00:18:28,474
我知道了
I see.

217
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:31,477
少校，你是不是一直秉持着这个对他的评价？
And this opinion, Major,
was it generally held?

218
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:34,947
他的士兵伙伴们，也这么看他吗？
His fellow soldiers, did they feel
the same way toward him?

219
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,416
他们都喜欢他，先生
The men loved him, sir.

220
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,985
怎么会不喜欢呢？他救了他们的命
Why shouldn't they?
He saved their lives.

221
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:42,688
对我来说很明显嘛，
It would seem obvious to me...

222
00:18:42,688 --> 00:18:44,923
Marco少校正在遭受着...
that Maj. Marco is suffering
a delayed reaction...

223
00:18:44,923 --> 00:18:48,560
对在朝鲜连续战斗18个月的延迟反应
to 18 months of continuous
combat in Korea.

224
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:52,364
我强烈建议Raymond Shaw的事情就别再讨论了，
I strongly recommend that the matter of
Raymond Shaw be dropped here and now...

225
00:18:52,364 --> 00:18:56,535
然后就暂时分配给Marco少校...
and that Maj. Marco
be temporarily reassigned...

226
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:59,071
一些更轻松并且，我得说，更不敏感的工作
to less strenuous and, if I may say so,
less sensitive duties.

227
00:18:59,071 --> 00:19:03,742
我觉得在参与几个月的...
I think a few months'
detached service...

228
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:06,178
像是，公共关系工作后...
to, perhaps, the Public
Relations Corps...

229
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:09,348
少校应该就会恢复健康了
should put the Major right
back in the pink.

230
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:11,150
部长先生...
Mr. Secretary...

231
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,519
部长先生，你能向我们解释一下预算削减的提案吗？
Mr. Secretary, can you explain
the proposed cut in budget?

232
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,057
先生，你既然问了一个直接的问题
Since, sir, you've asked
a simple-minded question...

233
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:22,361
我就给你一个直接的答案
I will give you an equally
simple-minded answer.

234
00:19:22,361 --> 00:19:25,764
当今世界没有能威胁到自由世界的海军力量了...
Since no great naval power
menaces the free world today...

235
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:30,035
所以海军舰艇数量的压倒性优势似乎已经是没有必要了
the Navy's overwhelming preponderance
of surface ships seems to be superfluous.

236
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:32,304
所以我们要削减预算
Hence the cut in budget.

237
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:35,040
少校，我的时间很宝贵
Major, my time is important.

238
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,310
咱们还得在这儿说多久的废话？
How much longer must we go on
with this nonsense?

239
00:19:38,310 --> 00:19:42,940
如果没有更多的问题，那采访可以结束了
If there are no further questions,
I think that about wraps things up.

240
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:48,353
部长先生，我还有问题，先生
Mr. Secretary,
I have a question, sir.

241
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,055
先生，你是谁？
Who are you, sir?

242
00:19:50,055 --> 00:19:53,892
我是美国参议员John Yerkes Iselin
I am United States Senator
John Yerkes Iselin.

243
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:56,461
我有个严肃的问题...
And I have a question so serious...

244
00:19:56,461 --> 00:20:00,761
我们的国家安全或许就取决于你的答案
that the safety of our nation may well
depend on your answer.

245
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,093
你谁？
Who?

246
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:08,340
别回避我的问题，部长先生，别回避
No evasions, Mr. Secretary,
no evasions, if you please, sir.

247
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:10,776
回避？你在说什么？
Evasions? What the hell
are you talking about?

248
00:20:10,776 --> 00:20:12,444
这是个什么？傻逼吗？
What kind of foolishness is this?

249
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:15,781
部长先生，我是个新手，但我不觉得...
I'm new at this job, but I don't
think it's good public relations...

250
00:20:15,781 --> 00:20:18,617
这样跟一个参议员说话会有利于公共关系发展，即使他是个傻逼
to talk that way to a senator,
even if he is an idiot.

251
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:22,254
我是美国参议员John Yerkes Iselin...
I am United States Senator
John Yerkes Iselin...

252
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:27,192
并且我手里有一份列有270个人名的名单...
and I have here a list
of the names of 270 persons...

253
00:20:27,192 --> 00:20:30,028
这207个人我们的国防部长都认识...
who are known
by the Secretary of Defense...

254
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:33,599
并且他们都是共产党...
as being members of
the Communist Party...

255
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:37,035
并且这个人还在为国防部工作...
and who are still, nevertheless,
working at shaping the policy...

256
00:20:37,035 --> 00:20:41,073
居然，仍然在为我们的国家制定国防政策！
of the Defense Department!

257
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:45,877
- 你是谁？
- 我要求答案
- Senator who?
- I demand an answer.

258
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:48,247
先生，你什么都掩盖不了
There will be no covering up, sir.

259
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:51,016
- 什么？
- 你什么都掩盖不了
- What?
- No covering up.

260
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:55,020
- 你是不会得到这份名单的
- 你是怎么混进来的？
- You won't get your hands on this list.
- How did you get in here in the first place?

261
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,457
- 少校，把这个疯子扔出去
- 并且我郑重地...
- Major, throw that lunatic out of here.
- And I deeply regret having to say...

262
00:20:58,457 --> 00:21:02,794
- 面对着在场的女士们和先生们...
- 你自称是参议员？
- in front of these ladies and gentlemen...
- You claim to be a senator?

263
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:08,367
还有我们伟大的国家里所有的听众们观众们，对你说，你已经失去了我的信任
...and the radio audience of our great nation
that you no longer have my confidence.

264
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,569
你是个傻逼，你疯了
You're an idiot, if you ask me.
You're out of your mind.

265
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:15,240
这已经不是国防部内部调查就能解决的事了
This is no longer a matter for investigation
by the Defense Department.

266
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,009
滚出去！
Get out of here!

267
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,112
- 我恐怕你已经没有机会了
- 来人把他拉出去
- I'm afraid you've lost your chance.
- Get that man out of this room.

268
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:26,485
这件事已经由美国参议院负责了
This matter is now the responsibility
of the United States Senate.

269
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:30,422
我不想让他呆在这儿，听到了吗？把他带走！
I will not have him in here,
do you hear me? Not ever!

270
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:34,760
如果我再在这个房间里看见你，我会亲自把你扔出去
If I ever catch you in this room again,
I'll throw you out bodily.

271
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,762
你还想干什么？滚
What do you want?
Get out of here.

272
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:39,097
- 等一下
- 你别再拍了！
- Hold it.
- Don't you take my picture anymore.

273
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,894
把人都赶走！
Clear this room!

274
00:21:42,267 --> 00:21:46,405
Iselin参议员，我想核实一下你说的数字
Sen. Iselin.
I'd like to verify that number, sir.

275
00:21:46,405 --> 00:21:48,874
你说有多少共产党员？
How many Communists did you say?

276
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:51,176
确切地说...
I said there are exactly...

277
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:53,011
我有证据表明...
I have proof there are...

278
00:21:53,011 --> 00:21:56,148
在国防部里有104个正式的共产党员
104 card-carrying Communists
in the Defense Department.

279
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,849
多少，先生？
How many, sir?

280
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:01,920
275，我现在只能说这么多了
275, and that's all I have to say
on the subject at this time.

281
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,922
少校，他说有多少？
Major, how many did he say?

282
00:22:03,922 --> 00:22:05,253
抱歉等一会儿
Excuse me just a moment.

283
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:08,817
少校，他说有多少？
Major, how many did he say?

284
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:55,907
- 很好，Raymond
- 谢谢，太太
- Very good, Raymond.
- Thank you, ma'am.

285
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:58,710
- Marco上尉？
- 在
- Capt. Marco?
- Yes.

286
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,812
请站起来上尉
On your feet, Captain, please.

287
00:23:00,812 --> 00:23:02,177
抱歉，太太
Sorry, ma'am.

288
00:23:03,815 --> 00:23:06,818
上尉，当你和你的侦察队返回朝鲜时...
Captain，when you are returned
with your patrol to Korea...

289
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:09,688
你去司令部...
and you make your way
to Command Headquarters...

290
00:23:09,688 --> 00:23:12,680
要做的第一件事是什么？
what will be the first duty
you will undertake?

291
00:23:13,859 --> 00:23:16,561
太太，我会汇报巡逻情况
I will make my report
on the patrol, ma'am.

292
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,064
你会汇报什么？
What will you report?

293
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:20,932
我会立马推荐...
I will recommend urgently...

294
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:24,202
Raymond Shaw，请求授予他最高荣耀勋章
that Raymond Shaw be posted
for the Medal of Honor.

295
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:28,707
他救了我们的命并且消灭了一整个连的中国步兵
He saved our lives and took out
a complete company of Chinese infantry.

296
00:23:28,707 --> 00:23:31,076
一整个连？这什么意思？
A complete company?
What the hell is this?

297
00:23:31,076 --> 00:23:36,481
我们可以为这个特别的计划省下一个虚构的步兵连...
We can spare an imaginary company
of infantry for this particular plan...

298
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:39,251
- Mikhail Mikhailovich
- 好吧
- Mikhail Mikhailovich.
- All right.

299
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:43,054
如果，我们要在全世界的报纸上...
If we are out to humiliate
our brave Chinese ally...

300
00:23:43,054 --> 00:23:45,290
羞辱我们的英勇的中国同盟...
in the newspapers of the world...

301
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,460
我们应该写他歼灭了一个营
we might as well make it
a full battalion.

302
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:52,197
我们不反对，同志，我向你保证
We don't object, Comrade,
I assure you of that.

303
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:56,463
不过，同志，我们也谢谢你用这种眼光考虑这件事
However, Comrade, we thank you for
thinking of the matter in that light.

304
00:23:57,602 --> 00:24:01,265
我们能继续示范了吗？
If we may proceed
with the demonstration...

305
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:10,445
这个坐在上尉旁边的人是谁？
who is that little fellow
sitting next to the Captain?

306
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:13,985
是Bobby Lembeck...
That's Bobby Lembeck...

307
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:16,621
我觉得你会叫他，我们的吉祥物
our mascot, I guess you'd call him.

308
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:19,524
看起来还没到能参加你们军队的年龄
Doesn't look old enough
to be in your army.

309
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:21,788
我猜也是，但他已经入伍了，太太
I guess he isn't, but there he is, ma'am.

310
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:27,365
Marco上尉，能请你好心把你的枪借给Raymond吗？
Capt. Marco, will you be good enough
to lend Raymond your pistol, please?

311
00:24:27,365 --> 00:24:28,730
好的，太太
Yes, ma'am.

312
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,571
- 谢谢，Ben
- 没事儿孩子
- Thanks, Ben.
- Sure, kid.

313
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,146
向Bobby开枪，Raymond
Shoot Bobby, Raymond.

314
00:24:41,146 --> 00:24:43,011
打他的前额
Through the forehead.

315
00:24:57,796 --> 00:25:00,432
醒醒，没事了
Wake up, it's all right.

316
00:25:00,432 --> 00:25:02,767
没事了
Everything's all right.

317
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:06,671
放心吧，没事了
It's all right.

318
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:08,662
又是同一个梦？
That same dream again?

319
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:15,780
更糟糕的是...
What makes it so awful...

320
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:19,784
不断地梦着Shaw中士干那些事
is to keep dreaming a thing
like that about Sgt. Shaw.

321
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:22,954
已经连着几个周都做这个梦了
It's been going on for weeks, now.

322
00:25:22,954 --> 00:25:24,990
我一定是要疯了
I must be going crazy.

323
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,125
你应该给Shaw中士写封信
You ought to write to Sgt. Shaw.

324
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:32,290
- 我跟你说了我没事
- 问问是不是还有别人也做同样的梦
- I tell you, nothing's wrong with me.
- Ask if anyone else is having similar dreams.

325
00:25:33,632 --> 00:25:35,156
或许我会写
Maybe I will.

326
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:38,530
或许我会写的
Maybe I'll do that.

327
00:25:39,938 --> 00:25:43,108
如果有人能帮助我，那只有他了
If anybody can help me, he can.

328
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:45,810
你很喜欢他不是吗？
You like him a lot, don't you?

329
00:25:45,810 --> 00:25:47,746
Raymond Shaw是我见过的...
Raymond Shaw is the bravest,
kindest, warmest...

330
00:25:47,746 --> 00:25:50,408
最友好，最勇敢，最热情，最完美的人
most wonderful human being
I've ever known in my life.

331
00:27:20,572 --> 00:27:24,576
亲爱的中士，我不得不把这件事说出了，或者把这件事写给别人
Dear Sarge，I had to say this or write this
to someone

332
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:26,778
因为我觉得我要疯了
because I think I'm going nuts.

333
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:30,682
由于你是我在军队里最好的朋友，所以我告诉你
And since you were
my best friend in the Army, here goes.

334
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:32,717
中士，我有麻烦了
Sarge, I'm in trouble.

335
00:27:32,717 --> 00:27:36,554
我不敢睡觉因为我会做噩梦
I'm afraid to go to sleep
because I have terrible dreams.

336
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:39,991
我梦到了你获得勋章时所在的那支侦察队里的所有成员
I dream about all the guys on the patrol
where you won the medal

337
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,761
并且梦里还有很多中国人
and the dream has
a lot of Chinese people in it,

338
00:27:42,761 --> 00:27:45,830
还有不少俄罗斯军队的高级领导人
and a lot of big brass
from the Russian Army.

339
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:49,766
这只是大体的描述，你一定得相信我的话
Well, it's pretty rough,
you have to take my word for that.

340
00:27:56,541 --> 00:28:00,378
- 请接Raymond Shaw
- 我就是
- Raymond Shaw, please.
- This is he.

341
00:28:00,378 --> 00:28:05,247
Raymond，你怎么不玩玩单人纸牌消遣消遣呢？
Raymond, Why don't you pass the time
by playing a little solitaire?

342
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:14,573
- 看到方块皇后了吗？
- 是的，先生
- Can you see the red queen?
- Yes, sir.

343
00:29:15,286 --> 00:29:16,253
很好
Good.

344
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:21,626
下个周六，你会在...
One week from next Saturday,
you will be called for 

345
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:25,597
上午11:10分接到一通电话，然后会带你去
Timothy Swardon疗养院
at 11:10 a.m. and taken to the Timothy Swardon
Sanitarium, 

346
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,600
在61大街东84号
84 East 61st Street.

347
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,195
我们想让你在那儿做个体检，
你清楚吗？
We want you there for a checkup.
Is that clear?

348
00:29:34,806 --> 00:29:38,765
你可以把牌收起来了，再见，Raymond
You may put the cards away now.
Goodbye, Raymond.

349
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:57,128
Gaines先生，是Shaw先生，出事了
Mr. Gaines, it's Mr. Shaw.

350
00:29:57,128 --> 00:29:59,931
他出车祸了，肇事司机跑了
He was run down on the street
by a hit-and-run driver.

351
00:29:59,931 --> 00:30:01,566
美联社发的消息，
It just came over the AP.

352
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:03,368
天啊
Good heavens.

353
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:04,969
查查他在哪个医院，给他们打电话
Find out what hospital he's in,
and call them.

354
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,130
看看咱们能不能帮上什么忙
See if there's anything
we can do to help.

355
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,809
你太客气了，再见
You're welcome. Goodbye.

356
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:17,582
是Gaines先生从他的报社打来的
That was Mr. Gaines,
from his newspaper.

357
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:20,852
他说要Raymond安心休息，什么也别担心
He said to tell him to take it easy
and not to worry about a thing.

358
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:23,721
当然，咱们不能告诉他
Which, of course,
we will not tell him...

359
00:30:23,721 --> 00:30:26,485
这事故是早就秘密安排好的
on the chance it is
some sort of pre-arranged code.

360
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:37,468
- Zilkov同志？
- 是，什么事？
- Comrade zilkov?
- Yes?

361
00:30:37,468 --> 00:30:40,232
我是Yen Lo，Pavlov学院的
Yen Lo. Pavlov Institute.

362
00:30:42,907 --> 00:30:43,965
博士...
Doctor...

363
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,034
见到你特别荣幸
an honor and a pleasure.

364
00:30:49,214 --> 00:30:50,647
你们可以走了
You may go.

365
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:05,663
你什么时候到的？
When did you arrive?

366
00:31:05,663 --> 00:31:08,299
我昨晚通过使馆配额飞过来的
I was flown in last night
under embassy quota.

367
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:09,934
一趟令人作呕的旅程
Revolting journey.

368
00:31:09,934 --> 00:31:13,671
Raymond，很高兴能再次见到你
Raymond, it's nice to see you again.

369
00:31:13,671 --> 00:31:15,969
先生，我也很高兴再次见到你
It's nice to see you again, sir.

370
00:31:17,208 --> 00:31:20,211
我们布置的这个精细的现场
We're going through
this elaborate procedure...

371
00:31:20,211 --> 00:31:22,947
只是个预防措施
simply out of precaution...

372
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:25,316
预防万一有人来访
in case there are any visitors.

373
00:31:25,316 --> 00:31:28,547
尽管我想不出来谁会来看望他
Although I cannot imagine
who will visit Raymond.

374
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:35,026
- 你这个地方不错啊
- 谢谢，博士
- Attractive plant you have here.
- Thank you, Doctor.

375
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:38,363
其实这里只是那些有钱酒鬼的疗养院
It's actually a rest home
for wealthy alcoholics.

376
00:31:38,363 --> 00:31:40,627
三年前我们就把这地方盘下来了
We were able to purchase it
three years ago.

377
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:46,237
除了这一层和上面那层出于安全原因封闭了
Except for this floor and the floor above it,
which is sealed for security purposes...

378
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,239
其他的都照常使用
the rest functions quite normally.

379
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,608
这里是苏联在美国的据点之一
It is one of the few Soviet
operations in America...

380
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:54,112
实际上在上个财年这个据点还盈利了
that actually showed a profit
at the end of the last fiscal year.

381
00:31:54,112 --> 00:31:55,807
盈利？财年？
Profit? Fiscal year?

382
00:31:56,848 --> 00:32:00,818
当心，我亲爱的Zilkov，资本主义可是传染性极高的病毒
Beware, my dear Zilkov.
The virus of capitalism's highly infectious.

383
00:32:00,818 --> 00:32:03,651
很快你就会往外放贷了
Soon, you'll be lending money out
at interest.

384
00:32:05,990 --> 00:32:10,228
Zilkov同志，你一定得试着培养幽默感
You must try, Comrade Zilkov,
to cultivate a sense of humor.

385
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:15,033
没有什么比笑一笑能更好地减轻一天的烦恼了
There is nothing like a good laugh
to lighten the burdens o the day.

386
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,301
告诉我，Raymond...
Tell me, Raymond...

387
00:32:16,301 --> 00:32:20,004
你还记得自己谋杀了Mavole 和 Lembeck吗?
do you remember murdering
Mavole and Lembeck?

388
00:32:20,004 --> 00:32:21,873
你能再说一遍吗？先生？
I beg your pardon, sir?

389
00:32:21,873 --> 00:32:24,042
Mavole 和 Lembeck
Mavole and Lembeck...

390
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,711
侦察队的那两位烈士
the men who were lost
on the patrol.

391
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,906
你能记起来他们发生了什么事吗？
Do you recall
what happened to them?

392
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:35,286
那是一次目标明确的夜晚行动
It was a very clear action
for a night action.

393
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:37,789
Marco上尉发射了几个低空信号弹
Capt. Marco sent up
some low flares...

394
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,825
所以能很清楚地看到发生了什么
so it was easy to see
what was happening.

395
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:43,828
Bobby Lembeck被分割到了左边
Bobby Lembeck got separated
to the left.

396
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:45,489
Mavole跟在他的后面
Mavole went after him.

397
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:49,830
当他跟上Bobby时敌人已经确定了他们的位置
By the time he reached him,
the enemy had a fix on the position.

398
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:55,006
他们立刻就被一发迫击炮弹炸死了
They were killed instantly
by a high mortar shell.

399
00:32:55,006 --> 00:32:56,941
我觉得他们都不知道被什么打中了
I don't think they ever knew
what hit them.

400
00:32:56,941 --> 00:32:59,277
同志，你能明白...
Do you realize, Comrade...

401
00:32:59,277 --> 00:33:03,414
任你支配的武器的意义吗？
the implications of the weapon
that has been placed at your disposal?

402
00:33:03,414 --> 00:33:05,439
Raymond，你可以摘掉头上的绷带了
You may remove
your head bandage, Raymond.

403
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:10,922
一个正常的，接受过正规教育的美国人
A normally conditioned
American...

404
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:14,092
被培养成一个杀手，并且对自己杀人这件事没有一点记忆
who has been trained to kill and then
to have no memory of having killed.

405
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:18,229
没有记忆，他就不会有负罪感
Without memory of his deed,
he cannot possibly feel guilt.

406
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:22,300
当然，他也没有任何理由害怕自己被抓
Nor will he, of course, have any
reason to fear being caught.

407
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:27,538
在减轻了那些美国特有的负罪感和害怕的症状后，
Having been relieved of those uniquely
American symptoms guilt and fear...

408
00:33:27,538 --> 00:33:30,530
他就不可能泄密了
he can not possibly give himself away.

409
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:36,080
我们的Raymond表面上还会是那个正常的，有用的，
Our Raymond will remain
an outwardly normal, productive...

410
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,649
头脑清醒的，被社会尊重的人
sober and respected member
of the community.

411
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:43,521
我得说，如果咱们使用得当，警察也抓不住他
And, I should say, if properly used,
entirely police-proof.

412
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:49,460
他不单单是被洗脑了，应该说是被干洗了
His brain has not only been washed,
as they say, it has been dry-cleaned.

413
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:56,734
谢谢你，Raymond，你可以把绷带戴回去了
Thank you, Raymond,
you may replace your head bandage.

414
00:33:56,734 --> 00:34:00,271
不管这层封不封闭，你都得允许访客来...
Sealed floors or no, you
will permit him visitors...

415
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:03,274
防止别人起疑
to avoid suspicion.

416
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,777
我的一支专家团队今晚就会飞过来
A team of my specialists
is being flown in tonight.

417
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:08,546
彻底检查他的机能，记得在探望时间的间隔工作
It will take about a week,
working between visiting hours...

418
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,480
得花上大约一个周的时间
to check the mechanism out
completely.

419
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:16,654
毕竟把他催眠已经是两年前的事了
It has been two years since
the conditioning took place.

420
00:34:16,654 --> 00:34:19,757
在把他交给美国的操纵者之前...
And you want to be sure the linkages
are still functioning correctly...

421
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:22,988
必须确定所有的连接都还运转正常
before he is turned over
to his American operator.

422
00:34:24,662 --> 00:34:28,466
- 同志，我得走了
- 你要去哪儿？
- Comrade, if you will excuse me.
- Where are you going?

423
00:34:28,466 --> 00:34:31,536
既然在我的专家们来之前我没啥可干的...
Since I can do nothing more
until my specialists arrive...

424
00:34:31,536 --> 00:34:35,173
我想去梅西百货逛一下午
I had thought to spend
the afternoon at Macy's.

425
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:39,007
我夫人可是给了我一张可怕至极的购物清单
Madame Yen has given me
the most appalling list.

426
00:34:44,482 --> 00:34:48,786
不，不，我以个人名义担保，他已经准备好被交回给美国操控者了
No，no. I personally guarantee it. He is ready to be
turned over to his American operator.

427
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:52,390
我作为苏维埃在
And I, being personally responsible
for Soviet Security...

428
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:55,493
美国东海岸的负责人
in the entire Eastern Seaboard
of the United States...

429
00:34:55,493 --> 00:34:58,329
拒绝把他交回他的操纵者手上
refuse to turn him over
to his operator...

430
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:01,466
除非，至少进行一次实地检测
until at least one practical test
has been run.

431
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:04,168
你说这个男人被培养成了刺客
You say the man has been built
as an assassin.

432
00:35:04,168 --> 00:35:07,695
好啊，那么，让他暗杀个人吧
Very well, then.
Let him assassinate someone.

433
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:14,612
你这样一个肩负重大责任的安全官员...
I'm shocked that a security officer
with the responsibility you hold...

434
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:17,415
会出于纯粹的紧张而让如此有用的Raymond...
would risk a mechanism
as valuable as Raymond...

435
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:20,284
冒这么大的风险，真让我感到惊讶
out of sheer nervousness.

436
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:25,223
你自己也承认他已经两年多没杀人了
You yourself admit the man has not
killed for over two years.

437
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:30,027
我向你保证，博士，我会把风险降到最低
I assure you, Doctor, conditions
offering minimum risk can be arranged.

438
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:32,497
好吧，如果你坚持干这傻事...
All right.
If you insist on this foolishness...

439
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:35,299
就让他在封闭楼层杀一个你的手下吧
have him kill one of your own people
here on a sealed floor.

440
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,235
我很乐意
I would gladly.

441
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:41,339
但现在我们的人员搭配恰好处于一个运转流畅的状态
But our table of organization happens to be
under acceptable strength as it is.

442
00:35:41,339 --> 00:35:43,407
为什么我们不能理性地干这事？
Why can't we be reasonable
about this?

443
00:35:43,407 --> 00:35:47,678
为什么他不能去外面杀个没用的人？
Why can't he kill some
non-productive person on the outside?

444
00:35:47,678 --> 00:35:49,313
那好吧...
Very well, then.

445
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:54,051
不过为了保护他，必须给他下令，
For his own protection, he must be
instructed that if he is ever...

446
00:35:54,051 --> 00:35:56,654
如果他在暗杀现场被发现，
discovered at the scene of an
assignment, this other person...

447
00:35:56,654 --> 00:36:00,625
那他必须杀掉发现他的人或人们
or persons must also be killed.

448
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:05,324
好的，博士，你觉得他应该杀谁?
All right, doctor.
Whom do you think he should kill?

449
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:20,778
要有幽默感，亲爱的Zilkov，时时刻刻都要有幽默感
With humor, my dear Zilkov,
always with a little humor.

450
00:36:20,778 --> 00:36:26,317
如果我们要杀，为了一个更好的纽约，就杀...
If kill we must, for a better New York,
why should it not be...

451
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:31,789
他的报社老板吧
Holborn Gaines先生？
his superior at the newspaper,
Mr. Holborn Gaines?

452
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:34,125
杀了他...
With Mr. Gaines out of the way...

453
00:36:34,125 --> 00:36:39,119
Raymond不就可以升职了吗？
might he not then be given
that very influential job himself?

454
00:36:40,464 --> 00:36:42,200
是谁？
是我，Gaines先生
Who's there?
It's me, Mr. Gaines.

455
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,327
是我，Gaines先生
It's me, Mr. Gaines.

456
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:46,529
Raymond
Raymond.

457
00:36:51,142 --> 00:36:53,911
很抱歉打扰你，先生
I'm sorry to disturb you, sir.

458
00:36:53,911 --> 00:36:58,082
别对我这件长得荒唐的睡衣有什么傻傻的想法
Don't get any silly ideas about
this ridiculous-looking bed jacket.

459
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:01,519
这是我妻子的，这是全家最暖和的衣服了
It was my wife's.
It's the warmest thing I have.

460
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:04,155
晚上穿着在床上看书最好了
Perfect for reading
in bed at night.

461
00:37:04,155 --> 00:37:06,624
我不知道你已经结婚了，先生
I didn't know
you were married, sir.

462
00:37:06,624 --> 00:37:09,093
她六年前死了
She died nearly six years ago.

463
00:37:09,093 --> 00:37:11,829
你凌晨四点来这儿干嘛啊？
What the devil are you doing here
at 4 a.m.

464
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:13,729
你不是应该在医院的吗？
Anyway, I thought you were
in the hospital.

465
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:21,239
别告诉我你这么早来就是为了聊聊
Don't tell me you've come here at
this ridiculous hour to talk something over.

466
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:26,844
你不会是过来掏心窝子告诉我你那风流韵事的细节的吧？
You're not going to pour out your heart with
the details of a sordid love affair, are you?

467
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:31,949
事实上，他们告诉我你应该已经睡了
As a matter of fact,
they told me you'd be asleep.

468
00:37:31,949 --> 00:37:35,586
- 谁说的?
- 他们
- Who told you I'd be asleep?
- They did.

469
00:37:35,586 --> 00:37:37,088
他们？
They?

470
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,055
他们？
They?

471
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:41,318
Who are 'they'?

472
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,028
这神秘的“他们”是谁？
Who's this mysterious 'they'?

473
00:37:44,028 --> 00:37:45,518
回答我，孩子
Answer me, my boy.

474
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,647
- 上校
- Ben
- Colonel.
- Ben.

475
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:06,208
- 我能进来一会儿吗？
- 请进
- May I come in for a minute?
- Please do. Come on in.

476
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:14,859
我问你两个问题，上校，A,这是个正式的访问吗？B，我给你调杯喝的?
May I ask you，Colonel. A Is this an official visit?
And B May I mix you a drink?

477
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:16,761
A，是个正式访问，B，调吧
A Yes, it is,
and B You certainly may.

478
00:38:16,761 --> 00:38:18,695
- 威士忌行吗？
- 行
- Scotch all right?
- Fine.

479
00:38:23,601 --> 00:38:26,092
天啊，你从哪里弄的这么多书？
My God, where do you
get all the books?

480
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:31,442
我一个兰登书屋的朋友给我的
I got a guy who picks them out for me,
at random.

481
00:38:31,442 --> 00:38:32,610
加水？
Water all right?

482
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,612
行
Fine.

483
00:38:34,612 --> 00:38:37,148
他在三藩市...
He's in San Francisco.

484
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:39,450
有个小书店
Got a little bookstore out there...

485
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:42,153
并且我无论驻扎在那儿他都给我寄书
and he ships them to me
wherever I happen to be stationed.

486
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,179
- 你都读过？
- 是的
- You read them all?
- Yeah.

487
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:49,593
它们确实能帮我在敌人进攻时放松自己
They'd also make great insulation
against an enemy attack.

488
00:38:49,593 --> 00:38:53,698
实际上我只是有兴趣读罢了，你知道吗
But the truth of the matter is
that I'm just interested in，you know.

489
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:56,367
像是《现代银行原理》
Principles of Modern Banking

490
00:38:56,367 --> 00:38:57,800
《海盗史》
The History of Piracy

491
00:38:59,236 --> 00:39:01,136
《奥罗斯科画集》
The Paintings of Orozco,

492
00:39:02,239 --> 00:39:03,831
《法国现代戏剧》
Modern French Theater

493
00:39:05,142 --> 00:39:09,714
《黑手党管理的法理因素》
The Jurisprudential Factor
of Mafia Administration,

494
00:39:09,714 --> 00:39:13,377
《马的疾病》还有Joyce Cary的小说还有
Diseases of Horses
and the novels of Joyce Cary and

495
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:18,280
《阿拉伯人的民族选择》，之类的
Ethnic Choices of the Arabs
Things like that

496
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,795
- Ben？
- 先生？
- Ben?
- Sir？

497
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:31,702
军队里有很多事是错的...
The army's got a lot of things
wrong with it...

498
00:39:31,702 --> 00:39:34,694
但它确实照顾自己人，这就是我来这里的原因
but it does take care of its own people,
which is why I'm here.

499
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,176
作为一个公共关系官员，你很失职
As a public relations officer,
you're a disaster.

500
00:39:39,176 --> 00:39:40,945
- 我从没想过干这个工作...
- 不说别的了...
- I never wanted the job..
- Apparently, among other things...

501
00:39:40,945 --> 00:39:45,516
就说你让部长对着那个让他暴跳如雷的傻缺Iselin...
you permitted the Secretary to make some
unfortunate remarks to that idiot Iselin...

502
00:39:45,516 --> 00:39:49,320
- 说了很多不和时宜的话这件事吧
- Mickey，请听我说
- which started him off on a rampage.
- Mickey, listen to me, please.

503
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,023
六个月以来，一个不断重复的梦快要把我逼疯了...
For six months, I've been driven nearly mad
by a recurring dream...

504
00:39:53,023 --> 00:39:54,358
主管的卫生官员会...
The medical officer in charge...

505
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:58,596
卫生官员怎么会懂情报工作？
What the hell does the Medical Corps
know about intelligence work, Milt?

506
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:00,698
告诉你吧，有些事很假，
I tell you,
there's something phony going on.

507
00:40:00,698 --> 00:40:03,167
关于我，Raymond Shaw，还有勋章的事，
There's something phony about me,
Raymond Shaw...

508
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:05,870
有很多疑点
about the whole Medal of Honor
business.

509
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:10,674
举个例子吧，当那个精神病专家问我我对
Raymond的个人看法，
For instance, when the psychiatrist asked
me how I personally felt about Raymond...

510
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:13,411
还有整个侦察队对他的看法时，你听见我是怎么说的吗？
and how the whole patrol felt about him,
did you hear what I said?

511
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,413
你还记得吗？
Did you really hear what I said?

512
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,715
我说：“Raymond Shaw...
I said, 'Raymond Shaw
is the kindest, warmest...

513
00:40:17,715 --> 00:40:21,752
是我见过的最友好，最热情，最勇敢
最完美的人”
'bravest, most wonderful human
being I have ever known.'

514
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:23,788
此时此刻，我依然这么认为，
And even now I feel that way,
this minute.

515
00:40:23,788 --> 00:40:27,658
但是我脑海中有个声音告诉我，这不是真的
Yet, somewhere in the back of my mind,
something tells me it's not true.

516
00:40:27,658 --> 00:40:29,455
这不是我的看法
It's just not true.

517
00:40:30,828 --> 00:40:33,297
Raymond不是不讨人喜欢，
It isn't as if Raymond's hard to like.

518
00:40:33,297 --> 00:40:35,424
而是根本不可能会有人喜欢他！
He's impossible to like!

519
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:39,670
他或许是我见到过的...
He's probably one of
the most repulsive human beings...

520
00:40:39,670 --> 00:40:43,140
最讨厌的人
I've known in all of my life.

521
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:47,378
Ben，我就是来告诉你公共关系部不要你了
Ben, what I came to tell you is
Public Relations has sent you back to me.

522
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:50,541
以你现在的状态，我也没法给你分配工作
And in your present state
there's no possible way I can use you.

523
00:40:52,049 --> 00:40:55,119
现在，我给你无限期的病假
As of this moment,
I'm placing you on indefinite sick leave.

524
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:58,782
Ben，出门放松放松吧，找个姑娘，在太阳底下躺躺
Go away, Ben. Find yourself a girl.
Lie in the sun.

525
00:41:03,594 --> 00:41:06,358
我的回答必然是拒绝
I absolutely refuse.

526
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,600
你没明白
You don't seem to understand.

527
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:17,041
少校，我刚刚给你的不是建议
What I've just told you
is not a suggestion, Major.

528
00:41:17,041 --> 00:41:18,838
而是命令
It is an order.

529
00:41:25,115 --> 00:41:26,514
好吧，长官
Yes, sir.

530
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,477
晚安，Ben
Good night, Ben.

531
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:48,429
- 介意我抽烟吗？
- 没事，抽吧
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Not at all. Please do.

532
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:27,071
马里兰州很美
Maryland's a beautiful state.

533
00:43:27,071 --> 00:43:29,773
- 这里是特拉华州
- 我知道
- This is Delaware.
- I know.

534
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:34,378
我当年参与过这条铁路的铺设工程
I was one of the original Chinese workmen
who laid the track on this stretch.

535
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:37,815
不管怎么说，马里兰州还是很美
But, nonetheless,
Maryland is a beautiful state.

536
00:43:37,815 --> 00:43:40,113
还有俄亥俄州，也很美
So is Ohio, for that matter.

537
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:46,017
我猜也是，哥伦布是个有名的足球城
I guess so. Columbus is
a tremendous football town.

538
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:52,262
- 你是干铁路这行儿的？
- 不干了
- You in the railroad business?
- Not anymore.

539
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:55,065
不过，请让我指出一个问题...
However, if you will permit me
to point out...

540
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:57,301
你应该问我，
when you ask that question,
you should say...

541
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:59,701
“你是干铁路线建设的？”
'Are you in the railroad line? '

542
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:03,606
你哪儿人？
Where's your home?

543
00:44:05,209 --> 00:44:07,473
我来自军队，我是个少校
I'm in the army. I'm a Major.

544
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:12,483
我大半辈子都在军队里度过
I've been in the army most of my life.

545
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:14,246
经常要开拔到不同的地方
We move a good deal.

546
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:19,556
我出生在新罕布什尔州
I was born in New Hampshire.

547
00:44:19,556 --> 00:44:22,354
我曾在那儿的弗朗西斯湖露过一次营
I went to a girls' camp once
on Lake Francis.

548
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:26,059
那可是很往北的地方
That's pretty far north.

549
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,636
- 你叫什么？
- Euginie
- What's your name?
- Euginie.

550
00:44:35,372 --> 00:44:36,707
再说一遍？
Pardon?

551
00:44:36,707 --> 00:44:38,642
没开玩笑，我真叫这个
No kidding, I really mean it.

552
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:40,906
是个法语名，英语发音就成男名了
Crazy French pronunciation
and all.

553
00:44:41,945 --> 00:44:44,573
- 挺好听的
- 谢谢
- It's pretty.
- Thank you.

554
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:48,085
我猜你的朋友们叫你Jennie吧？
I guess your friends
call you Jennie?

555
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:51,155
没这么叫过，我很希望他们能这么叫
Not yet, they haven't,
for which I am deeply grateful.

556
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:54,324
但你可以叫我Jennie
But you may call me Jennie.

557
00:44:54,324 --> 00:44:56,258
你朋友们叫你什么？
What do your friends call you?

558
00:44:57,494 --> 00:44:59,296
Rosie
Rosie.

559
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:01,765
为什么？
Why?

560
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:04,700
我全名是Eugenie Rose
My full name is Eugenie Rose.

561
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,873
这两个名字里，我更喜欢Rosie
Of the two names,
I've always favored Rosie...

562
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:13,331
因为读起来有棕香皂和啤酒的味道
because it smells of brown soap
and beer.

563
00:45:16,113 --> 00:45:18,980
Eugenie读起来太脆弱了
Eugenie is somehow more fragile.

564
00:45:23,721 --> 00:45:27,157
我刚才问你名字时，你说你叫Eugenie
When I asked you what your name was,
you said it was Eugenie.

565
00:45:29,126 --> 00:45:32,960
可能当时我或多或少感觉有些脆弱吧
It's quite possible I was feeling
more or less fragile at that instant.

566
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:40,165
我一直不明白“或多或少”是什么意思
I could never figure out what that
phrase meant 'more or less.'

567
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:45,305
- 你是阿拉伯人？
- 不是
- Are you Arabic?
- No.

568
00:45:50,547 --> 00:45:54,451
我叫Ben，实际上应该是Bennett
My name is Ben. It's really Bennett.

00:45:54,451 --> 00:45:56,687
我父亲用Arnold Bennett的名字给我取名

570
00:45:56,687 --> 00:45:59,890

574
00:46:12,035 --> 00:46:13,969
- 你是阿拉伯人？
- 不是
- Are you Arabic?
- No.

575
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,376
我换个问法吧
Let me put it another way.

576
00:46:19,376 --> 00:46:21,411
你结婚了吗？
Are you married?

577
00:46:21,411 --> 00:46:24,778

587
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:04,754
黄金国59970，我的电话
Eldorado 59970.

588
00:47:05,889 --> 00:47:07,754
记得住吗？
Can you remember that?

589
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:15,530
你驻扎在纽约？
Are you stationed in New York?

590
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,592
“驻扎”这个词用得对吗？
Or is stationed the right word?

591
00:47:24,808 --> 00:47:30,147
不是纽约，我驻扎在华盛顿
I'm not exactly stationed in New York.
I was stationed in Washington.

592
00:47:30,147 --> 00:47:35,586
但我病了，现在在休假，我要去纽约玩
But I got sick, and now I'm on leave

593
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:39,078
黄金国59970

594
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:48,854
我要去看我的一个朋友，他是个记者

who's a newspaper man.

595
00:47:50,601 --> 00:47:53,001

Shaw先生，外面有人想见你
Mr. Shaw, there's a gentleman outside
to see you.

597
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:02,946
- 谁？
- 是个东方人，先生
- A gentleman?
- An Oriental gentleman, sir.

598
00:48:02,946 --> 00:48:05,141
他说他是你的战友

599
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:09,720
我不记得我有东方人战友
There were no Oriental gentlemen
in the army with me.

600
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,950
他坚持要见你，先生，特别坚持
He is very insistent, sir.

601
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:16,292
好吧，让他进来吧

602
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:36,680
我是春锦，Shaw先生，长官

603
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:42,219
我当时是52团查理连队的翻译
I was interpreter attached
to Charlie Company, 52nd Regiment.

604
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:44,021
是，我想起来了
Yes, I remember you.

605
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:46,956
你是侦察队的向导兼翻译
You were the guide and interpreter
to the patrol.

606
00:48:50,928 --> 00:48:52,763
我能为你做点什么？
What can I do for you?

607
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:57,257
- 我是说，你来这儿干什么？
- 你父亲没跟你说吗？
- I mean， what are you doing here?
- Your father did not say to you?

608
00:48:58,502 --> 00:49:01,171
- 我父亲？
- 是的，Iselin参议员，我给他写...
- My father?
- Yes. Sen. Iselin. I write to...

609
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:04,942
他不是我父亲
Sen. Iselin is not my father.

610
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:07,843
我再重复一遍，他不是我父亲
Repeat, he is not my father.

611
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:13,583
如果你来美国这一趟什么也没学到，
那就把这个事实记住吧
If you learn nothing else on your visit
to this country, memorize that fact.

612
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:16,186
我给Iselin参议员写了信
I write to Sen. Iselin.

613
00:49:16,186 --> 00:49:19,323
我告诉他我曾是你们侦察队的翻译
I tell him how I interpret
your outfit.

614
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:24,261
我跟他说我想来美国，他给我办了签证
I tell him I want to come to America.
He get me visa.

615
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:26,096
现在我需要一份工作
Now I need job.

616
00:49:26,096 --> 00:49:27,664
工作？
A job?

617
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:30,100
是的，长官，Shaw先生
Yes, sir, Mr. Shaw.

618
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:32,836
但是亲爱的朋友，我们这儿不需要翻译
But, my dear fellow,
we don't need interpreters here.

619
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:35,038
在美国大家都说英语，要韩语翻译干嘛
We all speak the same language.

620
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:38,675
我是个裁缝，我会修东西
我是个厨师，我会开车
I am tailor and mender.
I am cook, I drive car.

621
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:43,547
我是个清洁工，洗碗工，我什么都能修，
我能帮你收信回信
I am cleaner and scrubber.
I fix anything. I take message.

622
00:49:43,547 --> 00:49:45,777
我住我表哥家
I sleep at house of my cousin.

623
00:49:47,818 --> 00:49:50,454
我来你这儿找工作...
I ask for job with you...

624
00:49:50,454 --> 00:49:54,515
是因为我知道你是那个救了我的命的好人
because you are a great man
who saved my life.

625
00:49:59,296 --> 00:50:02,032
我觉得我会需要一个贴身男仆
I could use a valet, I think.

626
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:05,593
并且还想要个厨子，我强调一下，
得是个好厨子
And I would like having a cook.
A good cook, I mean.

627
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:10,340
好的，你可以住你表哥家
Very well, you can live at your cousin's.

628
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,909
我每周付你60刀
I will pay you $ 60 a week.

629
00:50:12,909 --> 00:50:15,879
你可以每个周四和隔周周日休息
You will have every Thursday
and every other Sunday off.

630
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:19,416
谢谢你，Shaw先生
Thank you, Mr. Shaw.

631
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:21,485
我过会儿要去华盛顿
I'm leaving for Washington
in a few minutes.

632
00:50:21,485 --> 00:50:23,520
晚上8:10分回来，希望桌上会有坐好的晚餐等着我
I'll be back here by 8:10 p.m.
I would like to have dinner waiting.

633
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:25,511
好的长官，Shaw先生
Yes, sir, Mr. Shaw.

634
00:50:26,556 --> 00:50:32,461
晚饭会像在军队那时一样
Just like United States Army.

635
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,961
哦，上帝啊，别
Oh, God, I hope not.

636
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:41,138
你今天下午一定会有非凡的表现的，亲爱的..
You're going to be marvelous
in there this afternoon, hon...

637
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:43,106
我知道你会的
ljust know you are.

638
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:55,352
只有一件事儿还困扰着我，宝贝儿
There's just one thing, babe.

639
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:58,288
如果我们能把国防部里的共产党人数...
I'd be a lot happier if we could just
settle on the number...

640
00:50:58,288 --> 00:51:02,486
确定下来，我会更高兴的
of Communists I know there are
in the Defense Department.

641
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:07,764
我是说，你总是把这个数字变来变去...
I mean, the way you keep changing
the figures on me all the time...

642
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:12,102
这让我看上去像个疯子，像个白痴
it makes me look like
some kind of a nut, an idiot.

643
00:51:12,102 --> 00:51:14,771
甚至还有人拿这个开我玩笑
The boys were even starting
to kid me about it.

644
00:51:14,771 --> 00:51:18,008
就昨天，在衣帽间，他们说：“嘿，Johnny...”
Just yesterday in the cloakroom,
they said, 'Hey, Johnny'...

645
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:23,708
如果你出尔反尔，那你会像个更大的傻瓜
You'll look like an even bigger idiot
if you don't get in there and do exactly what you're told

646
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:28,819
整个美国的报纸都在报道谁？都在讨论什么？
Who are they writing about all over
this country, and what are they saying?

647
00:51:28,819 --> 00:51:32,089
他们写的是：“国防部里有共产党吗?”
是吗？
Are they saying, 'Are there any
Communists in the Defense Department? '

648
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,256
当然不是，他们写的是...
Of course not.
They're saying...

649
00:51:33,256 --> 00:51:36,760
“国防部里有多少共产党？”
'How many Communists
are there in the Defense Department? '

650
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,362
所以别突然装的像很有经验似的说话...
So stop talking like an expert
all of a sudden...

651
00:51:39,362 --> 00:51:42,229
坐好你该做的，出去说你应该说的，
就行了
and get out there and
say what you're supposed to say.

652
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,902
别这样，宝贝儿
Come on, babe.

653
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:47,904
我很抱歉，亲爱的
I'm sorry, hon.

654
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:52,568
如果我们把数字定下来会对你有帮助吗？
Would it really make it easier for you
if we settled on just one number?

655
00:51:55,679 --> 00:52:01,083
一个确定的简单的数字最好了，
我还好记
Just one real simple number
that will be easy for me to remember.

656
00:52:11,995 --> 00:52:16,366
现在，在国防部里...
There are exactly
<i>57</i> card-carrying members...

657
00:52:16,366 --> 00:52:21,531
确切地说，有57名正式的共产党员
of the Communist Party in
the Department of Defense at this time.

658
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:26,008
演讲者请注意议事程序
Point of order, Mr. Speaker.

659
00:52:55,939 --> 00:52:58,464
Raymond到底做了什么事？
What was Raymond doing
with his hands?

660
00:53:03,446 --> 00:53:05,641
那些老太太是怎么变成俄罗斯人的？
How did the old ladies
turn into Russians?

661
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:51,826
Raymond到底做了什么事？
What was Raymond doing
with his hands?

662
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:06,601
那些老太太是怎么变成俄罗斯人的？
Raymond到底做了什么事？
How did the old ladies turn into Russians?
What was Raymond doing with his hands?

663
00:54:07,677 --> 00:54:09,045
你在这儿干嘛？
What were you doing there?

664
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:11,781
Raymond到底做了什么事？
What was Raymond doing
with his hands?

665
00:54:11,781 --> 00:54:14,181
你在这儿干嘛？
What were you doing there?

666
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:40,810
我得说，你让警察局的人打电话给我，约我出来，
It was original of you to have
the police department call so shyly...

667
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:42,801
这个方式很新颖，也显得你很害羞
and ask for our first date.

668
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:49,615
他们问我想打给谁...
They asked me who
I'd be willing to...

669
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:55,523
我知道，谢谢你，非常感谢
I know, and thank you，thank you very much.

670
00:55:23,386 --> 00:55:27,157
我得去找Raymond，说不定他现在在家
I've got to find Raymond.
Maybe he's home by now.

671
00:55:27,157 --> 00:55:29,592
好的，亲爱的，你想干嘛都行
All right, darling.
Whatever you want.

672
00:55:29,592 --> 00:55:32,529
但首先，我得告诉你点事
But first, I have something to tell you.

673
00:55:32,529 --> 00:55:35,765
你知道在你聪明地利用警察约我的时候，
我在干嘛吗？
You know what I was doing
when you so cleverly had the police call?

674
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:38,601
别猜了，你太累了
Don't bother trying to guess,
you're too tired.

675
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:40,637
我直接告诉你吧
I'll tell you what I was doing.

676
00:55:40,637 --> 00:55:43,039
在我下车之后...
After I dropped you off...

677
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:46,276
我就直接往家走，然后我上楼...
I went straight home,
and when I got upstairs...

678
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:50,547
- 3B号公寓
- 是的，很好
- Apartment 3 B.
- That's right. Very good.

679
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:54,745
在我脱下大衣之前，我给我的未婚夫打了电话
Before I even took my coat off,
I telephoned my fiance

680
00:55:55,985 --> 00:56:00,623
我跟你说了我没结婚
但我没说我没订婚
I told you I wasn't married,
I never said I wasn't engaged.

681
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:05,261
继续，我给他打了电话，
Well, I called up my fiance
and he came over as soon as he could...

682
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:06,596
他飞快地赶来了...
which was instantly...

683
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:08,565
然后我告诉他，我遇见了你...
and I told him
I had just met you...

684
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:10,433
然后我把戒指还给了他
and I gave him his ring back.

685
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:16,139
我试着告诉他，我对我可能给他造成的痛苦，
表示遗憾
I tried to convey my regrets for
whatever pain I might be causing him.

686
00:56:16,139 --> 00:56:21,478
这时，警察打来了，说你邀请我去第24分局见你
Just then, you had the police call to invite
me to meet you at the 24th Precinct.

687
00:56:21,478 --> 00:56:24,414
所以我抓起大衣，亲了我的未婚夫一下，
So I grabbed my coat,
kissed my fiance on the cheek...

688
00:56:24,414 --> 00:56:26,783
这是我们俩的最后一吻
for the last time in our lives
we would ever kiss...

689
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:28,114
然后我跑了
and I ran.

690
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:33,923
我到了警察局后，听他们说你殴打了一个大个儿的中国人
At the police station, they told me you had
beaten up a very large Chinese gentleman.

691
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:37,527
不是中国人，亲爱的，是个朝鲜人
至少我认为他是个朝鲜人
Not Chinese, dear, Korean.
At least, I think he was Korean.

692
00:56:37,527 --> 00:56:41,898
一个大个儿的朝鲜人，但他们也向Washington将军确认了...
A large Korean gentleman, but that
you were a pretty solid type yourself...

693
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:44,667
你是个很可靠的人
according to Washington,
with whom they had checked.

694
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:45,668
所以我想...
So I figured...

695
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:49,439
如果他们敢麻烦Washington将军，要对你的评价...
if they'd bother to get a comment
on you from George Washington...

696
00:56:49,439 --> 00:56:52,108
那你一定是个很重要的人物
you must be somebody
very important indeed.

697
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:56,045
我得说，这可不是警局通常的处理方式，
并且你只是个少校
I must say, it was rather sweet of
the general, with you only a major.

698
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:57,808
我还不知道你和Washington将军有联系
I didn't even know you knew him.

699
00:56:59,883 --> 00:57:04,988
如果他们还对你有些小猜疑的话，他们应该问我
If they were the tiniest bit puzzled
about you, they could have asked me.

700
00:57:04,988 --> 00:57:07,657
是的，确实，我亲爱的Ben...
Yes, indeed, my darling Ben...

701
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:10,260
他们应该问我...
they could have asked me...

702
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:12,387
我就会告诉他们...
and I would have told them...

703
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:24,307
- 好久不见，孩子
- 到底出什么事了？
- Hi, kid.
- What in the hell's going on?

704
00:57:24,307 --> 00:57:26,910
我在华盛顿办事儿，他们打来电话说
你闯进了我的公寓...
They called me in Washington to tell me
you'd broken into my apartment...

705
00:57:26,910 --> 00:57:29,105
殴打了我的男仆
and beaten up my houseboy.

706
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:38,488
是的，不过，你知道，春锦，当我...
Yeah, well, see, Chunjin, when I...

707
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:40,820
天啊，你气色怎么这么差？
我从来没见过你这么糟糕的样子
My God, you look terrible.
I've never seen you look so awful.

708
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:00,470
Raymond...
Raymond...

709
00:58:02,111 --> 00:58:06,980
我是来告诉你我那可怕的噩梦的
I want to tell you that I've been
having this terrible nightmare.

710
00:58:19,295 --> 00:58:21,593
我在军队服役十九年了
I've been in the army 19 years.

711
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:25,032
还是第一次见到勋章
First time I've ever seen
one of these.

712
00:58:31,074 --> 00:58:33,008
我一直在做噩梦...
I've been having this nightmare...

713
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:36,935
不断重复的噩梦
a real swinger
of a nightmare, too.

714
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:41,718
梦里有各种各样的奇怪的人
It has to do with
all kinds of strange people.

715
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:45,021
有个苏联将军，一些中国人...
Is it about a Russian general
and some Chinese...

716
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:47,421
还有我和其他侦察队的成员？
and me and the men
who were on the patrol?

717
00:58:48,658 --> 00:58:51,761
你怎么知道？
How did you know that?

718
00:58:51,761 --> 00:58:54,389
把手拿开
Take your hands off me.

719
00:58:56,266 --> 00:59:01,203
求你了，Raymond，告诉我，
你怎么知道的？
Please, Raymond, tell me,
how did you know?

720
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,407
我不是真的知道这个噩梦
I don't really know
anything about it.

721
00:59:04,407 --> 00:59:08,111
- 但你刚刚告诉我...
- 你记得Al Melvin吗？
- But you just started to tell me...
- Do you remember Al Melvin?

722
00:59:08,111 --> 00:59:10,046
- 侦察队里的下士？
- 是的，我知道
- The corporal in the patrol?
- Yes, of course.

723
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,849
我几个星期前收到了他的一封信
I had a letter from him
a couple of weeks ago.

724
00:59:12,849 --> 00:59:16,219
不用说，收到他的来信我很惊讶
Needless to say, I was very surprised to hear from him.

725
00:59:16,219 --> 00:59:19,055
你知道侦察队里的人有多恨我
You know how much
the guys in the outfit hated me.

726
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:21,190
当然，远不及我恨他们
Well, not as much as I hated them,
of course.

727
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:23,526
但是呢，有趣的一点是...
But anyway, the funny thing was...

728
00:59:23,526 --> 00:59:28,231
他在信里说我是他在服役时最好的朋友
he said in his letter that I was
the best friend he had in the army.

729
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:31,167
我是他在服役时最好的朋友
I was the best friend
he had in the army.

730
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:33,136
这个可怜的，天真的傻蛋
The poor, simple boob.

731
00:59:33,136 --> 00:59:35,705
然后，他想跟我说说他的噩梦
Anyway, he wanted to tell me
about his nightmare.

732
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:38,003
他说他快被折磨疯了
He said he was going out
of his mind.

733
00:59:40,376 --> 00:59:43,446
告诉我，关于噩梦他都说了什么
Tell me what he said
about the nightmare.

734
00:59:43,446 --> 00:59:46,916
他不断梦到整个侦察队坐在酒店礼堂里...
He keeps dreaming that the patrol
is sitting in a hotel lobby...

735
00:59:46,916 --> 00:59:51,087
还有很多中国高级军官和苏联将军
and there are a lot of Chinese brass
and Russian generals...

736
00:59:51,087 --> 00:59:53,356
然而这有什么可怕的？
Anyway, what's nightmarish
about that?

737
00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:56,326
信呢？你还留着吗？
The letter?
Have you got the letter?

738
00:59:56,326 --> 00:59:59,362
没有，我从不留信
No, I don't.
I never keep letters.

739
00:59:59,362 --> 01:00:01,698
这就是他说的？再没了？
That's all he wrote?
That was the end of it?

740
01:00:01,698 --> 01:00:04,901
怎么了？你梦到的是一样的东西吗？
Why? Is it the same thing
you've been dreaming?

741
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:07,103
能帮我个忙吗？
Do something for me, will you?

742
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:10,006
给黄金国59970打电话
Call Eldorado 59970.

743
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:12,008
如果是一个年轻的女士接的...
If a young lady answers...

744
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:15,044
告诉她我去了华盛顿，是地名，不是那个将军
tell her I've gone to Washington.
The town, not the general.

745
01:00:15,044 --> 01:00:17,347
我会尽快和她联系的
I'll be in touch with her
as quickly as I can

746
01:00:17,347 --> 01:00:20,976
你会帮我的吧？电话是黄金国59970
You'll do that, won't you?
Eldorado 59970.

747
01:00:28,224 --> 01:00:31,027
为了解开这个谜团，我们会给你展示一些照片...
To take some of the mystery out of it,
the photographs you're looking at...

748
01:00:31,027 --> 01:00:36,399
有男模，墨西哥马戏演员
are shots of male models,
Mexican circus performers...

749
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:38,935
捷克化学家
Czech research chemists...

750
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:40,670
日本罪犯
Japanese criminals...

751
01:00:40,670 --> 01:00:42,672
法国领班
French headwaiters...

752
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:46,376
土耳其摔跤手，乡村精神科医生
Turkish wrestlers,
pastoral psychiatrists...

753
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:49,912
当然，还有很多苏联的...
and, of course, various
officials of the USSR...

754
01:00:49,912 --> 01:00:52,048
中华人民共和国的...
the People's Republic of China...

755
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:54,073
苏联军队的官员
and the Soviet Army.

756
01:00:56,252 --> 01:00:58,413
请把右边这张留下
Hold the one on the right, please.

757
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,132
这张也留下
Hold this one, too.

758
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:23,446
就在一小时前，你的朋友Alan Melvin先生...
Exactly one hour ago, your friend
Mr. Alan Melvin, in Alaska...

759
01:01:23,446 --> 01:01:26,142
在阿拉斯加，也选了同样的照片
made the same two photographs.

760
01:01:28,751 --> 01:01:31,515
他在梦里是戴着眼镜的，笑起来像个色魔
This one here wore sunglasses,
smelled like a goat.

761
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:38,528
胡子要稀一些，他的声音很洪亮，很刺耳
His moustache was a little thinner then.
He had a loud voice, and it grated.

762
01:01:38,528 --> 01:01:41,831
他大约5尺11英寸高，偏胖
He's about 5-11,
on the heavy side.

763
01:01:41,831 --> 01:01:44,197
穿着中将服
Uniformed as a lieutenant general.

764
01:01:45,334 --> 01:01:48,905
他手下穿着平常衣服，
看起来像是一帮F.B.I的人
His staff wore civilian clothes.
They looked a little like F.B.I. Men.

765
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:51,641
顺便一提，他的名字是Berezovo
His name, incidentally, is Berezovo.

766
01:01:51,641 --> 01:01:53,802
是中央委员会的成员
He's a member of
the Central Committee.

767
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:58,381
这个在梦里穿着便服，但手下都穿制服...
This one wore civilian clothes,
but his staff was uniformed...

768
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:01,818
上至上校下至中尉
varying from a full colonel
to a first lieutenant.

769
01:02:01,818 --> 01:02:04,184
他们都是重要的政治人物
开灯
They wore political markings.
Lights.

770
01:02:04,320 --> 01:02:05,548
开灯
Lights.

771
01:02:11,994 --> 01:02:18,868
我会向上面建议展开联合调查，联合中情局和联调局，
I'm going to recommend setting up
a joint-intelligence, C.I.A. F.B.I. Unit...

772
01:02:18,868 --> 01:02:20,503
以纽约为大本营
based out of New York.

773
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:23,206
你会代表军队跟他们一起工作
You'll work with them,
representing the army.

774
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:26,242
- 你的助手是Raymond Shaw
- 很好，上校
- Your assignment's Raymond Shaw.
- Very good, Colonel.

775
01:02:26,242 --> 01:02:28,811
他会是个好助手的，少校...
It should be a very pleasant
assignment, Major...

776
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:32,381
毕竟他是你遇到过的最友好，最勇敢...
considering that Raymond Shaw
is the kindest, bravest...

777
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:37,318
最热心，最完美的人
warmest, most wonderful human being
you've ever met in your life.

778
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:45,061
我的母亲，Ben，是个可怕的女人
My mother, Ben, is a terrible woman.

779
01:02:45,061 --> 01:02:48,360
好可怕，好可怕的女人
A terrible, terrible woman.

780
01:02:52,468 --> 01:02:53,435
春锦
Chunjin.

781
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:55,671
春锦
Chunjin.

782
01:02:55,671 --> 01:02:58,474
再来点儿红酒
We would like some more wine.

783
01:02:58,474 --> 01:02:59,941
春锦
Chunjin.

784
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:03,279
哦，我忘了
Oh, I forgot.

785
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:07,583
在你给我打电话之后，我给了春锦一晚上的假
After you called,
I gave Chunjin the night off.

786
01:03:07,583 --> 01:03:10,486
我告诉他，因为今天是圣诞前夜
Because it was Christmas Eve,
I told him.

787
01:03:10,486 --> 01:03:12,920
他很不情愿地走了
He was very reluctant to go.

788
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:17,949
可能他是个佛教徒，不过圣诞节
That's probably because he's a Buddhist,
and he doesn't celebrate Christmas.

789
01:03:19,128 --> 01:03:22,899
我不觉得春锦是个佛教徒
I don't think that Chunjin
is a Buddhist.

790
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:25,434
他总是微笑着，
He smiles all the time.

791
01:03:25,434 --> 01:03:27,870
真遗憾
What a shame.

792
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:29,372
我觉得他信佛
I thought he was a Buddhist.

793
01:03:29,372 --> 01:03:32,208
信的话我就会给他寄张圣诞贺卡了
Otherwise I would have sent him
a Christmas card.

794
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:34,472
但我想...
But I figured...

795
01:03:36,045 --> 01:03:39,674
如果我在圣诞节给他寄贺卡...
that if I sent him a card
at this time of the year...

796
01:03:42,084 --> 01:03:46,055
那他之后会在佛祖的生日给我寄贺卡的
then he would have to send me a card
on the Buddha's birthday.

797
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:48,057
- 要面子，对吧？
- 是啊
- To save face, right?
- Right.

798
01:03:48,057 --> 01:03:49,992
这样的话整个事儿就会越来越复杂
And that would have started
a whole big magilla.

799
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:55,589
是的，你做得非常对
Exactly. You did exactly the right thing.

800
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:02,962
“圣诞节十二天”（注：BGM）
<i>Twelve Days of Christmas.</i>

801
01:04:04,473 --> 01:04:07,874
圣诞节有一天就够烦人的了
One day of Christmas is loathsome enough.

802
01:04:09,745 --> 01:04:10,746
我们刚刚聊什么来着？ 
对，我妈
What were we saying?
Oh, yes, my mother.

803
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:15,718
但你不会想听我说这个的...
But you don't want to listen to me
talking about...

804
01:04:15,718 --> 01:04:18,487
不，说吧，我很感兴趣
Of course I do.
I'm interested.

805
01:04:18,487 --> 01:04:23,960
这就和听俄瑞斯忒斯抱怨克吕泰墨斯特拉差不多
It's rather like listening to Orestes
gripe about Clytemnestra.

806
01:04:23,960 --> 01:04:27,530
- 谁？
- 戏剧里的两个希腊人物
- Who?
- A couple of Greeks in a play.

807
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,656
你知道吗，Ben...
You know, Ben...

808
01:04:29,765 --> 01:04:32,969
恨自己的母亲是件很可怕很糟糕的事
it's a terrible thing
to hate your mother.

809
01:04:32,969 --> 01:04:35,338
但我不是一直都恨她
But I didn't always hate her.

810
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:39,604
当我还是个孩子时，我只是有点不喜欢她
When I was a child,
I only kind of disliked her.

811
01:04:40,743 --> 01:04:43,507
但当她对我和Jocie做了那事之后...
But after what she did to
Jocie and me...

812
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:47,717
我就开始恨她了
that's when I began to hate her.

813
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,752
Jocie？
Jocie?

814
01:04:49,752 --> 01:04:51,447
Jocie Jordan
Jocie Jordan.

815
01:04:52,788 --> 01:04:55,018
Jordan参议员的女儿
Sen. Jordan's daughter.

816
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:57,887
这有点意思，不是吗？
That's pretty funny, isn't it?

817
01:05:02,031 --> 01:05:04,431
Thomas Jordan的女儿
Thomas Jordan's daughter...

818
01:05:05,801 --> 01:05:08,895
和Johnny Iselin的继子
and Johnny Iselin's stepson.

819
01:05:14,477 --> 01:05:15,774
这就是她
That's her.

820
01:05:18,314 --> 01:05:19,440
Jocie
Jocie.

821
01:05:22,051 --> 01:05:25,487
- 她很可爱
- 我一直留着她的照片
- She's lovely.
- I always keep her picture.

822
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:33,824
几年后我认识到，Ben，
Years later, I realized,
Ben, that...

823
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:38,501
我不是个讨人喜欢的人
不，别反驳我
I'm not very lovable.
No, don't contradict me.

824
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:40,569
我不讨人喜欢
I am not lovable.

825
01:05:40,569 --> 01:05:44,607
有些人很讨人喜欢但有些人不是
Some people are lovable,
and other people are not lovable.

826
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:47,599
我不是个讨人喜欢的人
I am not lovable.

827
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:52,648
但我跟Jocie在一起时，我就变成了讨人喜欢的人
But I was very lovable
with Jocie.

828
01:05:53,683 --> 01:05:57,753
你不会相信我能变得多讨人喜欢
You can not believe
how lovable I was.

829
01:05:57,753 --> 01:05:59,152
在某种程度上
In a way.

830
01:06:00,756 --> 01:06:03,919
但是，我母亲把这一切都改变了
Then, of course,
my mother fixed all that.

831
01:06:06,762 --> 01:06:10,299
Ben，你不会因为我恨自己的母亲
而责怪我吧？
Ben, you don't blame me
for hating my mother, do you?

832
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:13,035
我不是在找借口...
I'm not making excuses...

833
01:06:13,035 --> 01:06:16,706
但在那事儿发生后...
but I have been even less lovable...

834
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:20,039
我确实变得比原来更不讨人喜欢了
than I was since.

835
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:27,116
那是我入伍前的最后一个夏天
It was the summer just before
I went into the army...

836
01:06:27,116 --> 01:06:30,210
我被蛇咬了
and I was bitten by this snake.

837
01:06:32,555 --> 01:06:36,359
- 你在听吗？
- 听着呢
- Are you following me?
- I am.

838
01:06:36,359 --> 01:06:40,663
我当时无助地躺在地上，完全无助
While I was lying there,
absolutely helpless...

839
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:43,766
还不敢动，因为被蛇咬了，
我不能动...
afraid to move, because
you're not supposed to move...

840
01:06:43,766 --> 01:06:48,499
一动就会加快毒素扩散
it makes the poison circulate...

841
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:55,511
然而，没想到，
when, unexpectedly,
there she was...

842
01:06:55,511 --> 01:06:57,780
她拿出了剃刀刀片
with a razor blade in her hand.

843
01:06:57,780 --> 01:07:00,549
我爸会很开心的
My daddy's going to be
so pleased about this.

844
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:04,487
我是说，他很害怕乡下的毒蛇
I mean, he's absolutely scared about
snakes in this part of the country.

845
01:07:04,487 --> 01:07:08,858
我知道这听起来很弗洛伊德，但在我爸这个案例上，
我不觉得它是弗洛伊德型的案例
I know that sounds terribly Freudian,
but in this case, I don't think it is.

846
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:13,562
我觉得他只是单纯地害怕蛇，并且还是周期性的
I think he's just simply and uncomplicatedly
afraid of snakes, period...

847
01:07:13,562 --> 01:07:16,399
这就是为什么我骑车还碰巧带着剃刀刀片...
which is why I happen to be
riding around with a razorblade...

848
01:07:16,399 --> 01:07:19,702
和高锰酸钾溶液的原因
and a bottle of potassium
permanganate solution.

849
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:22,304
你不会碰巧也带着块儿手帕吧？
You don't happen to have
a handkerchief, do you?

850
01:07:22,304 --> 01:07:24,329
不，当然了，你不会带
No, of course, you don't.

851
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:29,278
我也没带，我带着面巾纸，不过...
I don't either.
I do have a Kleenex.

852
01:07:29,278 --> 01:07:35,513
讲真，我爸看见这场面会吓坏的
Seriously, Daddy is going to be
just thrilled about this.

853
01:07:37,186 --> 01:07:39,588
整个夏天他都在胡说有蛇，
All summer long,
he's been raving about snakes...

854
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:42,148
没看到过那怕一条，但现在有了
and nobody's even seen one,
and now this.

855
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:46,228
我向你保证，被蛇咬可能让你觉得不爽，
I promise you,
it may be uncomfortable for you...

856
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:48,764
但这让我爸的夏天圆满了
but it's going to absolutely
make his summer.

857
01:07:48,764 --> 01:07:51,033
现在你慢慢躺下，千万别动
Now you just lie very still.
Don't move.

858
01:07:51,033 --> 01:07:52,601
这很重要
That's very important.

859
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:54,967
我很快开车回来接你
I'll be right back with the car
in a minute.

860
01:08:04,780 --> 01:08:06,682
你很幸运，年轻人，非常幸运
You're lucky,
young man, very lucky.

861
01:08:06,682 --> 01:08:11,483
如果我告诉你每年有多少人被蛇咬致死...
If I were to tell you the statistics
on death by snake bite every year...

862
01:08:12,788 --> 01:08:17,748
但看你身上，我觉得...
上面和下面都没有肿
But in this case, I think...
There's no swelling above or below.

863
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:28,370
体温正常
Normal.

864
01:08:28,370 --> 01:08:31,430
我得说，你会活下来的
I must say, there's a good chance
you're going to live.

865
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:37,808
你不会是个哑巴吧？
You are not, by any chance,
a mute, are you?

866
01:08:44,153 --> 01:08:46,889
我得好好地感谢你，你叫...
I want to thank you
very much, Miss...

867
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:50,459
- Jordan
- Jocelyn Jordan小姐
- Jordan.
- Miss Jocelyn Jordan.

868
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:52,654
- 你好
- 你好
- How do you do?
- Hi.

869
01:08:54,196 --> 01:08:58,200
现在，根据本地习俗...
And now, according to
the quaint local custom...

870
01:08:58,200 --> 01:09:02,204
- 该你告诉我们你叫什么了
- 先生，我叫Raymond Shaw
- it's your turn to tell us what your name is.
- My name is Raymond Shaw, sir.

871
01:09:02,204 --> 01:09:03,672
你好，Raymond
How do you do, Raymond?

872
01:09:03,672 --> 01:09:05,641
你的住处在这附近吗？
Is your place near here?

873
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:08,711
是的，湖对面那栋红房子就是
Yes, it's that red house
just across the lake.

874
01:09:08,711 --> 01:09:11,580
- Iselin家的房子？
- 是我的房子
- The Iselin house?
- My house.

875
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:14,984
那是我爸的，我爸死了，他把房子留给了我
It was my father's.
My father's dead, he left it to me.

876
01:09:14,984 --> 01:09:18,587
我们听说那是Iselin参议员的夏季别墅
We were told that that was
the summer camp of Sen. Iselin.

877
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:21,190
先生，Johnny有时会过来呆一会儿...
Johnny stays there sometimes, sir.

878
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:24,990
当他喝得烂醉时，我妈不允许他在华盛顿被别人看见喝的烂醉
When he gets too drunk for my mother
to allow him to be seen in Washington.

879
01:09:27,496 --> 01:09:31,033
亲爱的，我们已经做了所有现代科学建议我们做的...
My dear, although we've done everything
that modern science recommends...

880
01:09:31,033 --> 01:09:36,272
但还是有一些传统的民间的治蛇咬伤的方法，我们还没试
there's still the traditional folk remedy
against snake bite, which we haven't applied.

881
01:09:36,272 --> 01:09:38,570
因此，为了安全起见...
So, to be on the safe side...

882
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:45,744
- Iselin太太是你的母亲？
- 是的，先生
- Mrs. Iselin is your mother?
- Yes, sir.

883
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:50,719
我曾觉得有必要起诉你的母亲，
并且起诉了她...
I once found it necessary
to sue your mother...

884
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:54,490
因为她诽谤中伤我的人格
for defamation of character
and slander.

885
01:09:54,490 --> 01:09:58,187
我是Thomas Jordan
参议员Thomas Jordan
My name is Thomas Jordan.
Sen. Thomas Jordan.

886
01:09:59,228 --> 01:10:00,889
那个共产党员？
The Communist?

887
01:10:04,133 --> 01:10:07,469
你妈妈有一个很可爱的特点...
One of your mother's
more endearing traits...

888
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:11,073
她喜欢把和她政见不同的人称为...
is hertendency to referto anyone
who disagrees with her about anything...

889
01:10:11,073 --> 01:10:13,342
共产党员
as a Communist.

890
01:10:13,342 --> 01:10:17,680
上一次她在一个广播节目中这么叫我...
The last time she so referred to me
on a network radio program...

891
01:10:17,680 --> 01:10:21,810
让她交了六万五千块罚款还有诉讼费
it cost her $ 65,000
and court costs.

892
01:10:22,851 --> 01:10:25,821
比起罚款，我觉得...
What hurt her more
than the money, I think...

893
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:27,690
我把这笔钱捐给了美国民权同盟...
was the fact that I donated it...

894
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:31,820
这个做法伤她更深
to an organization called
the American Civil Liberties Union.

895
01:10:35,030 --> 01:10:38,625
- Jordan参议员？
- 说吧，Raymond
- Sen. Jordan?
- Yes, Raymond.

896
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:44,502
我请求你允许我娶你的女儿
I would very much like to ask
your permission to marry Jocelyn.

897
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:05,418
之后我们每一分钟都在一起
We were together every
minute after that.

898
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:11,729
你不会相信的，Ben...
You just can not believe, Ben...

899
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:15,369
你不会相信这整件事有多甜蜜
how lovable the whole
damn thing was.

900
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:20,575
整个夏天我们都在一起，
All summer long, we were together.

901
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:24,337
我那时很可爱...
I was lovable...

902
01:11:25,981 --> 01:11:27,846
Jocie很可爱...
Jocie was lovable...

903
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:31,353
参议员很可爱...
the Senator was lovable...

904
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:34,254
白天很可爱,晚上也很可爱...
the days were lovable,
the nights were lovable...

905
01:11:36,959 --> 01:11:39,189
每个人都很可爱...
and everybody was lovable.

906
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:43,659
除了，当然...
Except, of course...

907
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:46,224
我的母亲
my mother.

908
01:11:52,841 --> 01:11:54,677
什么事，妈？
What is it, Mother?

909
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:56,979
你凌晨三点半出去见谁了？
What sort of a greeting
is that at 3:30 a.m?

910
01:11:56,979 --> 01:12:00,380
- 是两点四十五，你想干嘛？
- 我想跟你谈谈，Raymond
- It's 2:45 and what do you want?
- I want to talk to you, Raymond.

911
01:12:01,417 --> 01:12:03,118
谈什么？
About what?

912
01:12:03,118 --> 01:12:07,156
- 谈谈那个共产党婊子
- 闭嘴吧，妈，闭嘴！ 
- About that Communist tart.
- Shut up，mother，shut up！

913
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:10,092
你知道Jordan是什么人吗？
你是想公开羞辱我吗？
Do you know what Jordan is?
Are you out to crucify me?

914
01:12:10,092 --> 01:12:12,828
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know
what you're talking about.

915
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:14,159
我要睡觉了
I'm going to bed.

916
01:12:15,197 --> 01:12:16,357
Raymond，坐下
Raymond, sit down.

917
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:30,212
你以后怎么见她？他们住在纽约
How would you see her?
They live in New York.

918
01:12:30,212 --> 01:12:32,381
我会去纽约找份工作
I'm getting a job in New York.

919
01:12:32,381 --> 01:12:35,718
- 你要去服兵役
- 服兵役
- You have your army service.
- Next spring.

920
01:12:35,718 --> 01:12:37,982
我可能没服完兵役就死了
I might be dead by next spring.

921
01:12:39,688 --> 01:12:41,457
Raymond，如果我们和苏联开战了...
Raymond, if we were at war...

922
01:12:41,457 --> 01:12:45,527
而你却迷上了一个苏联特务的女儿...
and you suddenly became infatuated
with the daughter of a Russian agent...

923
01:12:45,527 --> 01:12:48,163
你难道不会希望我来找你，反对你，
wouldn't you expect me
to come to you and object...

924
01:12:48,163 --> 01:12:51,834
求你在一切太迟之前停下你那疯狂的爱吗？
and beg you to stop the entire thing
before it was too late?

925
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:53,702
然而，我们已经开战了
Well, we are at war.

926
01:12:53,702 --> 01:12:55,437
是冷战
It's a cold war...

927
01:12:55,437 --> 01:13:00,142
但会越来越严重的，直到这个国家的每个男人，
每个女人，每个儿童，
but it will get worse, until every
man, woman and child in this country...

928
01:13:00,142 --> 01:13:02,177
都不得不站起来，表明自己...
will have to stand up
and be counted...

929
01:13:02,177 --> 01:13:04,747
是站在权利和自由这边，
to say whether they are
on the side of right and freedom...

930
01:13:04,747 --> 01:13:08,150
还是站在Thomas Jordan的国家那边
or on the side of
the Thomas Jordans of this country.

931
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:11,186
我明天就和你一起去华盛顿...
I will go with you to Washington,
tomorrow, if you like...

932
01:13:11,186 --> 01:13:14,456
如果你想，我会给你看证据，
证明这个男人是站在邪恶那边的
and I will show you proof
that this man stands for evil.

933
01:13:14,456 --> 01:13:16,158
证明他是个邪恶的人
That he is evil.

934
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:20,596
他穷尽一生，在暗中损害你和我的，
And that his whole life is devoted to
undermining everything that you and I...

935
01:13:20,596 --> 01:13:23,465
Johnny的，每个有自由思想的美国人的
生活中的所有东西
and Johnny
and every freedom-minded American...

936
01:13:23,465 --> 01:13:25,228
她赢了，当然
She won, of course.

937
01:13:26,268 --> 01:13:28,168
她总是赢的那一个
She always does.

938
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:30,963
我永远没法打败她
I could never beat her.

939
01:13:33,275 --> 01:13:35,140
现在也做不到
I still can't.

940
01:13:39,848 --> 01:13:41,281
我写了封信...
I wrote a letter...

941
01:13:42,885 --> 01:13:46,480
或者是她写的，我签的名，
我记不清了
or she wrote it and I signed it,
I can't even remember which.

942
01:13:49,024 --> 01:13:54,485
那是封可怕的，卑鄙的，恶心的信
It was a terrible, vile,
disgusting letter.

943
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:02,635
第二天我就入伍了
The next day,
I enlisted in the army.

944
01:14:06,442 --> 01:14:08,239
我再也没见过她
I never saw her again.

945
01:14:10,646 --> 01:14:12,511
有些事只有上帝知道，Ben...
God knows, Ben...

946
01:14:14,016 --> 01:14:15,711
我不讨人喜欢
I'm not lovable.

947
01:14:17,453 --> 01:14:19,250
但我爱她
But I loved her.

948
01:14:20,322 --> 01:14:24,452
我爱她，我现在仍然爱着她
I did love her.
I do love her.

949
01:14:32,901 --> 01:14:37,099
行了，孩子，我送你上床吧 
Come on, kid.
Time for you to call it a night.

950
01:14:41,910 --> 01:14:44,480
所以我对我那个讨厌的姐夫说...
So this lousy brother-in-law of mine,
I say to him...

951
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:47,950
- “你觉得你扑克玩的好？但我记得... 
- 来杯啤酒
- ‘You think you're a poker player?
Well, I got a flash for you.
- Beer

952
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:50,510
你玩的不好啊"
（注：此处扑克有赌博性质）
You ain't no poker player.'

953
01:14:52,187 --> 01:14:54,189
于是我对他说
So I says to him

954
01:14:54,189 --> 01:14:58,393
“我给你个发自内心的忠告...
'My advice to you,
from the bottom of the heart...

955
01:14:58,393 --> 01:15:00,418
别玩扑克
don't play poker.

956
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:06,468
如果我是你，我会玩点别的类型的
If I was you, I'd get myself
another line of action.

957
01:15:06,468 --> 01:15:11,240
为什么不玩玩单人纸牌打发时间呢？”
Why don't you pass the time
by playing a little solitaire? '

958
01:15:11,240 --> 01:15:13,970
- 然后他说...
- 请给我一副牌
- So he says...
- Give me a deck of cards, please.

959
01:15:22,484 --> 01:15:24,686
当我和我老婆结婚时，我不明白...
When I got married to my old lady,
I got no idea that this guy...

960
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:30,359
为什么这个人也跟着住进我家，
原来这是个一揽子买卖
comes in the same package,
that it's a package deal.

961
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:35,831
11年了，这个问题一直困扰着我
For 11 long years,
I got this crumb tied around my neck.

962
01:15:35,831 --> 01:15:42,070
- 相信我，这交易可不便宜
- 请来杯啤酒
- Believe me, it's no bargain.
- A beer, please.

963
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:45,307
抱歉我迟到了孩子
路上很堵
Sorry I'm late, kid.
Got held up in traffic.

964
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:47,910
于是我对他说：“你能帮我个忙吗？
So I says to him,
'Do me a favor, will you?

965
01:15:47,910 --> 01:15:53,115
你为什么不出去打辆车，去中央公园...
Why don't you go and take yourself
a cab and go up to Central Park...

966
01:15:53,115 --> 01:15:55,777
然后跳湖里呢？”
and go jump in the lake? '

967
01:17:42,057 --> 01:17:43,456
快上来
Get out of there.

968
01:17:45,160 --> 01:17:46,559
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

969
01:17:49,931 --> 01:17:50,932
你好，Ben
Hi, Ben.

970
01:17:50,932 --> 01:17:54,136
你在干嘛？你疯了吗？
What the hell are you doing?
What's the matter with you?

971
01:17:54,136 --> 01:17:55,626
我不知道
I don't know.

972
01:17:57,105 --> 01:18:01,371
我刚才和你一起在酒吧里，
你在玩单人纸牌，你记得吗？
I was next to you at the bar,
you were playing solitaire. Do you remember that？

973
01:18:04,413 --> 01:18:07,182
然后你突然冲出酒吧，打了辆车来公园...
Then you bolted out of the bar,
took a cab to the park...

974
01:18:07,182 --> 01:18:08,917
然后跳进了湖里
and jumped into the water.

975
01:18:08,917 --> 01:18:11,186
我什么都不记得了，Ben
I don't remember, Ben.

976
01:18:11,186 --> 01:18:13,055
我就是想不起来发生了什么
I just don't remember.

977
01:18:13,055 --> 01:18:14,990
等一下，我想起来点什么
Wait a minute, I do.
I remember.

978
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:18,994
梦里的一些事
In the dream.

979
01:18:18,994 --> 01:18:21,360
我想起来你在梦里干了些什么了
I remember what you were doing
with your hands.

980
01:18:22,631 --> 01:18:26,465
你在...原来是这样！
You were... Of course.

981
01:18:28,804 --> 01:18:33,308
很明显，单人纸牌游戏是某种东西的触发机制
Obviously, the solitaire game serves
as some kind of trigger mechanism.

982
01:18:33,308 --> 01:18:35,401
把黑7放红8上
Black 7 on the red 8.

983
01:18:38,246 --> 01:18:42,818
我建议放弃数字牌，集中精力研究花牌
I suggest we discard the various number
systems and concentrate on the face cards.

984
01:18:42,818 --> 01:18:45,220
- 红6放黑7上
- 非常感谢
- Red 6 on the black 7.
- Thanks a lot.

985
01:18:45,220 --> 01:18:48,957
因为花牌象征着人类
Because of their symbolic
identification with human beings.

986
01:18:48,957 --> 01:18:53,962
基于对Raymond的精神病模式分析，我们可以
安全地排除杰克和国王
Based on Raymond's psychiatric pattern,
we can safely eliminate jacks and kings.

987
01:18:53,962 --> 01:18:56,465
黑6放红7上
Black 6 on the red 7.

988
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:58,956
还是你玩吧
Why don't you try it for a while?

989
01:19:01,470 --> 01:19:04,473
人鱼在大气海洋的底部游泳，
Human fish swimming at the bottom
of the ocean of atmosphere...

990
01:19:04,473 --> 01:19:08,877
当他们和另外的人鱼相撞，就会产生精神伤害
develop psychic injuries
as they collide with one another.

991
01:19:08,877 --> 01:19:10,879
大多数凡人...
Most mortal of all...

992
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:13,848
是继承了上一辈的残留的那些人
are those gotten
from the parent fish.

993
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:17,684
方块女王放在黑国王上
Queen of Diamonds on the black king.

994
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:22,257
嘿，你在干嘛？
Hey, what are you doing?

995
01:19:22,257 --> 01:19:25,522
- 在单人纸牌游戏里作弊是退化的一种方式
- 我想起来了
- To cheat at solitaire is a form of regression.
- I remember.

996
01:19:26,561 --> 01:19:28,461
我想起来了
I remember.

997
01:19:30,132 --> 01:19:35,036
我能看见一个中国人在那儿站着，
笑起来像傅满洲
I can see that Chinese cat
standing there smiling like Fu Manchu...

998
01:19:35,036 --> 01:19:41,576
还说：“方片女王可以通过多种方式...
and saying, 'The Queen of Diamonds
is reminiscent in many ways...

999
01:19:41,576 --> 01:19:44,704
让Raymond想起他那让他又爱又恨的母亲...
of Raymond's dearly loved
and hated mother... '

1000
01:19:45,881 --> 01:19:50,485
这是触发让他进行任何种类任务的机制...
and is the second key
to clear the mechanism... '

1001
01:19:50,485 --> 01:19:53,318
的第二把钥匙”
for any other assignment.'

1002
01:19:56,057 --> 01:19:59,461
...我们伟大的共和国，我重复一遍，共和国...
'... our great republic, repeat, republic... '

1003
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:02,230
直到把国际共产主义的危险...
'until the peril
of international Communism... '

1004
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:05,688
从这个伟大的国家里驱逐出去，
甚至从这个国家每一个黑暗的角落里驱逐出去
'is driven from every dark corner
of this great nation.'

1005
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:09,404
再给我弄弄下巴
Give me a little chucky
under the chin.

1006
01:20:09,404 --> 01:20:12,307
我好担心Raymond
I can't tell you how worried
I am， about Raymond.

1007
01:20:12,307 --> 01:20:17,212
- Raymond？谁啊？
- Raymond Shaw，我儿子，你的继子
- Raymond? What Raymond?
- Raymond Shaw. My son. Your stepson.

1008
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:20,015
我一直在想他，你知道我决定要干嘛吗？
I've been thinking about him,
and you know what I've decided?

1009
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:22,848
- 你要干嘛？
- 我觉得是时候让他结婚了
- What?
- I've decided it's time he got married.

1010
01:20:24,586 --> 01:20:27,489
我能问你什么事这么好笑吗？
May I ask what you find
so amusing?

1011
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:31,560
你能找谁？谁会嫁给Raymond啊？
Who could you possibly find，
who would marry Raymond?

1012
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,930
我已经仔细考虑过这个问题了
I have devoted considerable thought
to the problem.

1013
01:20:34,930 --> 01:20:38,733
我想到了Tom Jordan的女儿，Jocelyn
It has occurred to me
that Tom Jordan's daughter Jocelyn...

1014
01:20:38,733 --> 01:20:39,868
你记得吗亲爱的...
you remember her, hon...

1015
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:44,105
那年夏天，在湖边，把Raymond迷的不要不要的
那个跟老鼠似的女孩？
that mousy little girl Raymond was so
attracted to that summer at the lake?

1016
01:20:44,105 --> 01:20:47,404
- 那个小共产党婊子？
- 对！
- That little 'Communist tart'?
- All right!

1017
01:20:48,977 --> 01:20:50,812
- 我当时可能有点草率了
- 发际线这边再刮一下
- I may have been hasty.
- A little in the hair line.

1018
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:55,016
然而，时代变了，我现在认为她会成为
Raymond的好妻子
Anyway, times change. I now think
she would make Raymond an excellent wife.

1019
01:20:55,016 --> 01:20:57,619
她过去两年都住在巴黎
She's been living in Paris
for the past two years.

1020
01:20:57,619 --> 01:20:59,721
我听说她快要回来了
I have word she'll be
coming home soon.

1021
01:20:59,721 --> 01:21:04,226
等她回来了，我想我们应该开个小聚会
When she does, I think we should
give a little party.

1022
01:21:04,226 --> 01:21:07,062
但是，宝贝儿，我觉得你和Jordan参议员...
But, babe, I thought
that you and Sen. Jordan...

1023
01:21:07,062 --> 01:21:10,265
我告诉过你不要思考
I keep telling you not to think.

1024
01:21:10,265 --> 01:21:12,500
你在很多方面都很行...
You're very, very good
at a great many things...

1025
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:16,271
但是思考，亲爱的，不是你擅长的事
but thinking, hon,
just simply isn't one of them.

1026
01:21:16,271 --> 01:21:19,074
你只要对着电视镜头不断地喊“注意议事程序”就行了
You just keep shouting, 'Point of order,'
into the television cameras...

1027
01:21:19,074 --> 01:21:23,044
其他的事我会处理
and I'll handle the rest.

1028
01:21:23,044 --> 01:21:26,648
- 我觉得在六月办婚礼不错
- 威士忌，加水
- I think a June wedding would be nice.
- Bourbon, water.

1029
01:21:26,648 --> 01:21:29,515
正好在大选之前
Right before the convention.

1030
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:34,322
我不明白为什么你的公寓...
I don't know why yours is
the only apartment in New York City...

1031
01:21:34,322 --> 01:21:35,690
是全纽约唯一一间没有空调的公寓
without an air conditioner.

1032
01:21:35,690 --> 01:21:39,127
有时候我觉得你是从另一个世纪来的
Sometimes I think you came to us
from another century.

1033
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:41,463
春秋瞅？不管你名字怎么念了...
Chu-chin-chow,
or whatever your name is...

1034
01:21:41,463 --> 01:21:44,132
牛排必须两面各烤11分钟...
the steaks are to be broiled
for exactly 11 minutes...

1035
01:21:44,132 --> 01:21:49,638
不能多也不能少，还要放在400度预热的烤架上
no more, no less, on each side
in a preheated grill at 400 degrees.

1036
01:21:49,638 --> 01:21:51,940
好的，太太
Yes, ma'am.

1037
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:53,642
妈，我能问个问题吗？
Mother, may I ask a question?

1038
01:21:53,642 --> 01:21:55,310
当然
Of course.

1039
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:56,745
你在这儿干嘛？
What are you doing here?

1040
01:21:56,745 --> 01:21:59,180
我是说，为什么我们现在要进行“年会”？
一年见你一次我也不愿意
I mean，why are we having our annual meeting?

1041
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:01,316
我不明白你在说什么
I don't know what
you're talking about.

1042
01:22:01,316 --> 01:22:04,019
当我收到你要来吃午饭的消息时，
When I got your message,
announcing you were coming for lunch...

1043
01:22:04,019 --> 01:22:06,521
我自然地想到，你是想来干点什么
I naturally assumed
you wanted something.

1044
01:22:06,521 --> 01:22:10,355
当然不是，这只是个纯粹的社交活动，然而...
Not at all. This is a purely
social event. However...

1045
01:22:11,393 --> 01:22:13,028
哈！“然而”这个词好
Ha！“However”.

1046
01:22:13,028 --> 01:22:17,332
不知道你听没听说，Johnny和我要举办一个盛大的派对
As you may or may not have heard,
Johnny and I are giving an enormous party.

1047
01:22:17,332 --> 01:22:21,303
实际上，是个化妆舞会，在我们在长岛的度夏别墅
A costume ball, actually,
at the summer house on Long Island.

1048
01:22:21,303 --> 01:22:23,498
我想知道你是否会出席
I wondered if you'd like to attend?

1049
01:22:25,140 --> 01:22:27,108
你没疯吧，我会去吗？
Have you gone out of your mind?

1050
01:22:28,209 --> 01:22:32,447
我问你是因为这个聚会是为了你的一位老朋友而办的...
The reason I ask is because we're giving it
in honor of an old friend of yours...

1051
01:22:32,447 --> 01:22:33,949
还有他的女儿
and her father.

1052
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:35,439
哪个老朋友？
What old friend?

1053
01:22:36,484 --> 01:22:39,788
你还记得入伍前我们遇到过的那个可爱的女孩吗？
Do you remember a darling girl we met
before you went into the army?

1054
01:22:39,788 --> 01:22:42,891
Jocelyn Jordan，Jordan参议员的女儿？
Jocelyn Jordan,
Sen. Jordan's daughter?

1055
01:22:42,891 --> 01:22:46,294
她近几年都在国外侨居
She's been living abroad
for the last several years.

1056
01:22:46,294 --> 01:22:49,331
大约一个周之前回到了纽约
She arrived back in New York
a week or so ago.

1057
01:22:49,331 --> 01:22:50,832
然后我想...
And I thought...

1058
01:22:50,832 --> 01:22:53,935
考虑到你曾那么卑鄙地对待她...
considering the rather shabby way
you treated her...

1059
01:22:53,935 --> 01:22:58,804
如果我给她举行个欢迎派对会是个友好的信号
it might be a rather gracious gesture
if I gave her a coming-home party.

1060
01:23:00,175 --> 01:23:02,166
Jocie和她爸...
Jocie and her father...

1061
01:23:04,546 --> 01:23:06,381
要去你们举办的派对？
coming to a party of yours?

1062
01:23:06,381 --> 01:23:07,749
当然...
Of course...

1063
01:23:07,749 --> 01:23:09,910
只要我跟她说你也会去
once I explained to her
you would be there.

1064
01:23:18,293 --> 01:23:20,193
没事儿，这是波兰鱼子酱
It's all right,
it's Polish caviar.

1065
01:23:21,229 --> 01:23:23,288
Johnny，过来，亲爱的
Johnny, come over here, hon.

1066
01:23:30,605 --> 01:23:31,799
你站中间
You stand in the middle.

1067
01:23:35,110 --> 01:23:37,203
- 谢谢，过会儿见
- 你看起来真美
- Thank you. See you later.
- You look marvelous.

1068
01:23:42,417 --> 01:23:45,653
- 她在哪儿？来了吗？
- 他们马上到
- Where is she? Have they come?
- They'll be here any minute.

1069
01:23:45,653 --> 01:23:47,956
妈，你确定他们会来吗？
百分之百确定？
Are you sure they're coming, Mother?
Absolutely sure?

1070
01:23:47,956 --> 01:23:49,858
Raymond，别像个傻瓜一样
Raymond, don't be such a jerk.

1071
01:23:49,858 --> 01:23:53,528
去拿杯喝的，要不就吃片安定
Go and get yourself a drink
or a tranquilizer or something.

1072
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:55,830
Raymond肯定会变成让别人引以为戒的惨痛教训的
Raymond can certainly be a royal pain.

1073
01:23:55,830 --> 01:24:00,435
她在开玩笑，你看起来很棒，很棒！
She's just kidding.
You look great. Just great!

1074
01:24:00,435 --> 01:24:03,836
你在扮什么？某个荷兰滑冰选手？
What are you supposed to be,
one of those Dutch skaters?

1075
01:24:05,273 --> 01:24:07,002
Raymond，亲爱的...
Raymond, darling...

1076
01:24:08,209 --> 01:24:12,914
为什么你总是看起来很严肃紧张呢？
Why must you always look as if
your head's about to come to a point?

1077
01:24:12,914 --> 01:24:17,442
耐心点，她会来的，我保证
Now just be patient, and she'll be here.
I guarantee it.

1078
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:23,091
Raymond，咱们到处溜达一会儿...
Raymond, why don't we just sneak away
for a few minutes...

1079
01:24:23,091 --> 01:24:25,958
然后找个地方坐下来安静地喝杯酒怎么样？
and sit down somewhere quietly
and have a drink?

1080
01:24:27,228 --> 01:24:29,431
你百分之百确定她会来，是吧，妈？
Are you absolutely sure
she's coming, Mother?

1081
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:34,266
我跟你说了，她几分钟前从旅馆给我打电话了，会来
I told you, she telephoned me
minutes ago from the hotel.

1082
01:24:36,171 --> 01:24:40,574
- 妈，她听起来怎么样？
- 听起来像个女孩儿
- Mother, how did she sound?
- Like a girl.

1083
01:24:44,979 --> 01:24:48,437
你玩会儿单人纸牌游戏打发打发时间好吗？
Why don't you pass the time
by playing a little solitaire?

1084
01:24:56,091 --> 01:24:58,993
Tom老弟，你能来真是太好了
Tom boy, so great you could come.

1085
01:24:58,993 --> 01:25:02,097
我会来这个法西斯集会...
I am here at this fascist rally...

1086
01:25:02,097 --> 01:25:04,032
只是因为我的女儿告诉我...
because my daughter has assured me...

1087
01:25:04,032 --> 01:25:08,069
这对她的幸福很重要，所以我来了
that it was important to her happiness
that I come.

1088
01:25:08,069 --> 01:25:10,772
再没有其他原因
There is no other reason.

1089
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:12,364
好心的Tom老弟
Good old Tom.

1090
01:25:19,814 --> 01:25:22,942
时间到了，咱们得好好谈谈
The time has come for us to have
a serious discussion.

1091
01:25:23,985 --> 01:25:26,821
我们觉得...谁啊？
We feel... What is it?

1092
01:25:26,821 --> 01:25:29,858
是我，宝贝儿，Johnny，
Tom Jordan来了，我需要你
It's me, babe, Johnny.
Tom Jordan's here. I need you.

1093
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:31,626
我过会儿就出去！
I'll be right out!

1094
01:25:31,626 --> 01:25:34,929
- 你和谁在里面啊？
- Raymond！
- Who's in there with you, anyway?
- Raymond!

1095
01:25:34,929 --> 01:25:37,864
快点儿好吗？外面还有工作呢
Hurry it up, will you?
We've got work to do out here.

1096
01:25:42,237 --> 01:25:46,367
- 我会拿着这张的，亲爱的，留在这儿会出事的
- 好的
- I'll take this one with me, dear.
It might be mischief if I leave it.
- Yes.

1097
01:25:51,846 --> 01:25:53,837
我很快就回来
I'll be back as soon as I can.

1098
01:26:10,565 --> 01:26:13,501
我一直在窗外看着你，
I've been watching you through the window.

1099
01:26:13,501 --> 01:26:17,205
当我看着你时，我的心都要跳出来了
When I saw you, my heart almost
shot out of my body.

1100
01:26:17,205 --> 01:26:20,008
我让爸爸去前门，
I sent Daddy around the front way.

1101
01:26:20,008 --> 01:26:21,908
我想一个人看着你
I had to see you alone.

1102
01:27:11,593 --> 01:27:12,992
走吧，亲爱的
Come on, lover.

1103
01:27:14,095 --> 01:27:19,834
- 你为什么不拿着这杯酒找个地方安安静静地喝呢？
- 但是，亲爱的...
- Why don't you just take that somewhere
very quietly and drink it?
- But，hon...

1104
01:27:19,834 --> 01:27:23,463
好啦，亲爱的，快去吧，
成年人要开始会谈了
All right, dear, run along.
The grownups have to talk.

1105
01:27:32,313 --> 01:27:34,382
你能来真好，Tom
How good of you to come, Tom.

1106
01:27:34,382 --> 01:27:37,485
我跟你丈夫解释过我来的原因了
I have explained to your husband
why I am here.

1107
01:27:37,485 --> 01:27:43,091
我知道你对我和Johnny有很大的偏见
I know you have strong personal
feelings about Johnny and I.

1108
01:27:43,091 --> 01:27:46,494
我想知道这种偏见到底有多大
What I would like to find out is
how strong they really are.

1109
01:27:46,494 --> 01:27:48,663
简单地说吧...
To put it as simply as possible...

1110
01:27:48,663 --> 01:27:51,933
如果下周的竞选中Johnny被提名了...
If Johnny's name were put forward
at the convention next week...

1111
01:27:51,933 --> 01:27:53,935
你会试图阻止他吗？
would you attempt to block him?

1112
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:55,637
你一定是在开玩笑
You're joking, of course.

1113
01:27:55,637 --> 01:27:59,007
Stevenson先生会开玩笑，我不会
Mr. Stevenson makes jokes. I do not.

1114
01:27:59,007 --> 01:28:02,543
你真的在帮Johnny争取提名吗？
You're seriously trying
for the nomination for Johnny?

1115
01:28:02,543 --> 01:28:03,911
不，我们做不到
No. We couldn't make it.

1116
01:28:03,911 --> 01:28:07,148
但我觉得他有很大的机会获得第二提名，得到候补机会
But I think he has a good chance
for the second spot.

1117
01:28:07,148 --> 01:28:09,951
我回答了你的问题，你还没回答我的
I've answered your question,
but you haven't answered mine.

1118
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:13,182 
- 什么问题？
- 你会阻止我们吗？
- What question?
- Will you block us?

1119
01:28:15,023 --> 01:28:16,957
我会阻止你们吗？
Will I block you?

1120
01:28:18,126 --> 01:28:23,655
我会花掉我的每一分钱，然后再借我能借到的所有钱，
都用来阻止你们
I would spend every cent I own
and all I could borrow to block you.

1121
01:28:25,733 --> 01:28:30,071
有人认为Johnny是个小丑，是个弄臣
There are people who think of Johnny
as a clown and a buffoon.

1122
01:28:30,071 --> 01:28:32,106
但我不这么认为，
But I do not.

1123
01:28:32,106 --> 01:28:34,309
我鄙视John Iselin...
I despise John Iselin...

1124
01:28:34,309 --> 01:28:38,446
和所有他的政治主张中支持的东西
and everything that Iselinism
has come to stand for.

1125
01:28:38,446 --> 01:28:41,949
我觉得如果John Iselin是个苏联特务的话
I think if John Iselin
were a paid Soviet agent...

1126
01:28:41,949 --> 01:28:45,749
他所做的也不会比他现在所做的，伤害这个国家更深了
he could not do more to harm this country
than he is doing now.

1127
01:28:47,188 --> 01:28:49,891
你问了我一个问题...
You asked me a question...

1128
01:28:49,891 --> 01:28:52,093
好的，我这就回答你
very well,
I'll answer you.

1129
01:28:52,093 --> 01:28:55,196
如果你试图跟代表们走关系...
If you attempt to deal
with the delegates...

1130
01:28:55,196 --> 01:28:58,800
或者试图让Johnny获得提名...
or cause Johnny's name
to be brought forward on the ticket...

1131
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:04,806
又或者明天早上我和代表们通话时，我发现你为竞选一直没闲着...
or if in my canvass of the delegates
I find that you are acting...

1132
01:29:04,806 --> 01:29:07,909
我会在美国参议院开会时...
I will bring impeachment proceedings
against your husband...

1133
01:29:07,909 --> 01:29:10,978
弹劾你的丈夫
on the floor of the United
States Senate.

1134
01:29:10,978 --> 01:29:13,715
我会把他打趴下的，我保证...
And I will hit him, I promise you...

1135
01:29:13,715 --> 01:29:18,379
用我那记得满满的档案薄
with everything in my
well-documented book.

1136
01:29:39,440 --> 01:29:42,744
抽张牌，赌一百万我能猜到是什么
For $ 1 million, pick a card.

1137
01:29:42,744 --> 01:29:47,044
- 纸牌把戏，要是我知道...
- 抽一张
- Card tricks. If I know that...
- Pick a card.

1138
01:29:50,918 --> 01:29:52,749
是方块皇后
The Queen of Diamonds.

1139
01:29:54,222 --> 01:29:56,690
不错啊，你怎么做到的？
That's pretty good.
How did you do that?

1140
01:29:58,126 --> 01:30:01,391
这就是奥秘，亲爱的，整副牌都是骗人的
This is what is known, my dear girl,
as a forced deck.

1141
01:30:03,297 --> 01:30:07,435
职业魔术师经常使用这种牌，
This deck of cards is often employed
by a professional magician...

1142
01:30:07,435 --> 01:30:11,406
让他的“叫第三排的小老太太抽张牌我猜”
把戏变得更简单
to simplify his problem of guessing the card
picked by the little old lady in the third row.

1143
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:15,076
陆军情报工作者也会使用它...
Also employed by
Army Intelligence officers who...

1144
01:30:15,076 --> 01:30:18,204
Rosie，咱们结婚吧
Rosie, let's get married.

1145
01:30:19,247 --> 01:30:23,418
- 咱们今晚真是热情高涨不是吗？
- 是啊
- We certainly are in good spirits tonight，are we？ 
- Yes we are.

1146
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:24,952
明天是个大日子
Tomorrow's the big day.

1147
01:30:24,952 --> 01:30:26,320
和Raymond一起吃午饭...
Lunch with Raymond...

1148
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,156
然后一起玩玩单人纸牌游戏...
then a nice little game
of solitaire...

1149
01:30:28,156 --> 01:30:31,319
然后好好地聊聊那些在朝鲜度过的美好的往昔
and a nice long chat
about the good old days in Korea...

1150
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:36,097
还有我们的一些中国和苏联的朋友
and some old Chinese
and Russian friends of ours.

1151
01:30:36,097 --> 01:30:39,362
然后给他点暗示，除掉身体里的一切操纵链接...
Then a suggestion ortwo
to rip out all of the wiring...

1152
01:30:41,202 --> 01:30:44,071
然后，亲爱的，一切就都结束了
and then, dear girl, it's over.
All over.

1153
01:30:44,071 --> 01:30:46,541
- 怎么回事儿，你不想吗？
- 不想干嘛？
- What's the matter, don't you want to?
- Want to what?

1154
01:30:46,541 --> 01:30:50,178
结婚啊，我跟你说话时你怎么不留心听？
Get married. Why don't you pay
attention to me when I speak to you?

1155
01:30:50,178 --> 01:30:55,116
Bennie，我想和你结婚的念头远超过
继续吃意大利菜的想法...
Bennie, I want to marry you more than
I want to go on eating Italian food...

1156
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:57,584
这会让你有个清楚的概念
which will give you some idea.

1157
01:30:59,620 --> 01:31:01,456
那咱们开始干吧，宝贝儿？
Then why don't we get with it, kiddo?

1158
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:05,426
像是，准备文件，准备血检，发请柬...
You know, arranging for the papers,
for the blood test, posting the banns...

1159
01:31:05,426 --> 01:31:07,562
想想给孩子取什么名，准备酒席...
figure out what we're gonna name the kids,
renting the rice...

1160
01:31:07,562 --> 01:31:10,861
- 买戒指，通知父母
- 父母？
- buy the ring, call the folks.
- Folks?

1161
01:31:11,899 --> 01:31:14,669
你也没有？孤儿？
You neither? Orphan?

1162
01:31:14,669 --> 01:31:19,240
我以前一直认为自己是
从火星飞来的太空船上的唯一幸存者
I used to be convinced that I was the sole
survivor of a spaceship that overshot Mars.

1163
01:31:19,240 --> 01:31:22,971
这个故事非常性感，非常非常性感
Very sexy stuff. Very, very sexy.

1164
01:31:36,324 --> 01:31:38,459
- Ben！
- 你好，Raymond
- Ben!
- Hello, Raymond.

1165
01:31:38,459 --> 01:31:42,964
Ben,我想让你见见Jocie
记得吗？我跟你讲过我和她的故事？
Ben, I want you to meet Jocie.
Remember, I told you about her?

1166
01:31:42,964 --> 01:31:45,099
这是我的朋友，Ben Marco少校
This is my friend, Maj. Ben Marco.

1167
01:31:45,099 --> 01:31:46,901
- Jordan小姐
- 你好，少校
- Miss Jordan.
- How do you do, Major?

1168
01:31:46,901 --> 01:31:51,105
只是，我已经不再是Jordan小姐了，
是Shaw太太，Raymond Shaw的妻子
Only, it's not Miss Jordan anymore.
It's Mrs. Shaw. Mrs. Raymond Shaw.

1169
01:31:51,105 --> 01:31:55,676
我们昨晚飞去了马里兰州，在那儿结了婚
刚回来
We flew to Maryland last night.
We got married. We Just got back.

1170
01:31:55,676 --> 01:31:58,312
你不打算开瓶香槟或是上街上跳舞...
Aren't you going to pop champagne,
or dance in the streets...

1171
01:31:58,312 --> 01:32:00,781
- 或者至少亲一下新娘》
- 恭喜你们
- or at least kiss the bride?
- Congratulations.

1172
01:32:00,781 --> 01:32:04,318
Ben，她好美
Ben, isn't she beautiful?

1173
01:32:04,318 --> 01:32:07,522
我是全世界最幸运的男人
Am I not the luckiest guy
in the whole world?

1174
01:32:07,522 --> 01:32:10,925
你不用回答，不管怎么说，我都是个幸运儿
You don't have to answer that.
Anyway, I'm the one who's lucky.

1175
01:32:10,925 --> 01:32:14,896
听着，亲爱的，这儿一定有啤酒或者香槟...
Listen, darling, there must be
some beer or champagne...

1176
01:32:14,896 --> 01:32:17,965
或者青霉素滴眼液，冰箱里或许还有点凤尾鱼
or penicillin eye-drops
or some anchovies in the ice box.

1177
01:32:17,965 --> 01:32:21,135
去看看都有什么吧，咱们三个得好好喝一杯
Crack open whatever it is.
The three of us have got to have a drink.

1178
01:32:21,135 --> 01:32:23,738
来吧，干起来，像个家庭主妇那样
Come on, bustle.
Make like a housewife.

1179
01:32:23,738 --> 01:32:25,373
我先脱下这套傻乎乎的衣服
I'll get out of this idiot suit.

1180
01:32:25,373 --> 01:32:28,142
Ben，你真应该看看法官的表情
Ben, you should've seen the judge's face.

1181
01:32:28,142 --> 01:32:31,879
我们俩在那儿，一个是方块皇后，我打扮的像谁...
我不知道...
There we were, the Queen of Diamonds
and me looking like, I don't know...

1182
01:32:31,879 --> 01:32:33,710
像Groucho Marx
like Groucho Marx.

1183
01:32:34,949 --> 01:32:37,385
Groucho Marx？
Groucho Marx?

1184
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:40,721
Ben，我刚刚开了个玩笑
Ben, I just made a joke.

1185
01:32:40,721 --> 01:32:43,424
不是个好玩笑，我承认，但是个玩笑
Not a very good joke,
I admit, but a joke.

1186
01:32:43,424 --> 01:32:46,093
你之前听过我开玩笑嘛？
Have you ever before
heard me make a joke?

1187
01:32:46,093 --> 01:32:50,331
我刚刚开了一个玩笑，Groucho Marx，我
I just made one.
Groucho Marx，me.

1188
01:32:50,331 --> 01:32:52,433
今天是个好日子！你得把今天记下来
Big day! Mark that down in your book.

1189
01:32:52,433 --> 01:32:55,459
Raymond Shaw不但结婚了，还开了个玩笑
Raymond Shaw got married,
and he made a joke.

1190
01:32:56,604 --> 01:32:58,231
Groucho Marx
Groucho Marx.

1191
01:33:03,878 --> 01:33:07,481
“方块皇后”？这是什么意思？
'The Queen of Diamonds? '
What did he mean，The Queen of Diamonds?

1192
01:33:07,481 --> 01:33:11,085
是我的装扮，我扮成方块皇后去的派对
My costume. I came to this costume party
as the Queen of Diamonds.

1193
01:33:11,085 --> 01:33:14,221
我不知道穿什么好，然后我在商店看到了
一套大扑克牌服装
I didn't know what to wear.
Then I saw this big playing card in a shop.

1194
01:33:14,221 --> 01:33:15,756
Shaw太太
少校，请叫我Jocie
Mrs. Shaw.
Please, Major, Jocie.

1195
01:33:15,756 --> 01:33:17,825
少校，请叫我Jocie
Please, Major, Jocie.

1196
01:33:17,825 --> 01:33:19,627
你叫我Jocie，我叫你Ben
You call me Jocie,
I'll call you Ben.

1197
01:33:19,627 --> 01:33:22,221
Shaw太太，Jocie...
Mrs. Shaw, Jocie...

1198
01:33:23,264 --> 01:33:24,465
我今天早上来是要...
the reason I came here
this morning...

1199
01:33:24,465 --> 01:33:27,802
问问Raymond愿不愿意自愿被捕
is to ask Raymond to voluntarily
put himself under arrest.

1200
01:33:27,802 --> 01:33:29,070
什么？
What?

1201
01:33:29,070 --> 01:33:32,273
不像是逮捕，这个词重了，但是...
Maybe not under arrest,
that's pretty strong, but...

1202
01:33:32,273 --> 01:33:34,575
是让他自愿接受审问
to surrender himself
for some questioning.

1203
01:33:34,575 --> 01:33:37,169
审问？什么样的审问？
Questioning?
What kind of questioning?

1204
01:33:38,379 --> 01:33:43,150
Raymond病了，Shaw太太，一种特别的病
Raymond is sick, Mrs. Shaw,
in a kind of a special way.

1205
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:46,287
- 他自己还没有意识到
- 病了？他可没病
- He doesn't even realize it himself.
- Sick? He's not sick.

1206
01:33:46,287 --> 01:33:48,589
他是我见过的最健康的人
He's the healthiest man I've seen
in my whole life.

1207
01:33:48,589 --> 01:33:53,322
- 你看看他就知道了
- 我不是说身体上的病
- You can tell that by just looking at him.
- That's not the kind of sick I mean.

1208
01:33:55,496 --> 01:33:57,465
你错了，Ben, 你错了
You're wrong, Ben. You're wrong.

1209
01:33:57,465 --> 01:34:02,903
他的内心很混乱，就像有几千个结一样
我知道
He's tied up inside, in a thousand knots,
I know that.

1210
01:34:02,903 --> 01:34:05,633
但你应该看看他和我在一起时的样子
But you can see for yourself
how he is with me.

1211
01:34:20,788 --> 01:34:23,424
我们六个小时前刚结婚
We were married just six hours ago.

1212
01:34:23,424 --> 01:34:27,520
我们在车里，在办公室里，在飞机上
每一分每一秒都在一起
We've been in cars and offices
and airplanes ever since.

1213
01:34:29,263 --> 01:34:32,824
你们有什么计划？
What are your plans?

1214
01:34:34,001 --> 01:34:37,204
有家小旅馆，叫贝福德之家，
在离贝福德村很近的地方
There's an inn, The Bedford House,
near Bedford village...

1215
01:34:37,204 --> 01:34:39,206
离这儿大约一小时的路程
it's about an hour from here.

1216
01:34:39,206 --> 01:34:41,776
现在是淡季，几乎没什么人
There's hardly anyone there
this early in the season.

1217
01:34:41,776 --> 01:34:43,710
我们已经订好了房间
We've already wired for a room.

1218
01:34:45,212 --> 01:34:49,546
Ben，你得相信我，我会让他恢复健康的
Ben, you've got to believe me and trust me,
I can make him well.

1219
01:34:51,485 --> 01:34:56,190
我给你48小时，后天带他回来
I'll give you 48 hours. Have him
back here day after tomorrow.

1220
01:34:56,190 --> 01:34:57,782
我到时再和他谈
I'll talk to him then.

1221
01:34:59,226 --> 01:35:00,887
之后的事，再看吧
After that, we'll see.

1222
01:35:02,163 --> 01:35:04,331
谢谢你，Ben
Thank you, Ben.

1223
01:35:04,331 --> 01:35:05,992
谢谢你，上帝会保佑你的
Thank you, and God bless you.

1224
01:35:15,109 --> 01:35:16,303
亲爱的
Darling.

1225
01:35:25,953 --> 01:35:26,920
什么事？
What?

1226
01:35:27,955 --> 01:35:29,824
没事
Nothing.

1227
01:35:29,824 --> 01:35:31,724
只想叫你一声亲爱的
Just darling.

1228
01:35:48,309 --> 01:35:49,537
我亲爱的姑娘...
My dear girl...

1229
01:35:50,578 --> 01:35:55,883
你注意到人类被分为两种截然不同又无法调和的群体了吗？
have you noticed the human race is divided
into two distinct and irreconcilable groups?

1230
01:35:55,883 --> 01:35:59,920
一群人走进房间，不自觉地把电视打开...
Those who walk into rooms
and automatically turn television sets on...

1231
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:03,891
另一群人走进来，又不自觉地把电视关上
and those who walk into rooms
and automatically turn them off.

1232
01:36:03,891 --> 01:36:08,295
问题是，两群人还经常通婚，这自然就导致了...
The problem is they usually
marry each other, which naturally causes a great deal...

1233
01:36:08,295 --> 01:36:10,397
Jocelyn Jordan，Thomas Jordan参议员的女儿...
<i>... elopement of Jocelyn Jordan,</i>
<i>daughter of Sen. Thomas Jordan...</i>

1234
01:36:10,397 --> 01:36:14,769
和朝鲜战争英雄，Raymond Shaw，
John Iselin的继子，两人已经私奔...
<i>and Korean war hero, Raymond Shaw,</i>
<i>stepson of Sen. John Iselin.</i>

1235
01:36:14,769 --> 01:36:17,738
看起来...
- 我的罗密欧
<i>- It appears that this...</i>
- My Romeo.

1236
01:36:17,738 --> 01:36:20,474
这种罗密欧与朱丽叶式的结合，
没有对两党领导人...
<i>... the Montague-Capulet note</i>
<i>would have little effect on the feud</i>

1237
01:36:20,474 --> 01:36:22,243
之间的不和产生多大影响
now raging between
the two party leaders.

1238
01:36:22,243 --> 01:36:26,280
今早，Iselin参议员在他的竞选大本营...
<i>From his campaign headquarters,this morning</i>
<i>Senator Iselin stepped up his charges</i>

1239
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:29,350
向这位反对他获得提名的政党领导人提出了控诉
against the leader of the group,
attempting to block his nomination.

1240
01:36:29,350 --> 01:36:33,320
我现在控告这个男人，Thomas Jordan，
<i>I now charge this man, Thomas Jordan, </i>

1241
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:34,722
犯了严重的叛国罪
with high treason

1242
01:36:34,722 --> 01:36:39,126
并且我保证，当参议院再开会的时候...
<i>And I assure you,</i>
<i>the moment the Senate reconvenes...</i>

1243
01:36:39,126 --> 01:36:42,830
我会弹劾Jordan！
<i>I shall move for</i>
<i>this man Jordan's impeachment!</i>

1244
01:36:42,830 --> 01:36:46,300
之后，再对他进行全民审判
<i>and after that，a civil trial.</i>

1245
01:36:46,300 --> 01:36:49,603
快去穿好衣服，回纽约去
Come on, get dressed.
We're driving down to New York.

1246
01:36:49,603 --> 01:36:51,372
直接去你爸家
Go straight to your father's house.

1247
01:36:51,372 --> 01:36:53,874
替我向他道个歉，我之后再和你会合
Convey my personal apologies to him.
I'll join you later.

1248
01:36:53,874 --> 01:36:55,501
你要干嘛？
What are you going to do?

1249
01:36:57,945 --> 01:37:00,848
做点我早就应该做的事
Something I should have done
a long time ago.

1250
01:37:00,848 --> 01:37:05,717
我要去打死那个卑鄙无耻乱造谣的混蛋！
I'm going to beat that vile, slandering,
son-of-a-numbskull to a bloody pulp!

1251
01:37:09,223 --> 01:37:11,192
妈！
Mother!

1252
01:37:11,192 --> 01:37:14,855
你那个卑鄙乱造谣的丈夫在哪儿？
That vile, slandering husband of yours,
where is he?

1253
01:37:15,930 --> 01:37:19,798
亲爱的，出了很重要的事，你必须得做点什么
Darling，something very important has come up.
There is something you have to do.

1254
01:37:39,286 --> 01:37:40,617
谁啊？
Who is it?

1255
01:37:42,990 --> 01:37:44,225
是我，先生
It's me, sir.

1256
01:37:44,225 --> 01:37:46,216
Raymond，我的孩子
Raymond, my boy.

1257
01:37:47,661 --> 01:37:52,032
Jocie等了你好久，她一小时前就睡了
Jocie waited up as long as she could.
She turned in about one hour.

1258
01:37:52,032 --> 01:37:54,125
她把好消息告诉我了
She told me the good news.

1259
01:37:55,336 --> 01:37:59,006
我恭喜你们并且欢迎你加入我们家
I want to offer my congratulations
and welcome you to the family.

1260
01:37:59,006 --> 01:38:01,675
我整整一晚都在看我女儿的脸
I've been watching my daughter's face
all evening.

1261
01:38:01,675 --> 01:38:04,745
- 她很快乐
- 谢谢你，先生
- She's a very happy girl.
- Thank you, sir.

1262
01:38:04,745 --> 01:38:07,715
跟我来，我给你倒点好酒...
Come with me.
I'll force some good whiskey on you...

1263
01:38:07,715 --> 01:38:12,219
你们结婚了，得庆祝一下，
忙了一天你也得喝一杯平静平静
to celebrate your wedding,
soothe you after a trying day，any number of reasons.

1264
01:38:12,219 --> 01:38:15,956
你身旁的橱柜里有威士忌，自己倒吧
There's some whiskey in that cabinet
beside you. Help yourself.

1265
01:38:15,956 --> 01:38:20,995
我只希望Iselin那些愚蠢的抨击不会让你太烦心
I only hope you haven't been too much
upset by these idiotic attacks of Iselin's.

1266
01:38:20,995 --> 01:38:25,232
实际上我早就把他的抨击都当成荣耀了
Actually, I take the position
that any attack by Iselin is a great honor.

1267
01:38:25,232 --> 01:38:29,669
并且在过去的22年里我从未有过这么多的支持者
Actually, I haven't had so much supporting
mail in the Senate in the last 22 years.

1268
01:38:30,771 --> 01:38:33,467
我很高兴听到这个，先生
I'm very glad to hear that, sir.

1269
01:38:34,975 --> 01:38:37,211
你手里拿着什么？
What the hell is that in your hand?

1270
01:38:37,211 --> 01:38:39,546
是把手枪，先生
It's a pistol, sir.

1271
01:38:39,546 --> 01:38:41,446
还是把消音的？
Is that a silencer?

1272
01:38:43,417 --> 01:38:45,715
你带把手枪干嘛？
Why are you carrying a pistol?

1273
01:38:47,388 --> 01:38:48,855
Raymond...
Raymond...

1274
01:38:58,198 --> 01:38:59,688
爸，是谁来了？
Daddy, what is it?

1275
01:40:10,838 --> 01:40:14,508
Ben，出什么事了？
Ben, what is it?

1276
01:40:14,508 --> 01:40:17,944
Raymond Shaw今早射杀了他的妻子
Raymond Shaw shot and killed his wife
early this morning.

1277
01:40:23,984 --> 01:40:27,681
- 上面没说是他干的...
- 我知道
- But it doesn't say...
- I know.

1278
01:40:29,289 --> 01:40:31,723
并不真的是Raymond干的
It wasn't Raymond that really did it.

1279
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:35,585
从某种程度上说，是我干的
In a way, it was me.

1280
01:40:37,498 --> 01:40:40,534
你们都知道，先生们...
As you can well understand,
gentlemen...

1281
01:40:40,534 --> 01:40:44,938
我妻子对失去这样一位可爱完美的女孩感到十分痛心...
my wife is prostrate over the loss
of this dear and wonderful girl...

1282
01:40:44,938 --> 01:40:46,940
她就像爱自己的女儿一样爱她
whom she loved as a daughter.

1283
01:40:46,940 --> 01:40:49,943
参议员先生，你的继子现在在哪儿？
And your stepson, Senator,
where is he?

1284
01:40:49,943 --> 01:40:53,213
我的儿子Raymond把自己藏了起来...
My son Raymond's in retreat...

1285
01:40:53,213 --> 01:40:57,351
向上帝祈求力量与理解...
praying for strength
and understanding...

1286
01:40:57,351 --> 01:40:59,842
尝试让自己从悲伤中走出来，继续生活
to try and carry on somehow.

1287
01:41:04,925 --> 01:41:06,984
Ben，找你的
Ben, it's for you.

1288
01:41:13,967 --> 01:41:15,491
我是Marco少校
Maj. Marco speaking.

1289
01:41:21,308 --> 01:41:22,741
为什么会有人...Jocie
How could anyone... Jocie.

1290
01:41:25,612 --> 01:41:27,581
怎么会出这种事？
<i>How could it happen?</i>

1291
01:41:27,581 --> 01:41:29,242
你在哪儿，Raymond？
Where are you, Raymond?

1292
01:41:31,418 --> 01:41:33,978
我觉得我要疯了
I think maybe I'm going crazy.

1293
01:41:35,255 --> 01:41:39,026
我开始做恶梦了...那些噩梦就像，
你以前做过的那些一样...
I'm having... terrible dreams
like you used to have and...

1294
01:41:39,026 --> 01:41:43,725
你在哪儿？咱们最好当面谈
告诉我你在哪儿
Where are you? We can't talk on
the telephone. Just tell me where you are.

1295
01:41:45,933 --> 01:41:48,163
我在一家宾馆的房间里
I'm in a hotel room...

1296
01:41:50,137 --> 01:41:51,832
在花园对面
across from the Garden.

1297
01:41:52,940 --> 01:41:54,965
在第八大街
Eighth Avenue side

1298
01:41:56,143 --> 01:41:58,545
4号房
Room 4.

1299
01:41:58,545 --> 01:42:01,648
好的，听好，在那里等我，我十分钟内肯定到
All right. Listen to me. Wait there.
I'll be there in 10 minutes.

1300
01:42:01,648 --> 01:42:04,048
别乱走动，就在那儿等我
Don't move, just wait right there.

1301
01:42:05,552 --> 01:42:07,454
好的，我现在去见见他
Okay, I'll take him now.

1302
01:42:07,454 --> 01:42:09,656
注意，万事都要小心处置
Everything's got to move quite normally.

1303
01:42:09,656 --> 01:42:13,490
我会让他觉得自己很安全，给我一副牌
I want him to feel like he's safe.
Just give me a pack of cards.

1304
01:42:15,062 --> 01:42:20,193
他们刚刚把副总统提名给了那个白痴Iselin
They just handed the vice-presidential
nomination to that idiot Iselin.

1305
01:42:37,918 --> 01:42:39,249
你好，孩子
Hi, kid.

1306
01:42:42,322 --> 01:42:46,383
谁杀了她，Ben？
Who killed Jocie, Ben?

1307
01:42:47,561 --> 01:42:50,189
告诉我，我想知道
Tell me, I've got to know.

1308
01:43:06,647 --> 01:43:09,878
玩会儿单人纸牌放松一下吧
How about passing the time
by playing a little solitaire?

1309
01:43:20,127 --> 01:43:24,765
好的，现在让我们来解开一些谜团吧
All，right.Now let's start unlocking a few doors.

1310
01:43:24,765 --> 01:43:27,201
从侦察队开始
Let's begin with the patrol.

1311
01:43:27,201 --> 01:43:31,338
你没有救我们的命也没有消灭一个连的敌人...
You didn't save our lives or take out
an enemy company or anything like that...

1312
01:43:31,338 --> 01:43:34,875
对吧，Raymond？
did you, Raymond?

1313
01:43:34,875 --> 01:43:36,069
究竟发生了什么事？
What happened?

1314
01:43:37,744 --> 01:43:40,975
侦察队被一队苏联空降兵抓住...
The patrol was taken
by a Russian airborne unit...

1315
01:43:42,015 --> 01:43:44,918
带上直升飞机...
and flown by helicopter...

1316
01:43:44,918 --> 01:43:48,479
穿过满洲里边界，送到了一个叫东华的地方
across the Manchurian border
to a place called Tunghwa.

1317
01:43:50,157 --> 01:43:52,250
我们被一队来自莫斯科帕夫洛夫学院...
We were worked on for three days...

1318
01:43:53,293 --> 01:43:57,525
的专家训练了三天
by a team of specialists
from the Pavlov Institute in Moscow.

1319
01:43:58,832 --> 01:44:03,537
他们研发了一种技术，能够入侵人的潜意识...
They've developed a technique
for descent into the unconscious mind...

1320
01:44:03,537 --> 01:44:08,242
- 通过光诱导和药物来实现
- 现在先不管这些
- part light-induced and part drug.
- Never mind all that，not now.

1321
01:44:08,242 --> 01:44:11,411
告诉我在东华还发生了什么
Tell me what else happened at Tunghwa.

1322
01:44:11,411 --> 01:44:13,709
我们被训练了三天
We were drilled for three days.

1323
01:44:15,015 --> 01:44:18,652
我们被要求记住假想行动的所有细节
We were made to memorize
the details of the imaginary action.

1324
01:44:18,652 --> 01:44:20,017
还有呢？
What else?

1325
01:44:25,826 --> 01:44:29,129
我勒死了Ed Mavole...
And I strangled Ed Mavole...

1326
01:44:29,129 --> 01:44:31,495
射杀了Bobby Lembeck
and shot Bobby Lembeck.

1327
01:44:34,167 --> 01:44:36,870
一张方块皇后就能有这么好的效果
One red queen works pretty good.

1328
01:44:36,870 --> 01:44:41,102
我们看看两张会怎么样，继续玩吧
Let's see what we get with two of them.
Keep playing.

1329
01:44:55,255 --> 01:44:58,019
然后我杀了Gaines先生
Then I killed Mr. Gaines.

1330
01:45:00,193 --> 01:45:02,696
那只是个测试，我杀谁都无所谓
It was just a test.
It didn't matter who I killed.

1331
01:45:02,696 --> 01:45:05,666
他们选了他，来检测我是否服从命令...
They picked him to see
if the linkages worked...

1332
01:45:05,666 --> 01:45:08,068
在我被交给美国操控者之前
before they turned me over
to my American operator.

1333
01:45:08,068 --> 01:45:11,401
并且跳湖那件事...
And that business
about jumping in the lake...

1334
01:45:14,241 --> 01:45:20,213
那确实是我进入催眠模式后干的
it really did happen.

1335
01:45:20,213 --> 01:45:21,840
那是个意外
It was an accident.

1336
01:45:22,883 --> 01:45:26,586
我在酒吧看到了触发物，碰巧又有人说了类似命令的话
Something somebody said in the bar
accidentally triggered it.

1337
01:45:26,586 --> 01:45:28,144

继续玩Keep playing.

1338
01:45:38,999 --> 01:45:42,696
然后我杀了Jordan参议员
Then I killed Sen. Jordan.

1339
01:45:44,638 --> 01:45:46,606
然后...
And after that...

1340
01:45:48,375 --> 01:45:53,747
你听令，忘掉在参议员家发生的所有事
You are to forget everything that
happened at the Senator's house.

1341
01:45:53,747 --> 01:45:58,446
明白吗？只有我允许你记起来时，
你才可以记起来
Do you understand? You'll only
remember it when I tell you so.

1342
01:46:01,755 --> 01:46:05,521
现在，Raymond，一个重要的问题
Now, Raymond, now the big one.

1343
01:46:06,827 --> 01:46:10,797
这一切都是为了什么？
Why is all of this being done?

1344
01:46:10,797 --> 01:46:13,265
他们训练你是为了干什么？
What have they built you to do?

1345
01:46:14,668 --> 01:46:16,329
我不知道
I don't know.

1346
01:46:20,073 --> 01:46:23,610
我不觉得有人知道...除了
I don't think anybody really
knows except...

1347
01:46:23,610 --> 01:46:25,771
莫斯科的Berezovo
Berezovo in Moscow...

1348
01:46:26,947 --> 01:46:29,507
还有我的在美国的操控者
and my American operator here.

1349
01:46:31,051 --> 01:46:34,688
不管是什么，应该很快会在...
Whatever it is,
it's supposed to happen soon...

1350
01:46:34,688 --> 01:46:37,391
大选时发生
right at the convention.

1351
01:46:37,391 --> 01:46:38,585
或许...
Maybe...

1352
01:46:40,427 --> 01:46:42,054
我不知道
I don't know.

1353
01:46:45,665 --> 01:46:48,532
他们可以命令我做任何事，Ben...
They can make me do anything, Ben...

1354
01:46:49,569 --> 01:46:51,093
不是吗？
can't they?

1355
01:46:52,539 --> 01:46:54,441
任何事
Anything.

1356
01:46:54,441 --> 01:46:56,710
走着瞧，孩子
We'll see, kid.

1357
01:46:56,710 --> 01:47:00,271
无论他们做什么，都会被我们阻止
We'll see what they can do,
and we'll see what we can do.

1358
01:47:03,650 --> 01:47:05,982
所以方块皇后是关键
So the red queen is our baby.

1359
01:47:07,788 --> 01:47:09,915
看着他们，孩子
Take a look at this, kid.

1360
01:47:12,526 --> 01:47:14,995
52张方块皇后
Fifty-two of them.

1361
01:47:14,995 --> 01:47:18,055
好好看着他们，Raymond
Take a good look at them, Raymond.

1362
01:47:19,099 --> 01:47:20,133
你看着他们，听我说
And while you're looking, listen.

1363
01:47:20,133 --> 01:47:22,533
这是Marco在对你讲话
This is me, Marco, talking.

1364
01:47:23,804 --> 01:47:27,307
52张方块皇后和我在对你说话
你知道我们在对你说什么吗？
Fifty-two red queens and me are telling you.
You know what we're telling you?

1365
01:47:27,307 --> 01:47:28,742
结束了
It's over.

1366
01:47:28,742 --> 01:47:32,379
那些链接，他们那些漂亮的控制你的链接，已经被摧毁了
The links, their beautifully conditioned
links are smashed.

1367
01:47:32,379 --> 01:47:35,282
我们说它们被摧毁了，那他们就是被摧毁了
They're smashed as of now,
because we say so.

1368
01:47:35,282 --> 01:47:42,389
我们在摧毁链接，撕碎电线
We're busting up the joint,
we're tearing out all the wires.

1369
01:47:42,389 --> 01:47:44,491
皇后的所有骑兵和战士...
All the queen's horses
and queen's men...

1370
01:47:44,491 --> 01:47:46,660
都不能把那个旧的Raymond拼回来了
will never put old Raymond
back together again.

1371
01:47:46,660 --> 01:47:50,430
你再也不用工作了，这是命令
You don't work anymore.
That's an order.

1372
01:47:50,430 --> 01:47:53,233
再有任何人邀请你玩单人纸牌...
Anybody invites you to
a game of solitaire...

1373
01:47:53,233 --> 01:47:57,226
你就告诉他们，对不起老兄，游戏结束了
you tell them, 'Sorry, buster,
the ball game is over.'

1374
01:48:22,829 --> 01:48:26,765
我的美国操控者要给我任务了
It's time for my American operator
to give me the plan.

1375
01:48:32,072 --> 01:48:34,199
是的，是的，我明白了，母亲
Yes. Yes, I understand, Mother.

1376
01:48:43,183 --> 01:48:45,785
她让我立刻去找她
She wants me to go.

1377
01:48:45,785 --> 01:48:49,055
楼下有辆车在等我
There's a car waiting
for me downstairs.

1378
01:48:49,055 --> 01:48:53,287
晚上九点，大选进入就职演讲环节，
The convention reconvenes at 9:00 p.m.
For the acceptance speeches.

1379
01:48:54,327 --> 01:48:56,955
在那之前，我觉得不会有事发生
I don't think anything
will happen until then.

1380
01:48:58,765 --> 01:49:01,700
- 我得走了
- 给你个电话号码
- I'd better go now.
- Here is a number.

1381
01:49:08,808 --> 01:49:12,369
我手下有500人，如果需要，人数还可以增加到1000
I've got 500 people at my disposal,
a thousand if I need them.

1382
01:49:13,580 --> 01:49:17,250
打这个电话找我...
尽量在8:30之前打...
You call me at that number.
Try to call me by 8:30...

1383
01:49:17,250 --> 01:49:21,414
或者你尽快搞清楚他们要干什么，打给我
or as soon as you find out
whatever it is they want you to do.

1384
01:49:29,663 --> 01:49:33,633
记住，Raymond，电线已经拔掉了
Remember, Raymond,
the wires have been pulled.

1385
01:49:33,633 --> 01:49:36,436
他们没法儿再控制你了
They can't touch you anymore.

1386
01:49:36,436 --> 01:49:38,097
你自由了
You're free.

1387
01:49:50,717 --> 01:49:53,515
我决定让你穿牧师的衣服...
It's been decided that you will be
dressed as a priest...

1388
01:49:54,588 --> 01:49:58,124
以便你在之后的混乱中脱身
to help you get away
in the pandemonium afterwards.

1389
01:49:58,124 --> 01:50:01,027
春锦会给你一支两件式苏联狙击步枪...
Chunjin will give you a two-piece
Soviet Army sniper's rifle...

1390
01:50:01,027 --> 01:50:03,495
正好放进一个特制的手提箱里
that fits nicely into a special bag.

1391
01:50:04,664 --> 01:50:07,292
那儿有一个不用的打追光用的房间
There's a spotlight booth
that won't be in use.

1392
01:50:08,335 --> 01:50:11,133
就在花园第8大道那边的屋顶下
It's up under the roof on the Eighth Avenue
side of the Garden.

1393
01:50:12,372 --> 01:50:15,830
你开枪一定要又准又隐蔽
You will have absolutely clear,
protected shooting.

1394
01:50:21,414 --> 01:50:25,585
你要开枪打总统候选人的头...
You are to shoot the presidential
nominee through the head...

1395
01:50:25,585 --> 01:50:29,289
然后Johnny就会勇敢地站起来...
and Johnny will rise gallantly
to his feet...

1396
01:50:29,289 --> 01:50:32,892
扶着Ben Arthur的尸体...
and lift Ben Arthur's body
in his arms...

1397
01:50:32,892 --> 01:50:36,555
站在麦克风前开始演说
and stand in front of the microphones
and begin to speak.

1398
01:50:38,431 --> 01:50:40,767
演说很短...
The speech is short...

1399
01:50:40,767 --> 01:50:44,671
但那是我听过的最鼓舞人心的演说
but it's the most rousing speech
I've ever read.

1400
01:50:44,671 --> 01:50:48,368
这项工作已经在这里和苏联断断续续地进行了八年了
It's been worked on here and in Russia,
on and off, for over eight years.

1401
01:50:49,509 --> 01:50:52,979
我会让人从他手里把尸体带走
I shall force someone
to take the body away from him.

1402
01:50:52,979 --> 01:50:56,716
然后Johnny会吸引所有的麦克风和摄像机...
Then Johnny will really hit those
microphones and those cameras...

1403
01:50:56,716 --> 01:50:58,518
身上沾满Arthur的鲜血...
with blood all over him...

1404
01:50:58,518 --> 01:51:00,286
拉开所有试图帮他的人...
fighting off anyone who tries
to help him...

1405
01:51:00,286 --> 01:51:03,990
保卫美国，
即使这意味着Johnny牺牲他自己的生命
Defending America,
even if it means his own death.

1406
01:51:03,990 --> 01:51:07,527
这会让全国的电视观众陷入疯狂...
Rallying a nation of television viewers
into hysteria...

1407
01:51:07,527 --> 01:51:09,396
把我们送进白宫...
to sweep us up into the White House...

1408
01:51:09,396 --> 01:51:13,594
我们会手握大权，把军事管制变成彻头彻尾的混乱
with powers that will make martial law
seem like anarchy.

1409
01:51:14,634 --> 01:51:17,194
Now this is very important...

1410
01:51:18,571 --> 01:51:20,774
好好听着接下来的话...
I want the nominee to be dead...

1411
01:51:20,774 --> 01:51:24,711
我想要候选人在开始演讲两分钟后死去...
I want the nominee to be dead about two minutes after
he begins his acceptance speech...

1412
01:51:24,711 --> 01:51:27,514
由于他讲话的速度有变化
depending on his reading time
under pressure.

1413
01:51:27,514 --> 01:51:32,719
他一说完以下句子，你就开枪，
You are to hit him right at the point
that he finishes the phrase

1414
01:51:32,719 --> 01:51:35,855
我不会要求任何一个美国同胞
'Nor would I ask of any fellow
American... '

1415
01:51:35,855 --> 01:51:37,957
起来保卫自己的自由
'in defense of his freedom... '

1416
01:51:37,957 --> 01:51:42,595
但我会起来保卫每个人的自由
'that which I would not
gladly give myself.'

1417
01:51:42,595 --> 01:51:46,031
我把我的生命献给自由的美国
'My life before my liberty.'

1418
01:51:47,367 --> 01:51:49,927
听清楚了吗？
Is that absolutely clear?

1419
01:51:54,808 --> 01:51:57,744
能给我重复一遍吗？Raymond？
Would you repeat it for me, Raymond?

1420
01:51:57,744 --> 01:52:00,914
我不会要求任何一个美国同胞
'Nor would I ask of any fellow American... '

1421
01:52:00,914 --> 01:52:04,017
起来保卫自己的自由
'in defense of his freedom... '

1422
01:52:04,017 --> 01:52:06,586
但我会起来保卫每个人的...
'that which I would not
gladly give... '

1423
01:52:06,586 --> 01:52:08,922
自由
'myself.'

1424
01:52:08,922 --> 01:52:13,916
我把我的生命献给自由的美国
'My life before my liberty.'

1425
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:31,010
我知道你永远也不会理解这一切，Raymond...
I know you will never entirely
comprehend this, Raymond...

1426
01:52:31,010 --> 01:52:35,504
但你得相信我，我不知道会是你被催眠
but you must believe
I did not know it would be you.

1427
01:52:36,549 --> 01:52:39,986
我为他们工作，为他们而战
I served them.
I fought for them.

1428
01:52:39,986 --> 01:52:41,421
我正在为他们赢取...
I'm on the point of
inning for them...

1429
01:52:41,421 --> 01:52:44,824
打败美国的最好机会
the greatest foothold
they will ever have in this country.

1430
01:52:44,824 --> 01:52:50,430
他们却如此回报我，把你的灵魂带走，
给我一具空壳
And they paid me back
by taking your soul away from you.

1431
01:52:50,430 --> 01:52:53,266
我跟他们说过，帮我训练一个刺客
I told them to build me
an assassin.

1432
01:52:53,266 --> 01:52:58,438
我想要一个来自杀手世界的杀手，然后他们选择了你...
I wanted a killer from a world
filled with killers, and they chose you...

1433
01:52:58,438 --> 01:53:02,272
因为他们觉得这样，会让我和他们的关系更紧密
because they thought it would bind me
closer to them.

1434
01:53:05,712 --> 01:53:09,516
现在，一切都要结束了
But now we have come
almost to the end.

1435
01:53:09,516 --> 01:53:12,085
只剩最后一步...
One last step...

1436
01:53:12,085 --> 01:53:17,056
当我得到权力，我就会让他们...
and when I take power they will be
pulled down and ground into dirt...

1437
01:53:17,056 --> 01:53:19,524
为在你身上做的一切...
for what they did to you...

1438
01:53:20,760 --> 01:53:25,288
为轻蔑地低估我，付出代价
and what they did in so contemptuously
underestimating me.

1439
01:54:10,009 --> 01:54:14,912
测试，1,2,3,4,5,6
Test.One, two, three, four, five, six.

1440
01:55:17,844 --> 01:55:20,108
我们需要灯光，开灯
We need the lights. Lights.

1441
01:55:38,331 --> 01:55:41,459
关灯
Lights out.

1442
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:09,662
他为什么还没打来？
Why hasn't he called?

1443
01:56:09,662 --> 01:56:12,324
这是预料之中的风险，Ben，
你当时做的对
It was a calculated risk, Ben.
You were right to take it.

1444
01:56:13,366 --> 01:56:15,926
虽然这不是真的，但我很高兴你能这么说
Even if it's not true,
it's nice of you to say it.

1445
01:56:19,105 --> 01:56:21,733
- 花园里全是人
- 别紧张
- The Garden's filling up.
- Take it easy.

1446
01:56:22,842 --> 01:56:25,834
- 8:44了
- 我知道
- 8:44.
- I know.

1447
01:56:31,417 --> 01:56:34,654
如果Steinkamp还不把那顶傻乎乎的帽子摘了...
If Steinkamp doesn't take off
that stupid hat...

1448
01:56:34,654 --> 01:56:37,123
赶紧去干活儿，我就把他降到一等兵
and stop messing around with
those broads, I'll bust him into a PFC.

1449
01:56:37,123 --> 01:56:38,647
放松，Ben
Easy, Ben.

1450
01:56:42,795 --> 01:56:45,787
好吧，Milt，我搞砸了！是我搞砸了！
Okay, Milt, I blew it! I blew it！

1451
01:56:47,300 --> 01:56:49,902
我想那个的戏法比你的强，应该用我的，
My magic is better than your magic.

1452
01:56:49,902 --> 01:56:53,106
我早就该知道的，情报工作者，
I should've known better.
Intelligence Officer.

1453
01:56:53,106 --> 01:56:55,165
应该叫我傻瓜情报工作者
Stupidity Officer is better.

1454
01:56:56,709 --> 01:56:58,878
如果五角大楼想开设一个傻瓜部门...
If the Pentagon wants to open up
a stupidity division...

1455
01:56:58,878 --> 01:57:00,869
我应该去当头儿
they know who they can get
to lead it.

1456
01:57:04,851 --> 01:57:10,356
Raymond是他们的，他是他们的，并且永远
都是他们的
Raymond was theirs, he is theirs,
and he'll always be theirs.

1457
01:57:10,356 --> 01:57:13,621
还有时间，他还有可能打来
There's time.
He may still call.

1458
01:57:18,231 --> 01:57:19,664
为了钱吗？
For money?

1459
01:57:25,938 --> 01:57:27,769
我是这么想的
That's what I figured.

1460
01:57:32,578 --> 01:57:35,547
- 咱们走吧
- 好的，Ben，咱们走
- Let's get the hell out of here.
- All right, Ben, let's go.

1461
01:59:08,908 --> 01:59:10,710
Milt,你得阻止这个集会！
Milt,you've got to stop this thing.

1462
01:59:10,710 --> 01:59:13,112
我怎么阻止？用什么理由？
How can I stop it?
On what evidence?

1463
01:59:13,112 --> 01:59:16,549
如果这儿有个炸弹，或者你收到线报说这儿有炸弹，
你一定会阻止这个集会的，
If there was a bomb here,
or you got a tip there was, you'd stop it.

1464
01:59:16,549 --> 01:59:18,184
即使是要清空白宫里的人，你也一定会这么干的
You'd empty the White House,
if you had to.

1465
01:59:18,184 --> 01:59:21,620
我跟你说，这儿有个定时炸弹，正在倒计时
I tell yuo there's a time bomb here,
just waiting to go off.

1466
01:59:25,024 --> 01:59:28,824
女士们先生们，现在奏国歌
Ladies and gentlemen,
our national anthem

1467
01:59:49,582 --> 01:59:53,109
别抽了，Raymond从来没失过手
Stop twitching，Raymond has never missed
with a rifle in his life.

1468
02:00:47,974 --> 02:00:50,204
我们就要成功了，亲爱的
We're in like Flynn, lover.

1469
02:01:10,696 --> 02:01:13,633
- 女士们先生们
- 放松就好
<i>- Ladies and gentlemen...</i>
- Just take it easy.

1470
02:01:13,633 --> 02:01:18,696
让我们欢迎，下一任美国总统！
I give you the next President
of the United States！

1471
02:01:49,435 --> 02:01:51,460
主席先生...
<i>Mr. Chairman...</i>

1472
02:01:52,672 --> 02:01:57,243
代表们，我的美国同胞们...
<i>delegates, my fellow Americans...</i>

1473
02:01:57,243 --> 02:01:59,779
这是一份需要极大的谦卑...
<i>It is with great humility...</i>

1474
02:01:59,779 --> 02:02:03,182
带着高度自豪的工作...
<i>albeit with enormous pride...</i>

1475
02:02:03,182 --> 02:02:07,019
我觉得，必须要有人来干这份工作...
<i>and with a sense of the job to be done...</i>

1476
02:02:07,019 --> 02:02:11,023
那么我就带着谦卑与感激之心...
<i>that I most humbly and most gratefully...</i>

1477
02:02:11,023 --> 02:02:16,222
接受提名，成为国家最高领导人
accept this nomination
for the highest office in our land

1478
02:02:23,069 --> 02:02:25,938
我们都充分地意识到
It is with a full awareness

1479
02:02:25,938 --> 02:02:30,543
摆在我们国家面前的这四年
that the four years
that lie ahead for this country

1480
02:02:30,543 --> 02:02:34,146
从某种意义上来说，是决定性的四年
<i>are, in a sense, the crucial years.</i>

1481
02:02:34,146 --> 02:02:39,985
按照Churchill先生的一句话来说...
The years, if I may borrow
Mr. Churchill's phrase...

1482
02:02:39,985 --> 02:02:42,121
