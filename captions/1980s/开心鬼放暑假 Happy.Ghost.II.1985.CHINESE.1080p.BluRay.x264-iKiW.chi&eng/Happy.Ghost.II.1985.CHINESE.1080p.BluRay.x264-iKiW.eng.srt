1
00:01:10,292 --> 00:01:12,559
It was the Ching Dynasty,

2
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:17,143
an unhappy scholar of Guang Dong Province,

3
00:01:17,167 --> 00:01:21,500
who couldn't pass the country exam
for the 14th time

4
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:25,309
Even his wife had run away for good

5
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:28,601
He was so sad and depressed,

6
00:01:28,625 --> 00:01:32,958
he killed himself in an old temple

7
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:38,184
But due to an unintended but

8
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:41,018
pre-arranged co-incident

9
00:01:41,042 --> 00:01:42,684
This ghost

10
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:46,559
who could not yet be reincarnated

11
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:49,351
was brought to the city by three girls

12
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:53,309
So something extraordinary but quite normal

13
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:56,583
happened between them

14
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:17,143
From the three girls

15
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:19,809
Chu learn the way of life

16
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:23,226
He felt at ease all at once

17
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:28,833
He had decided to reincarnate
& become a new man

18
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:31,809
This newly born "Happy ghost"

19
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,309
For the good deeds he had done,

20
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:39,708
was a man of many gifts

21
00:02:41,083 --> 00:02:43,542
No milk today!

22
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:58,500
Satin's baby!

23
00:03:26,208 --> 00:03:27,226
Is it fun?

24
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,309
He can't catch me

25
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,542
Teacher!

26
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,958
You're doomed!

27
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:20,226
Although Sam Hong, the happy ghost,

28
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,184
had supernatural powers

29
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:25,667
He was not a happy man

30
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:02,934
Packing up, Miss?

31
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:05,250
The early bird gets the worms!

32
00:05:12,583 --> 00:05:14,792
Wait for me, Chairman!

33
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,559
Do I look like Akina?

34
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:36,583
You look like Shitkina!

35
00:05:36,958 --> 00:05:38,042
Bitch!

36
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:42,833
Wait for me, Chairman!

37
00:05:44,042 --> 00:05:45,125
Chairman!

38
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,042
Go away...

39
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,250
I'll have fish balls!

40
00:05:56,292 --> 00:05:58,059
Then for just $5, it's cheap!

41
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,184
Uncle Tang is such a nice man!

42
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:03,018
Uncle doesn't need that much money

43
00:06:03,042 --> 00:06:04,809
It's just for you!

44
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:05,875
Drumstick please!

45
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:08,875
US$20

46
00:06:09,375 --> 00:06:11,500
Thank you!

47
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,643
What a loss of face, Chairman

48
00:06:17,667 --> 00:06:19,042
It's a shame!

49
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:28,560
Are you new here?

50
00:06:28,584 --> 00:06:29,934
What's your name?

51
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:33,184
My name is Yiu, King Yiu

52
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:35,393
What a name? Are you from Taiwan?

53
00:06:35,417 --> 00:06:36,809
Or Red Indian!

54
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:40,417
I'm from Guang Zhou, the new comer

55
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:42,976
The new comer!

56
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,018
| love to take care of newcomers

57
00:06:46,042 --> 00:06:47,292
You're in luck!

58
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:50,143
Do you want to join the club?

59
00:06:50,167 --> 00:06:52,018
I've no religion!

60
00:06:52,042 --> 00:06:53,500
No, don't the church!

61
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,060
You mean a triad society?

62
00:06:56,084 --> 00:06:57,309
No! No! No!

63
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,393
It's the Meanies Club!

64
00:06:59,417 --> 00:07:01,226
The Meanies Club?!

65
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,851
That's right and I'm the Chairman!

66
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:05,268
The Vice Chairman!

67
00:07:05,292 --> 00:07:07,351
The Deputy Vice Chairman!

68
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,018
The goal of the Club is...

69
00:07:10,042 --> 00:07:11,809
Do only the mean things

70
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:13,601
The meaner the better

71
00:07:13,625 --> 00:07:16,309
But eating and sleeping are not mean

72
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:17,518
Why do you do it?

73
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:18,559
Ha!

74
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:19,809
Ha! Ha!

75
00:07:19,833 --> 00:07:21,018
Ha! Ha! Ha!

76
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:23,768
Eating in class, sister

77
00:07:23,792 --> 00:07:26,333
Sleeping in the exam, aren't they mean?

78
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,184
It's awful!

79
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,809
Look, if you refuse to join us,

80
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,434
you are mean to us

81
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:36,684
When you are mean to us, we will be...

82
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,417
mean to you!

83
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:41,976
It's alright!

84
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,476
Dancing!

85
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,726
Singing!

86
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,875
Copying in the examination!

87
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:50,894
Who do you think would dare

88
00:07:50,918 --> 00:07:52,393
to take Miss Lim's place

89
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:54,434
After we've driven her away?

90
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:57,601
Miss Lam! Miss Shark!
Miss Chin and Miss Flatage!

91
00:07:57,625 --> 00:08:00,292
Miss Gossip! Miss Ugly! Miss Crocodile!

92
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:01,352
We've driven 7 teachers

93
00:08:01,376 --> 00:08:04,059
away this year

94
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:07,309
Form Master, your name is weakness!

95
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:09,184
Bad news, my lord!

96
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,309
I've just heard the news
from the teacher's room

97
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,351
The new Form Master is coming today

98
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,643
It's no big deal!

99
00:08:15,667 --> 00:08:17,417
It is! "He is not a woman"

100
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:20,643
That's right, not a woman

101
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,708
| know... he must be a man!

102
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:28,750
Nuts, of course he is a man!

103
00:08:42,583 --> 00:08:44,184
Beside Arts Subject

104
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:46,018
he also teaches PT!

105
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:47,268
A man!

106
00:08:47,292 --> 00:08:48,976
He might take advantage of us!

107
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,917
You? Forget it!

108
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,042
Unbelievable!

109
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:16,208
Help!

110
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:21,333
Look, we'll kill her this time!

111
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,184
Chairman, please don't be mean to me

112
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,226
I've decided to join your club

113
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:31,101
Okay, you have my
permission to be mean like us

114
00:09:31,125 --> 00:09:32,102
The target now is to be

115
00:09:32,126 --> 00:09:34,601
mean to the new Form Master

116
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:36,851
What does he look like?

117
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:39,559
What'll a nice teacher
be doing in a school like this?

118
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,143
| hope he is tougher than Rocky

119
00:09:41,167 --> 00:09:42,060
and handsome as Robert Redford

120
00:09:42,084 --> 00:09:43,667
That would be perfect

121
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:48,226
For me, he should be slim and tall

122
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:51,018
honest with

123
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:52,625
excellent taste

124
00:09:54,042 --> 00:09:55,292
Look!

125
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:18,434
Class, I'm your new Form Master!

126
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:20,434
My name is Sam Hong!

127
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:23,476
This is my first job
after College of Education

128
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,667
| hope we can get along happily!

129
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:36,500
Hey you, no drinking in class

130
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,167
You can't listen to the radio

131
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,809
He's mean to us!

132
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:44,934
He's a dead duck!

133
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,309
Let me show you some exercises

134
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,917
I'll demonstrate and you'll follow

135
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,934
Come on! It's old fashion!

136
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,000
We're not kindergarten!

137
00:11:02,542 --> 00:11:04,393
These are the basic warm-up only

138
00:11:04,417 --> 00:11:07,250
Can you show us something more difficult?

139
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,208
I'm afraid it's too difficult for you

140
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,809
You're not scared, are you?

141
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,583
Okay, watch!

142
00:11:27,917 --> 00:11:29,018
Lets do it!

143
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:30,083
Okay!

144
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:49,042
Today I'll show you how to play basketball

145
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,351
This is a basketball

146
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:53,809
Bull shit!

147
00:11:53,833 --> 00:11:56,226
It's called a basketball

148
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,958
because there is a basket and a ball

149
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,143
Would you please tell me

150
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:05,476
What is a basketball?

151
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,268
It's round and it bounces!

152
00:12:08,292 --> 00:12:11,143
He's insulting your IQ, Chairman!

153
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:14,143
That's right, your IQ is just that much

154
00:12:14,167 --> 00:12:16,059
A international Standard Basketball

155
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:21,934
it's diameter is 28 cm and weigh 0.5 kg

156
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,583
As for bounce...

157
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:28,018
It's no use talking, sir

158
00:12:28,042 --> 00:12:30,333
You've got to shoot through the basket!

159
00:12:33,083 --> 00:12:37,292
Good...!

160
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:41,351
Not bad, considering your age

161
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:43,726
Quit the sweet-talk!

162
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:44,602
Sweet-talk?

163
00:12:44,626 --> 00:12:47,226
Can you show us

164
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,875
a couple of shots, sir!

165
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:50,559
Tell you

166
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,875
But save your applause of I miss!

167
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:04,292
That's a shot you should learn!

168
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,643
Hurray for the master!

169
00:13:17,667 --> 00:13:20,393
I've fallen back for lack of practice

170
00:13:20,417 --> 00:13:24,917
Hurray for the master, encore...!

171
00:13:25,542 --> 00:13:27,625
Teacher is this!

172
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:36,167
Hey! I'll beat you, bitch

173
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:47,792
I'm beautiful...

174
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,958
Here comes the teacher...!

175
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,917
Good morning, class!

176
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:07,125
Good morning, sir!

177
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:15,792
Keep quiet, everybody!

178
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,083
Quiet!

179
00:14:23,208 --> 00:14:24,917
Quiet!

180
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:28,875
Come on... make some noises!

181
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,083
Roll Call!

182
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:35,708
Pretty Wong!

183
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,143
Two Prettys in the class?

184
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:41,809
No, I want to go to the toilet!

185
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,167
Me too!

186
00:14:43,625 --> 00:14:45,125
Okay and hurry back!

187
00:14:48,292 --> 00:14:50,208
Yan Tao May!

188
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,893
Stop playing games, will you?

189
00:14:53,917 --> 00:14:54,727
| just want to tell you

190
00:14:54,751 --> 00:14:57,143
May Yan has just walked out!

191
00:14:57,167 --> 00:14:58,309
Yeah!

192
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,309
Alright, don't raise your hand

193
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,708
unless you're called!

194
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,917
Thatcher!

195
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,583
Thatcher!

196
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,500
King Yiu!

197
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,250
King Yiu!

198
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,893
Okay, let's try the new way

199
00:15:21,917 --> 00:15:24,268
Absentees please raise their hands!

200
00:15:24,292 --> 00:15:26,875
So everyone is present!

201
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,833
Then let's start the lecture

202
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,667
Is this the welcome present
for your new teacher?

203
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,226
No wonder you've driven
7 teachers away already?

204
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:57,934
We didn't drive them away

205
00:15:57,958 --> 00:15:59,726
They're weak

206
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,309
They can't stand the new generation

207
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,500
nor the pressure of modern society

208
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:07,059
Why do you enjoy tricking people?

209
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,643
Why don't you study while you can?

210
00:16:09,667 --> 00:16:12,101
The poor in the ancient time

211
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:14,976
Ancient people break a
wall for light to study

212
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,059
Break what wall?

213
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,417
To expose what the neighbours are doing?

214
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:21,768
It must be exotic

215
00:16:21,792 --> 00:16:23,333
"Blowup"!

216
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,833
You have a dirty mind, sir!

217
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:28,726
Dirty mind? Who?

218
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:30,851
The master!

219
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,809
Dirty stories in class

220
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,601
I'll report you to the Head Mistress!

221
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,101
Go back to your seat!

222
00:16:36,125 --> 00:16:37,583
Go back!

223
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,083
You don't have to yell!

224
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,792
Go back!

225
00:16:51,792 --> 00:16:54,018
Who're you trying to scare?

226
00:16:54,042 --> 00:16:55,375
Silly nonsense!

227
00:16:56,542 --> 00:16:58,768
Sam, get hold of yourself

228
00:16:58,792 --> 00:17:00,625
Teaching is not done with violence

229
00:17:01,583 --> 00:17:03,143
| didn't hit them

230
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:04,393
| just hit the table!

231
00:17:04,417 --> 00:17:06,268
I'd rather you hit them

232
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,226
They would be cured

233
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:10,393
A broken table can't be repaired!

234
00:17:10,417 --> 00:17:11,934
They may be naughty!

235
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:14,958
But you shouldn't use violence!

236
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,809
Students coming to school

237
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,417
are our customers

238
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,101
You're the salesman!

239
00:17:22,125 --> 00:17:24,768
You can't treat customers like this!

240
00:17:24,792 --> 00:17:27,309
He takes the school for a department store

241
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,809
| disagree!

242
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,934
But I think it's more like a hospital

243
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,667
Some come in and some go out

244
00:17:35,167 --> 00:17:37,434
Some alive, some died!

245
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:39,934
| wish to have peace

246
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,351
and quiet in the hospital

247
00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:42,625
I'm Sorry!

248
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:45,934
Try to love your patients

249
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:47,000
Yes!

250
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:48,893
I'm many years your senior

251
00:17:48,917 --> 00:17:51,018
But we are from the same college

252
00:17:51,042 --> 00:17:52,518
Please don't fail me!

253
00:17:52,542 --> 00:17:53,583
Yes!

254
00:17:54,292 --> 00:17:55,958
That's all!

255
00:17:56,542 --> 00:17:58,917
Cost of repair will be deducted
from your salary

256
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,125
What happen?

257
00:18:06,833 --> 00:18:08,875
So you've lost your appetite?

258
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,083
No!

259
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:14,643
Let's face it

260
00:18:14,667 --> 00:18:16,875
You're not the first one

261
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:20,893
They're still kids

262
00:18:20,917 --> 00:18:23,018
They are lovely!

263
00:18:23,042 --> 00:18:26,375
They like to play games and have fun!

264
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:29,708
| can't stand it anymore!

265
00:18:31,042 --> 00:18:34,601
But that will lead you nowhere!

266
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:38,393
Actually, their tricks are really simple

267
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,018
The same old things

268
00:18:41,042 --> 00:18:45,125
Chalk, duster, glue and needles...

269
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:50,226
Would you please give me some advice

270
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:52,976
so that I'll be well-prepared for them

271
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,226
Sit down

272
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,083
and let me tell you

273
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:18,875
"I'll be with you all night"

274
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,542
Disgusting!

275
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,333
Who looks nice?

276
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,476
None!

277
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,851
The girls from St Holy
are famous for their quality!

278
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,768
They are the best

279
00:19:30,792 --> 00:19:33,250
in the neighbourhood!

280
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,000
Oh my God!

281
00:19:36,917 --> 00:19:39,684
What about the one in white

282
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,059
They're all in white nuts!

283
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,167
| am talking about...

284
00:19:45,042 --> 00:19:46,542
The one on the left hand side

285
00:19:47,792 --> 00:19:50,393
She has such a good appetite

286
00:19:50,417 --> 00:19:52,417
| like the one next to her

287
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:56,184
She's the chairman of their Meanies Club!

288
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,643
She's tough!

289
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:00,726
But it's exciting too!

290
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,542
| like the one with the mirror

291
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:06,685
Chairman!

292
00:20:06,709 --> 00:20:07,851
The three stooges

293
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,750
are staring at us!

294
00:20:14,042 --> 00:20:16,268
The monks from the Boy's school

295
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:18,434
Operation Mean, Chairman!

296
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:21,167
It's too late, they've made their move!

297
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,750
Go!

298
00:20:27,417 --> 00:20:29,500
Go!

299
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,268
...No...

300
00:20:36,292 --> 00:20:40,309
They...

301
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:44,750
Calm down, kid!

302
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:51,184
Sit down!

303
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:55,434
Don't let your nerve ruin your image, boy!

304
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,351
Is it your

305
00:20:57,375 --> 00:21:00,083
first time?

306
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,101
Yes... No...

307
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:07,059
They want to date you...

308
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:07,685
Me?

309
00:21:07,709 --> 00:21:10,601
No, all of you!

310
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:11,269
To have a date?

311
00:21:11,293 --> 00:21:13,851
To go for a walk!

312
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:16,643
To go for a walk, like holding hands?

313
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:17,726
No problem

314
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:20,643
People say once you get acquainted

315
00:21:20,667 --> 00:21:22,059
You can be good friends!

316
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:24,268
But we want to go in a car

317
00:21:24,292 --> 00:21:25,667
Do you have one, boy?

318
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:29,309
Of course we have one!

319
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,351
It's my father's car...

320
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,809
He bought it for you!

321
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:35,101
When will you be free?

322
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,268
Tonight!

323
00:21:36,292 --> 00:21:38,476
No, it's Grandma's Birthday!

324
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:39,435
My mother says...

325
00:21:39,459 --> 00:21:42,184
Quit the bullshit!

326
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:45,000
Let's make it tonight after school or never

327
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,643
Let's go!

328
00:21:46,667 --> 00:21:48,250
Bye!

329
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,059
Do they mean it?

330
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,601
What next, Chairman?

331
00:21:53,625 --> 00:21:55,500
We'll teach them a lesson tonight

332
00:21:55,917 --> 00:21:56,769
I mean a lesson!

333
00:21:56,793 --> 00:21:58,458
They should have it!

334
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,226
My father needs the car

335
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:10,601
before eight tonight

336
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,059
or he'll kill me!

337
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:13,583
Shut up! They're coming!

338
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:16,042
They're coming!

339
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:20,226
This is it!

340
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,226
A 7-seater, Rolls Royce, spacious!

341
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,708
In please!

342
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,500
You've done it this time!

343
00:22:30,292 --> 00:22:33,976
It's exciting to sit at the front

344
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,417
But it's safer to sit at the back

345
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:47,542
For you

346
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:49,917
Where is my flower?

347
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:55,684
Have a drink!

348
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:57,643
It's my father's...

349
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,851
His father reserves for his guests

350
00:22:59,875 --> 00:23:01,417
Help yourself with the bread!

351
00:23:02,083 --> 00:23:03,434
My father...

352
00:23:03,458 --> 00:23:05,667
Your father told you to drive carefully!

353
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,893
Let me introduce ourselves

354
00:23:08,917 --> 00:23:10,601
My name is Poon On

355
00:23:10,625 --> 00:23:13,208
Everybody calls me Don Juan

356
00:23:14,125 --> 00:23:16,184
He is Daisy Ko!

357
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:17,583
What? Dizzy Ko?

358
00:23:18,125 --> 00:23:19,934
My Chinese name is terrible!

359
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:21,851
My English name really suits me

360
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,726
It's Michael Jackson

361
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:24,750
Ko!

362
00:23:25,917 --> 00:23:26,769
What's yours?

363
00:23:26,793 --> 00:23:29,351
I'm Akina!

364
00:23:29,375 --> 00:23:30,851
Akina?

365
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:32,393
I used to be Aisy!

366
00:23:32,417 --> 00:23:33,976
Switch places with me!

367
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,059
Anything to do with AIDS?

368
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,292
My name is Herby

369
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,768
Where're you taking us, handsome?

370
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:43,208
To Paidu!

371
00:23:45,083 --> 00:23:48,476
We'll go swinging at the park!

372
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,167
You go yourself!

373
00:23:50,792 --> 00:23:53,268
You boys are not being romantic!

374
00:23:53,292 --> 00:23:54,542
Romantic?

375
00:23:54,792 --> 00:23:58,309
Romance is a summer day's sunset

376
00:23:58,333 --> 00:24:00,268
Going to the beach

377
00:24:00,292 --> 00:24:02,393
listening to the waves

378
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:04,643
Watching the sea

379
00:24:04,667 --> 00:24:07,833
Leaving your footprint in the sand

380
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:12,333
Daisy, go for the romantic ride!

381
00:24:24,292 --> 00:24:25,625
I'm scared

382
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,250
It's lovely!

383
00:24:30,833 --> 00:24:31,851
Do you know what romance is now?

384
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:35,434
Of course, I always knew!

385
00:24:35,458 --> 00:24:38,059
Yeah, that's really romantic!

386
00:24:38,083 --> 00:24:41,476
Not yet, it's even morn if we go swimming!

387
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,643
Count me in!

388
00:24:42,667 --> 00:24:43,644
Me too!

389
00:24:43,668 --> 00:24:45,309
Hey, how about it?

390
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:48,476
We don't have our swimsuit!

391
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,559
Either do we!

392
00:24:50,583 --> 00:24:52,500
But the coast is clear!

393
00:24:57,375 --> 00:24:59,042
Let's strip!

394
00:25:03,875 --> 00:25:05,643
Aren't you coming?

395
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:07,458
No, it's too cold!

396
00:25:07,792 --> 00:25:10,351
No, it's not cold!

397
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:11,833
Let me show you!

398
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:16,583
Let me show you!

399
00:25:24,042 --> 00:25:25,559
The water is nice!

400
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:27,917
It's like a spring!

401
00:25:28,208 --> 00:25:29,976
Come on down!

402
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,833
Grab the clothes!

403
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:38,184
What're you doing?

404
00:25:38,208 --> 00:25:39,917
Come on!

405
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,667
Oh! Don't take our clothes!

406
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:45,125
Let's go, Chairman!

407
00:25:45,625 --> 00:25:47,458
Don't go!

408
00:25:51,333 --> 00:25:53,875
Bye!

409
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:56,625
Oh no, my father's car!

410
00:26:12,833 --> 00:26:14,458
You see!

411
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:16,560
So many tickets?

412
00:26:16,584 --> 00:26:18,042
Oh no...

413
00:26:18,958 --> 00:26:20,559
Look!

414
00:26:20,583 --> 00:26:22,184
That's the end of me

415
00:26:22,208 --> 00:26:26,167
I'm sorry, father!

416
00:26:27,833 --> 00:26:29,518
We have fixed those monks

417
00:26:29,542 --> 00:26:30,833
real good this time!

418
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,643
Shut up and give me a hand!

419
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:36,976
What are you doing?

420
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,059
This is the latest BB Glue

421
00:26:39,083 --> 00:26:42,125
It will tear his pants off!

422
00:26:42,750 --> 00:26:44,333
Aren't we going too far?

423
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:46,101
Too far?

424
00:26:46,125 --> 00:26:48,726
You haven't been too cooperative lately!

425
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,602
Aren't you?

426
00:26:49,626 --> 00:26:50,643
No!

427
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:54,476
In order to show your loyalty to the club

428
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:58,042
You are to put this "Thing" in his drawer

429
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,268
Don't panic, it's the
latest Japanese Product

430
00:27:01,292 --> 00:27:03,351
Soft plastic toy mouse

431
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:04,601
Looks real!

432
00:27:04,625 --> 00:27:06,434
It looks real!

433
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:07,792
It's ugly!

434
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,268
Hurry and put it in his drawer

435
00:27:10,292 --> 00:27:11,958
and scare the hell out of him

436
00:27:12,542 --> 00:27:14,042
Hurry up!

437
00:27:17,917 --> 00:27:19,708
Keep on, Keep on!

438
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:32,667
Here come the teacher!

439
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:55,708
Damn!

440
00:27:56,958 --> 00:27:58,333
Good morning, class!

441
00:28:17,917 --> 00:28:20,726
Thank you very much
for your welcoming applause!

442
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:22,018
Here are your homework book

443
00:28:22,042 --> 00:28:24,208
Give them the homework

444
00:28:36,625 --> 00:28:37,625
Stand still!

445
00:28:38,250 --> 00:28:39,601
Are you on roller skate?

446
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:41,601
We're living in

447
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:43,101
a fast commercial world

448
00:28:43,125 --> 00:28:45,375
What's wrong with efficiency?

449
00:28:47,125 --> 00:28:49,042
Nothing, go on!

450
00:28:58,292 --> 00:28:59,434
Sir, I...

451
00:28:59,458 --> 00:29:02,125
Raise your hand before you talk

452
00:29:03,333 --> 00:29:04,144
Sir, I...

453
00:29:04,168 --> 00:29:06,018
Only suspects raise their hands

454
00:29:06,042 --> 00:29:07,125
for the police!

455
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:10,226
Can we turn on the fan?

456
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,292
Yes!

457
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,083
We lost again!

458
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:27,934
It's Art today

459
00:29:27,958 --> 00:29:30,792
You will sketch a person

460
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:36,167
Entitled "The one you love"

461
00:29:50,167 --> 00:29:52,101
So sketch you loved ones

462
00:29:52,125 --> 00:29:54,184
It can be your father, mother

463
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:55,792
or teacher

464
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,292
Oh no, not the teacher

465
00:30:34,292 --> 00:30:36,726
Shit, he put on two pairs of pants!

466
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,583
Damn, damn, damn!

467
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:41,434
That's the end of that!

468
00:30:41,458 --> 00:30:42,643
| hope this kind of trick

469
00:30:42,667 --> 00:30:44,351
will not happen in this classroom again

470
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:46,143
We don't know sketching, Sir!

471
00:30:46,167 --> 00:30:47,184
Would you care to show us?

472
00:30:47,208 --> 00:30:49,351
Yeah, demonstrate!

473
00:30:49,375 --> 00:30:50,750
Alright...!

474
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,934
The duster is in the drawer

475
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:03,518
Yeah, the drawer!

476
00:31:03,542 --> 00:31:04,875
OK...

477
00:31:08,458 --> 00:31:10,393
Oh my god, it's a mouse!

478
00:31:10,417 --> 00:31:14,042
A real mouse

479
00:31:15,667 --> 00:31:17,917
I'm so scared!

480
00:31:18,292 --> 00:31:20,667
It's a fake, dummy!

481
00:31:21,792 --> 00:31:23,059
This one is real

482
00:31:23,083 --> 00:31:24,875
The fake is over here

483
00:31:39,292 --> 00:31:40,833
Help...!

484
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,351
What's happening?

485
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:50,143
Nothing!

486
00:31:50,167 --> 00:31:51,434
There's a mouse in the class!

487
00:31:51,458 --> 00:31:52,875
Mouse?

488
00:31:53,625 --> 00:31:56,851
Help...!

489
00:31:56,875 --> 00:31:58,583
I'm so scared!

490
00:32:00,875 --> 00:32:03,934
Mr Hong told us to join the Aquatic Meet

491
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:05,417
He said he'll teach us to swim

492
00:32:09,083 --> 00:32:11,559
We haven't been too good to him!

493
00:32:11,583 --> 00:32:13,518
Which said are you on?

494
00:32:13,542 --> 00:32:16,393
You're not having a crush on him, are you?

495
00:32:16,417 --> 00:32:18,184
Of course not!

496
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:19,226
We're no good at swimming

497
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:20,750
We play volleyball better

498
00:32:21,375 --> 00:32:23,643
At the inter-school competition

499
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:25,250
We'll be the champion!

500
00:32:35,125 --> 00:32:36,726
Don't you recognise us?

501
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:39,518
Not with your clothes on!

502
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:41,059
You got him into real bad trouble!

503
00:32:41,083 --> 00:32:43,333
My father beat me up for it

504
00:32:44,792 --> 00:32:46,125
What do you want?

505
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,227
Want?

506
00:32:47,251 --> 00:32:48,667
To get even!

507
00:32:56,917 --> 00:32:59,143
You better apologise

508
00:32:59,167 --> 00:33:00,851
Apologise? Ha!

509
00:33:00,875 --> 00:33:01,852
Ha! Ha!

510
00:33:01,876 --> 00:33:03,208
Ha! Ha! Ha!

511
00:33:04,667 --> 00:33:06,101
Ha! Ha! Ha! Ha!

512
00:33:06,125 --> 00:33:08,351
They're laughing at us

513
00:33:08,375 --> 00:33:10,667
Where're you people from?

514
00:33:14,667 --> 00:33:17,417
Can't you see their school ties, Sir

515
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:23,708
So you're from the neighbourhood

516
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,434
You three mad dogs

517
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:28,500
What do you want from our girls?

518
00:33:29,833 --> 00:33:30,644
So you're their teacher?

519
00:33:30,668 --> 00:33:31,851
Did you teach them?

520
00:33:31,875 --> 00:33:33,018
To be a thief?

521
00:33:33,042 --> 00:33:34,143
Can you prove it?

522
00:33:34,167 --> 00:33:36,750
They're the witnesses! This is your proof

523
00:33:37,625 --> 00:33:39,500
| don't care what's wrong?

524
00:33:40,250 --> 00:33:43,226
But I'll give you one minute to disappear

525
00:33:43,250 --> 00:33:44,726
What if we don't?

526
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:45,602
You won't?

527
00:33:45,626 --> 00:33:47,000
That's right!

528
00:33:47,667 --> 00:33:49,708
If you don't leave, we will!

529
00:33:51,583 --> 00:33:52,833
Running away!

530
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,375
We'll beat him, we outnumber him 3 to 1

531
00:34:09,958 --> 00:34:11,583
Who threw the ball at me?

532
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:17,476
Who do you think you are?

533
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,018
You're only a teacher!

534
00:34:19,042 --> 00:34:20,809
What I really hate is a teacher

535
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:22,708
Because...!

536
00:34:27,583 --> 00:34:28,476
Running away!

537
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,269
Let's go...!

538
00:34:29,293 --> 00:34:31,351
None of my business!

539
00:34:31,375 --> 00:34:33,625
Go to hell!

540
00:34:38,917 --> 00:34:41,101
You were wrong to break the table

541
00:34:41,125 --> 00:34:42,601
You even beat up our neighbour's students,

542
00:34:42,625 --> 00:34:44,458
what's up?

543
00:34:45,208 --> 00:34:46,393
| didn't mean it

544
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,934
It's embarrassing

545
00:34:47,958 --> 00:34:50,417
We've such a good relationship
with their school

546
00:34:51,042 --> 00:34:53,268
and now their Form
Mistress calls to complain

547
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:55,833
And request compensation!

548
00:34:59,125 --> 00:35:01,667
| know, I'll apologise to her in person

549
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:28,268
Are you Miss Lo?

550
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:29,708
Yes, I am!

551
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,125
Who are you, mister?

552
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,833
My name is Hong

553
00:35:40,625 --> 00:35:44,434
I'm their class mister...

554
00:35:44,458 --> 00:35:45,684
I'm their teacher!

555
00:35:45,708 --> 00:35:48,226
The school next door

556
00:35:48,250 --> 00:35:51,708
So you're the one who hurt my boys

557
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,643
What're you doing here?

558
00:35:54,667 --> 00:35:57,333
Nothing... I just came here to...

559
00:35:59,292 --> 00:36:00,476
What?

560
00:36:00,500 --> 00:36:03,667
Nothing... let me help you!

561
00:36:06,917 --> 00:36:08,643
You've lost your sleeve

562
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,792
Let me help you put it back on

563
00:36:11,208 --> 00:36:13,083
Don't come any closer!

564
00:36:15,417 --> 00:36:17,393
| just want to help you It's alright!

565
00:36:17,417 --> 00:36:18,684
Help you...

566
00:36:18,708 --> 00:36:20,958
No!

567
00:36:22,042 --> 00:36:25,333
You are so annoying, go away!

568
00:36:27,750 --> 00:36:30,333
Let me fix it!

569
00:36:30,792 --> 00:36:32,592
Did Miss Lo make a
complaint to their school?

570
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,458
He tried to kill the witness!

571
00:36:35,875 --> 00:36:37,934

"It's like a flying kite"

714
00:51:32,958 --> 00:51:39,583
"Suddenly breaks apart and drifts in air"

715
00:51:39,917 --> 00:51:45,125

Not for us, for Miss Lo

725
00:52:30,542 --> 00:52:31,684
Why doesn't she buy it herself?

726
00:52:31,708 --> 00:52:33,518
She asked you to buy it for her?

727
00:52:33,542 --> 00:52:34,519

Terrible?

759
00:55:13,625 --> 00:55:17,059
In the Ching Dynasty, I'm a real gentleman

760
00:55:17,083 --> 00:55:18,476
Kind and gentle,

761
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:21,851
| wanted to join the government

762
00:55:21,875 --> 00:55:24,250
But I failed and died in grief

763
00:55:25,250 --> 00:55:27,476
Fortunately, I was a kind man

764
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:29,184
and charitable man

765
00:55:29,208 --> 00:55:31,958
That's why you're gifted with super powers

766
00:55:34,125 --> 00:55:36,250
So the power was given by you

767
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:38,059
Correct!

768
00:55:38,083 --> 00:55:39,809
You've really set me up!

769
00:55:39,833 --> 00:55:41,601
| was kicked out of school

770
00:55:41,625 --> 00:55:43,184
Kicked out of football matches

771
00:55:43,208 --> 00:55:44,684
| had to compensate for
medical fees in fights

772
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:47,351
| paid for breakage in my work

773
00:55:47,375 --> 00:55:48,708
| was a pervert with girls

774
00:55:48,833 --> 00:55:49,976
All because of you!

775
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,583
Don't get too excited!

776
00:55:53,375 --> 00:55:55,851
Thank you very much for your super powers

777
00:55:55,875 --> 00:55:57,393
Please take it back!

778
00:55:57,417 --> 00:56:00,125
| want to be normal!

779
00:56:00,292 --> 00:56:05,542
To be normal...!

780
00:56:06,625 --> 00:56:11,625
To be normal...!

781
00:56:16,708 --> 00:56:18,792
Damn, I am late!

782
00:56:31,208 --> 00:56:32,476
It was thundering last night

783
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:35,167
Too bad Mr Hong had to sleep alone!

784
00:56:36,625 --> 00:56:40,125
A toast for the grand
achievement of the club!

785
00:56:40,792 --> 00:56:42,667
Cheers!

786
00:56:44,958 --> 00:56:46,958
Come and have a drink, sir!

787
00:56:49,542 --> 00:56:50,917
Sit down!

788
00:56:57,875 --> 00:56:59,958
So you're celebrating your nasty tricks!

789
00:57:01,417 --> 00:57:03,333
You people are hopeless

790
00:57:04,125 --> 00:57:06,351
You don't really deserve my love to you

791
00:57:06,375 --> 00:57:10,958
Love to us? You love only Miss Lo!

792
00:57:21,958 --> 00:57:23,479
You only know how to make a fool of me

793
00:57:24,208 --> 00:57:27,851
Can't you do anything decent

794
00:57:27,875 --> 00:57:30,750
Didn't we win the Aquatic Meet!

795
00:57:32,750 --> 00:57:34,851
If I didn't apply my super powers

796
00:57:34,875 --> 00:57:35,810
You'll win nothing

797
00:57:35,834 --> 00:57:38,792
Super powers? Can you
believe that? Can you?

798
00:57:41,875 --> 00:57:44,708
| never lie, let me show you

799
00:57:45,542 --> 00:57:46,792
Open the door!

800
00:57:49,417 --> 00:57:50,583
Headmaster!

801
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:52,292
| thought you're late!

802
00:57:58,542 --> 00:57:59,851
Stop the face!

803
00:57:59,875 --> 00:58:03,042
Superman! I thought you're impudent

804
00:58:05,625 --> 00:58:07,083
Don't laugh!

805
00:58:09,875 --> 00:58:11,333
Don't laugh...!

806
00:58:22,583 --> 00:58:23,917
The fan!

807
00:58:26,833 --> 00:58:28,042
Duster!

808
00:58:30,792 --> 00:58:32,208
I'm normal!

809
00:58:33,625 --> 00:58:36,625
I'm normal...!

810
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:42,393
I'm so happy, I've become normal!

811
00:58:42,417 --> 00:58:44,059
Let me buy you all lunch

812
00:58:44,083 --> 00:58:46,750
Help yourselves!

813
00:58:47,375 --> 00:58:49,893
I'm normal...!

814
00:58:49,917 --> 00:58:52,434
Is he actually normal or not

815
00:58:52,458 --> 00:58:54,143
He has never been normal!

816
00:58:54,167 --> 00:58:56,143
It must be us!

817
00:58:56,167 --> 00:58:57,917
He's gone crazy!

818
00:59:03,583 --> 00:59:05,667
Let's eat!

819
00:59:11,792 --> 00:59:13,125
Where's uncle Tang?

820
00:59:20,417 --> 00:59:24,059
The price is too much

821
00:59:24,083 --> 00:59:25,458
Where has Tang gone?

822
00:59:27,458 --> 00:59:34,125
Bread, soft drinks, lunch box!

823
00:59:34,375 --> 00:59:36,708
Lunch box $20, soft drinks!

824
00:59:38,667 --> 00:59:40,167
Sir!

825
00:59:46,208 --> 00:59:48,125
What's going on?

826
00:59:48,417 --> 00:59:50,976
| was on leave for three days

827
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,375
They fired me when I came back

828
00:59:55,167 --> 00:59:56,833
No wonder prices have gone up so quickly

829
00:59:57,708 --> 01:00:01,268
They called this Modern Management

830
01:00:01,292 --> 01:00:03,583
To increase the profit of the school!

831
01:00:04,125 --> 01:00:06,083
| must talk to the Headmistress

832
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:07,750
It's no use

833
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:11,708
The Headmistress trusted the Deputy

834
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:15,333
He tried to get rid of
me for quite some time

835
01:00:16,167 --> 01:00:18,167
That is his nephew

836
01:00:19,208 --> 01:00:21,500
Up there, go up

837
01:00:21,625 --> 01:00:25,167
The Deputy knows only money

838
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:30,917
You better stay here from now on

839
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:34,833
We'll buy 40 cans of drinks!

840
01:00:38,667 --> 01:00:40,708
Let's finish it!

841
01:00:42,958 --> 01:00:43,769
It's against school regulations

842
01:00:43,793 --> 01:00:46,393
to buy from hawkers

843
01:00:46,417 --> 01:00:48,417
You better buy it from the snack shop!

844
01:00:49,500 --> 01:00:52,000
It's me who invited them to have a drink

845
01:00:52,292 --> 01:00:56,375
Help yourselves!

846
01:01:00,792 --> 01:01:03,309
The food is cheaper over there!

847
01:01:03,333 --> 01:01:04,875
Come on!

848
01:01:12,875 --> 01:01:15,583
The food is cheaper here!

849
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:21,625
Don't go...!

850
01:01:21,875 --> 01:01:24,708
Free drinks for those who eat here!

851
01:01:28,417 --> 01:01:30,917
Please don't go!

852
01:01:38,125 --> 01:01:39,768
We've done something decent today

853
01:01:39,792 --> 01:01:41,101
We better do something mean

854
01:01:41,125 --> 01:01:42,809
or it'll be against
the principle of the club

855
01:01:42,833 --> 01:01:43,726
You're right!

856
01:01:43,750 --> 01:01:44,519
Is the letter ready?

857
01:01:44,543 --> 01:01:45,750
OK!

858
01:01:48,833 --> 01:01:50,101
Is he alone?

859
01:01:50,125 --> 01:01:51,250
Yes!

860
01:01:52,292 --> 01:01:54,393
It's the school's open day next week

861
01:01:54,417 --> 01:01:56,768
We want to invite the
boys next door to join us

862
01:01:56,792 --> 01:01:57,851
It's alright!

863
01:01:57,875 --> 01:01:59,542
And their teacher, Miss Lo!

864
01:01:59,833 --> 01:02:01,792
Miss Lo!

865
01:02:05,042 --> 01:02:07,792
The invitation cards
are ready, please sign it

866
01:02:08,083 --> 01:02:09,292
Sign it here!

867
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:11,250
Here!

868
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:19,643
It not convenient for us to go there

869
01:02:19,667 --> 01:02:22,101
Would you please give it to Miss Lo!

870
01:02:22,125 --> 01:02:23,434
Okay, I'll give it to her!

871
01:02:23,458 --> 01:02:25,125
Thank you very much!

872
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,250
Miss Lo!

873
01:02:44,833 --> 01:02:46,625
What can I do for you?

874
01:02:46,958 --> 01:02:49,042
| want to...

875
01:02:50,083 --> 01:02:51,708
See for yourself!

876
01:02:55,375 --> 01:02:57,809
Miss Lo, you're my everything

877
01:02:57,833 --> 01:02:59,559
| can't go on without you

878
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:02,875
| want to give you a big hug and kiss you

879
01:03:07,042 --> 01:03:09,393
because I am crazy about you

880
01:03:09,417 --> 01:03:11,268
| am paralysed by your love

881
01:03:11,292 --> 01:03:13,934
I'll show the world my love for you

882
01:03:13,958 --> 01:03:15,851
| heartily invite you to the orgy next week

883
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:18,792
It's my orgy open day

884
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:21,792
Orgy open day?

885
01:03:23,083 --> 01:03:24,542
Oops, it's open day!

886
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:31,101
You and me are going to have a good time

887
01:03:31,125 --> 01:03:33,434
I'll invite

888
01:03:33,458 --> 01:03:36,250
Lady P

889
01:03:41,375 --> 01:03:44,208
Crazy about you, Sam Hong

890
01:03:44,667 --> 01:03:47,143
Don't go, it's obscene!

891
01:03:47,167 --> 01:03:48,434
Obscene?

892
01:03:48,458 --> 01:03:50,143
We've done it every year,

893
01:03:50,167 --> 01:03:51,601
a lot of people come too

894
01:03:51,625 --> 01:03:53,250
You can come if you're interested!

895
01:03:53,333 --> 01:03:56,268
You can count me out!

896
01:03:56,292 --> 01:03:57,542
Mr Hong!

897
01:03:57,917 --> 01:03:59,476
Is this invitation letter
really written by you?

898
01:03:59,500 --> 01:04:01,625
Yes, can't you see my signature?

899
01:04:03,333 --> 01:04:04,351
Please come!

900
01:04:04,375 --> 01:04:06,559
And play with my girls, it's fun

901
01:04:06,583 --> 01:04:08,875
Play with yourself, you creep!

902
01:04:15,333 --> 01:04:16,875
What can I say, Sam?

903
01:04:16,917 --> 01:04:20,417
He's a low down creep!

904
01:04:21,208 --> 01:04:23,042
To write something like that

905
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:26,375
He has shamed the school

906
01:04:28,208 --> 01:04:29,518
This letter...

907
01:04:29,542 --> 01:04:31,125
It's not written by you?

908
01:04:31,375 --> 01:04:32,958
Not true!

909
01:04:33,458 --> 01:04:35,851
It's true, it's not written by me...

910
01:04:35,875 --> 01:04:38,476
It's the girls who set you up!

911
01:04:38,500 --> 01:04:40,292
You can do better than that, Sam

912
01:04:40,583 --> 01:04:41,875
Headmistress

913
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:46,727
I'm sorry, Sam!

914
01:04:46,751 --> 01:04:49,042
Yes, I understand!

915
01:04:50,875 --> 01:04:52,208
It'll be my last day here!

916
01:04:56,958 --> 01:04:59,208
It's his doomsday...!

917
01:05:01,208 --> 01:05:02,667
Sit down!

918
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:09,250
Good afternoon, Sir!

919
01:05:10,000 --> 01:05:11,875
Good afternoon, class!

920
01:05:24,625 --> 01:05:26,375
Who wrote this letter?

921
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:32,125
In fact I know who wrote it

922
01:05:32,583 --> 01:05:34,875
But I want her to admit it

923
01:05:37,542 --> 01:05:39,583
It's not a shame to
admit something you've done

924
01:05:39,792 --> 01:05:42,167
That is the code of a gentleman

925
01:05:42,583 --> 01:05:44,768
Only sneaky people

926
01:05:44,792 --> 01:05:47,667
would deny their responsibilities

927
01:05:49,083 --> 01:05:49,769
But I do believe

928
01:05:49,793 --> 01:05:52,708
nothing of the kind is here

929
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,476
It's me!

930
01:05:55,500 --> 01:05:56,542
Good!

931
01:05:56,917 --> 01:05:59,726
Don't you know

932
01:05:59,750 --> 01:06:01,208
you've made a big mistake

933
01:06:02,792 --> 01:06:04,059
Sir, I...!

934
01:06:04,083 --> 01:06:05,351
Let me tell you

935
01:06:05,375 --> 01:06:06,500
It's your grammar

936
01:06:07,458 --> 01:06:09,809
"I couldn't go on without you” is wrong

937
01:06:09,833 --> 01:06:11,458
It should be "I can't...

938
01:06:11,917 --> 01:06:14,726
It's not

939
01:06:14,750 --> 01:06:16,375
"I should invite Mr X_.."

940
01:06:17,042 --> 01:06:18,833
It should be "I shall...”

941
01:06:19,667 --> 01:06:21,375
But don't do it again

942
01:06:24,708 --> 01:06:26,292
We're Chinese

943
01:06:26,875 --> 01:06:30,250
We must be good at our mother tongue

944
01:06:35,167 --> 01:06:36,583
Maybe it's my fault

945
01:06:37,083 --> 01:06:39,042
Something is wrong with my teaching method

946
01:06:39,458 --> 01:06:41,083
| am not doing it right

947
01:06:41,708 --> 01:06:43,708
In order not to ruin your future

948
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:48,500
This is going to be my last day

949
01:06:51,083 --> 01:06:54,250
| hope the new teacher
will be better than me

950
01:06:54,708 --> 01:06:58,000
To show you the right way!

951
01:07:01,042 --> 01:07:02,958
Let's not waste more time

952
01:07:03,542 --> 01:07:05,250
Please turn to page 20

953
01:07:05,667 --> 01:07:06,833
Sir!

954
01:07:22,458 --> 01:07:23,559
So you've done

955
01:07:23,583 --> 01:07:25,708
it again!

956
01:07:27,167 --> 01:07:29,458
Damn, this is the oldest trick

957
01:07:30,042 --> 01:07:32,042
What's wrong with me?

958
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:53,750
Why are you crying?

959
01:07:54,375 --> 01:07:56,667
It's me who got fired

960
01:07:58,458 --> 01:07:59,833
Stop crying!

961
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:02,833
Your eyes will swell, won't be pretty

962
01:08:03,875 --> 01:08:05,667
The boys next door won't like it

963
01:08:13,083 --> 01:08:14,958
Sorry, sir!

964
01:08:20,208 --> 01:08:28,208
"He looks at me, he loves me"

965
01:08:29,708 --> 01:08:33,625
"He always pretend angry for me"

966
01:08:33,750 --> 01:08:41,750
"He bears the pain and smiles at me"

967
01:08:43,792 --> 01:08:51,792
"He can sacrifice himself for others"

968
01:08:53,417 --> 01:08:57,458
"He makes me feel sorry"

969
01:08:57,625 --> 01:09:05,625
"And guides me back to right way"

970
01:09:07,708 --> 01:09:15,708
"| owe him a lot but I never pay him back"

971
01:09:17,167 --> 01:09:22,958
"I fool around yesterday”

972
01:09:23,125 --> 01:09:31,125
"And I realize what's wrong today"

973
01:09:33,917 --> 01:09:41,833
"His words are like a light"

974
01:09:43,292 --> 01:09:51,292
"Always light up my life
cast away the darkness"

975
01:09:52,833 --> 01:09:56,750
"Lead me to the bright"

976
01:10:06,708 --> 01:10:08,083
What's wrong?

977
01:10:09,292 --> 01:10:10,476
What've you been doing?

978
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:12,250
You look exhausted

979
01:10:12,833 --> 01:10:14,184
What a sunny day,

980
01:10:14,208 --> 01:10:15,893
let's go to the disco!

981
01:10:15,917 --> 01:10:17,417
Daisy will pay!

982
01:10:17,500 --> 01:10:19,500
No, we don't feel like dancing

983
01:10:19,542 --> 01:10:21,809
It's not the end of the world?

984
01:10:21,833 --> 01:10:24,059
Our teacher got fired

985
01:10:24,083 --> 01:10:26,667
It must be because of you

986
01:10:30,042 --> 01:10:31,375
What's so funny?

987
01:10:31,667 --> 01:10:34,125
It's you who suggested the letter

988
01:10:34,750 --> 01:10:35,851
You don't have to yell

989
01:10:35,875 --> 01:10:37,333
| like to

990
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:39,268
But you wrote the letter

991
01:10:39,292 --> 01:10:40,768
You made me do it

992
01:10:40,792 --> 01:10:42,768
You made me do the dirty work for you

993
01:10:42,792 --> 01:10:44,333
It's your fault!

994
01:10:45,208 --> 01:10:47,583
Okay, stop yelling!

995
01:10:49,042 --> 01:10:51,458
Sit down...

996
01:10:54,167 --> 01:10:55,958
Miss Lo is out there!

997
01:11:04,500 --> 01:11:05,559
Miss Lo!

998
01:11:05,583 --> 01:11:06,560
Yes!

999
01:11:06,584 --> 01:11:09,292
Mr Hong did not write the invitation

1000
01:11:10,292 --> 01:11:11,875
It's me who did

1001
01:11:13,417 --> 01:11:14,601
He's not a bad person

1002
01:11:14,625 --> 01:11:15,893
He's not a pervert

1003
01:11:15,917 --> 01:11:18,059
He's man of affection and kind to others

1004
01:11:18,083 --> 01:11:19,559
He is great!

1005
01:11:19,583 --> 01:11:21,018
Would you help us make it up

1006
01:11:21,042 --> 01:11:22,226
He has lost his job

1007
01:11:22,250 --> 01:11:23,393
and his love

1008
01:11:23,417 --> 01:11:24,934
Everybody misunderstood him

1009
01:11:24,958 --> 01:11:26,309
but it's nothing compared to

1010
01:11:26,333 --> 01:11:27,917
your misunderstanding against him

1011
01:11:42,292 --> 01:11:44,851
We, representative of the Club

1012
01:11:44,875 --> 01:11:46,101
Apologise to you sincerely

1013
01:11:46,125 --> 01:11:47,019
We are sorry!

1014
01:11:47,043 --> 01:11:48,351
We are no good!

1015
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:50,250
Please accept our apologies!

1016
01:11:51,708 --> 01:11:53,458
It's going to be alright!

1017
01:11:54,417 --> 01:11:55,667
Come in!

1018
01:11:56,417 --> 01:11:57,434
Why aren't you

1019
01:11:57,458 --> 01:11:58,559
in school?

1020
01:11:58,583 --> 01:11:59,934
Let me do it!

1021
01:11:59,958 --> 01:12:00,958
Where's the vase?

1022
01:12:02,667 --> 01:12:04,684
We don't like the substitute teacher

1023
01:12:04,708 --> 01:12:07,434
He only knows how to swear

1024
01:12:07,458 --> 01:12:09,226
and collect money

1025
01:12:09,250 --> 01:12:11,018
What did you do to him?

1026
01:12:11,042 --> 01:12:11,935
Nothing!

1027
01:12:11,959 --> 01:12:13,684
It's agreed by all members

1028
01:12:13,708 --> 01:12:15,559
We've disbanded the club

1029
01:12:15,583 --> 01:12:16,394
Is that so?

1030
01:12:16,418 --> 01:12:18,351
But we've got a new club

1031
01:12:18,375 --> 01:12:20,059
Club Unscrupulous?

1032
01:12:20,083 --> 01:12:21,833
No! No! No!

1033
01:12:22,417 --> 01:12:24,250
Club Struggle!

1034
01:12:24,667 --> 01:12:26,309
For our future!

1035
01:12:26,333 --> 01:12:27,917
For ideals!

1036
01:12:28,167 --> 01:12:29,226
But we do need

1037
01:12:29,250 --> 01:12:30,518
a leader

1038
01:12:30,542 --> 01:12:32,934
So we organised a class signature campaign

1039
01:12:32,958 --> 01:12:34,809
It's most successful

1040
01:12:34,833 --> 01:12:36,351
To support

1041
01:12:36,375 --> 01:12:37,768
your reinstatement!

1042
01:12:37,792 --> 01:12:38,644
Madam has the original!

1043
01:12:38,668 --> 01:12:40,042
This is the copy!

1044
01:12:49,208 --> 01:12:52,500
We don't want you to go!

1045
01:12:52,833 --> 01:12:54,768
Especially me!

1046
01:12:54,792 --> 01:12:56,518
We've no coach,

1047
01:12:56,542 --> 01:12:57,934
our team morale is low

1048
01:12:57,958 --> 01:12:59,351
We'll lose

1049
01:12:59,375 --> 01:13:01,018
tomorrow's match

1050
01:13:01,042 --> 01:13:03,393
We lose everything without you!

1051
01:13:03,417 --> 01:13:05,375
Are you still mad at us?

1052
01:13:05,625 --> 01:13:07,125
No!

1053
01:13:07,167 --> 01:13:08,976
I'll come to your match tomorrow

1054
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:10,292
Great!

1055
01:13:16,667 --> 01:13:17,875
I'm Sorry!

1056
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:20,958
The girls dated you for me!

1057
01:13:21,458 --> 01:13:22,893
I'm so ashamed!

1058
01:13:22,917 --> 01:13:25,833
My complaints have cost your job!

1059
01:13:26,333 --> 01:13:28,500
| can find a new one!

1060
01:13:28,708 --> 01:13:30,792
But I worry about the girls

1061
01:13:35,917 --> 01:13:37,375
Mr Nosey!

1062
01:13:38,167 --> 01:13:39,667
Piggy!

1063
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:41,833
Piggy!

1064
01:13:42,583 --> 01:13:45,143
Haven't seen him lately?

1065
01:13:45,167 --> 01:13:46,976
He sticks his nose too deep

1066
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:48,750
and got fired!

1067
01:13:54,417 --> 01:13:56,643
He doesn't seemed worried,

1068
01:13:56,667 --> 01:13:58,934
after the girls again!

1069
01:13:58,958 --> 01:14:00,875
Looks real nice!

1070
01:14:02,167 --> 01:14:04,958
But she has no taste

1071
01:14:05,167 --> 01:14:07,434
To choose Mr Nosey

1072
01:14:07,458 --> 01:14:10,375
Any of us can do better!

1073
01:14:11,333 --> 01:14:13,125
You're damn right!

1074
01:14:13,333 --> 01:14:14,917
What're you doing?

1075
01:14:15,125 --> 01:14:17,500
I'll make them disappear

1076
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:24,958
You better go, punk!

1077
01:14:25,292 --> 01:14:26,351
Or else...

1078
01:14:26,375 --> 01:14:27,833
Or else what?

1079
01:14:28,917 --> 01:14:30,292
To take that...

1080
01:14:44,083 --> 01:14:46,393
Same as this, nothing left

1081
01:14:46,417 --> 01:14:49,250
Please go on and have fun, goodbye!

1082
01:15:08,333 --> 01:15:10,417
My tiny waist!

1083
01:15:12,458 --> 01:15:13,833
Does it hurt?

1084
01:15:14,208 --> 01:15:16,667
Yes!

1085
01:15:17,458 --> 01:15:19,625
You need a doctor!

1086
01:15:20,750 --> 01:15:23,125
I'll be alright!

1087
01:15:24,083 --> 01:15:26,125
You need plenty of rest, Mr Hong!

1088
01:15:26,667 --> 01:15:29,333
Don't call me Mr Hong!

1089
01:15:30,917 --> 01:15:32,434
Call me Darling!

1090
01:15:32,458 --> 01:15:33,875
My name is Darling Hong!

1091
01:15:34,792 --> 01:15:36,042
I've got to go!

1092
01:15:36,208 --> 01:15:37,851
Please stay for dinner!

1093
01:15:37,875 --> 01:15:39,917
No, I've a date

1094
01:15:40,708 --> 01:15:41,917
Boy friend?

1095
01:15:43,667 --> 01:15:45,083
There he is!

1096
01:15:52,458 --> 01:15:53,750
Darling!

1097
01:15:55,542 --> 01:15:58,184
| have to go now, bye!

1098
01:15:58,208 --> 01:15:59,102
Don't go!

1099
01:15:59,126 --> 01:16:01,208
No need, bye!

1100
01:16:29,250 --> 01:16:30,583
She's back!

1101
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:33,333
Miss Lo...!

1102
01:16:34,333 --> 01:16:35,667
Madam!

1103
01:16:36,375 --> 01:16:37,185
Please come in!

1104
01:16:37,209 --> 01:16:39,184
The girls want you back!

1105
01:16:39,208 --> 01:16:40,833
But I've...

1106
01:16:41,250 --> 01:16:43,101
| know, I've misjudged you

1107
01:16:43,125 --> 01:16:46,042
Please come back or they'll be disappointed

1108
01:16:46,250 --> 01:16:47,643
Okay

1109
01:16:47,667 --> 01:16:49,768
But on one condition

1110
01:16:49,792 --> 01:16:50,976
What is it?

1111
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,643
Tang gets the canteen again

1112
01:16:52,667 --> 01:16:53,602
No problem!

1113
01:16:53,626 --> 01:16:55,268
Business has been real bad,

1114
01:16:55,292 --> 01:16:57,101
after my deputy took over

1115
01:16:57,125 --> 01:16:58,958
I've considered getting Tang back

1116
01:16:59,542 --> 01:17:00,833
He deserves it

1117
01:17:00,917 --> 01:17:03,101
By the way, the volleyball match this year

1118
01:17:03,125 --> 01:17:04,768
We have a good chance there

1119
01:17:04,792 --> 01:17:07,268
The girls don't feel like it

1120
01:17:07,292 --> 01:17:09,000
and we've lost in the heats!

1121
01:17:09,042 --> 01:17:10,851
Relax

1122
01:17:10,875 --> 01:17:12,125
They'll win the game tomorrow!

1123
01:17:24,708 --> 01:17:28,458
Calling Sam [!

1124
01:17:28,875 --> 01:17:30,250
Please come out!

1125
01:17:33,042 --> 01:17:34,542
Sam (!

1126
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:41,292
Sam |I calling Sam |

1127
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:56,393
What can I do for you?

1128
01:17:56,417 --> 01:17:57,851
It's nice to see you

1129
01:17:57,875 --> 01:17:59,417
Please give me back my power!

1130
01:18:00,583 --> 01:18:02,143
But you said

1131
01:18:02,167 --> 01:18:04,059
you didn't want it

1132
01:18:04,083 --> 01:18:05,726
So you've changed your mind

1133
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:08,143
| don't need it before!

1134
01:18:08,167 --> 01:18:09,833
Because it's troublesome

1135
01:18:10,333 --> 01:18:12,083
But I need it badly now

1136
01:18:12,250 --> 01:18:15,125
Do you want it or not?

1137
01:18:15,458 --> 01:18:17,268
Best if I have it when I need it

1138
01:18:17,292 --> 01:18:18,875
and go when I don't!

1139
01:18:19,625 --> 01:18:21,434
You're asking too much

1140
01:18:21,458 --> 01:18:23,542
God damn it!

1141
01:18:23,917 --> 01:18:25,184
Please!

1142
01:18:25,208 --> 01:18:29,792
Alright, just for old time's sake

1143
01:18:31,167 --> 01:18:33,500
Let's make up two codes!

1144
01:18:34,917 --> 01:18:35,894
What code?

1145
01:18:35,918 --> 01:18:37,333
When I hear "I Love You”

1146
01:18:37,417 --> 01:18:39,375
I'll transmit the power to you

1147
01:18:39,833 --> 01:18:41,125
If not?

1148
01:18:41,708 --> 01:18:43,500
When I hear "Sorry", I'll withdraw!

1149
01:18:44,792 --> 01:18:45,809
| love you!

1150
01:18:45,833 --> 01:18:47,083
Sorry!

1151
01:18:47,333 --> 01:18:50,583
Thanks...!

1152
01:18:56,958 --> 01:18:58,083
| love you!

1153
01:19:02,583 --> 01:19:03,917
Sorry!

1154
01:19:06,458 --> 01:19:08,208
I'm abnormal again!

1155
01:19:12,375 --> 01:19:13,144
He's coming!

1156
01:19:13,168 --> 01:19:14,750
Sir...!

1157
01:19:14,792 --> 01:19:16,018
What took you so long?

1158
01:19:16,042 --> 01:19:17,708
We're in the final!

1159
01:19:18,833 --> 01:19:21,351
You'll win it if you have confidence

1160
01:19:21,375 --> 01:19:24,542
We haven't, look!

1161
01:19:30,542 --> 01:19:33,268
It takes tactics more than just muscle

1162
01:19:33,292 --> 01:19:35,893
Relax, if you really in trouble

1163
01:19:35,917 --> 01:19:37,351
I'll use my power to help

1164
01:19:37,375 --> 01:19:38,601
The Power?

1165
01:19:38,625 --> 01:19:40,851
I'll sneak up on them later

1166
01:19:40,875 --> 01:19:42,917
Go for it, come!

1167
01:19:57,292 --> 01:19:59,726
St Holy is tough

1168
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:07,000
She'll win the cup!

1169
01:20:21,167 --> 01:20:24,708
It's kickout. Great

1170
01:20:32,042 --> 01:20:39,458
Shandong, Shandong is overwhelming

1171
01:20:43,500 --> 01:20:47,125
Cool...

1172
01:20:51,875 --> 01:20:54,625
It doesn't touch net It can be this way

1173
01:21:06,042 --> 01:21:07,250
Idiot

1174
01:21:11,583 --> 01:21:13,042
| love you!

1175
01:21:29,333 --> 01:21:30,625
| love you!

1176
01:22:08,750 --> 01:22:10,601
Is this his "Power"?

1177
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:11,792
It must be!

1178
01:22:17,625 --> 01:22:21,518
Hurry...!

1179
01:22:21,542 --> 01:22:22,917
| love you!

1180
01:22:55,625 --> 01:22:56,477
| love you!

1181
01:22:56,501 --> 01:22:57,583
What?

1182
01:22:58,167 --> 01:22:59,500
Sorry...!

1183
01:23:01,542 --> 01:23:02,667
| love you!

1184
01:23:02,917 --> 01:23:04,143
Me? At my age!

1185
01:23:04,167 --> 01:23:04,977
Sorry...!

1186
01:23:05,001 --> 01:23:06,518
What're you

1187
01:23:06,542 --> 01:23:07,851
trying to do?

1188
01:23:07,875 --> 01:23:08,393
Sorry...!

1189
01:23:08,417 --> 01:23:09,060
I'll show you!

1190
01:23:09,084 --> 01:23:10,667
Sorry!

1191
01:23:18,167 --> 01:23:19,708
Right, Sir...?

1192
01:23:20,750 --> 01:23:23,375
Is OK...

1193
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:25,125
Take easy!

1194
01:23:30,667 --> 01:23:31,875
| love you!

1195
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:33,500
What did you say?

1196
01:23:33,917 --> 01:23:36,000
Sorry, nothing!

1197
01:23:39,083 --> 01:23:40,583
| love you!

1198
01:23:41,083 --> 01:23:43,667
Not in front of the public!

1199
01:23:43,917 --> 01:23:46,375
Sorry...!

1200
01:23:59,542 --> 01:24:01,351
The power is marvellous!

1201
01:24:01,375 --> 01:24:03,333
We'll win this one

1202
01:24:03,875 --> 01:24:08,042
We'll win!

1203
01:24:11,458 --> 01:24:13,208
Sir, we'll win!

1204
01:24:14,250 --> 01:24:14,852
| love you!

1205
01:24:14,876 --> 01:24:16,417
I'm Sorry!

1206
01:24:17,042 --> 01:24:18,476
It's my fault!

1207
01:24:18,500 --> 01:24:19,976
You've taught me a lesson,

1208
01:24:20,000 --> 01:24:21,625
I'm really sorry

1209
01:24:31,583 --> 01:24:33,684
It's no way to treat a colleague

1210
01:24:33,708 --> 01:24:34,833
I'm sorry!

1211
01:24:34,917 --> 01:24:37,184
You can say what you like but not "Sorry"

1212
01:24:37,208 --> 01:24:38,684
No, the Headmistress

1213
01:24:38,708 --> 01:24:39,708
told to say it

1214
01:24:39,833 --> 01:24:42,059
My nephew had been rude to you

1215
01:24:42,083 --> 01:24:43,375
I'm Sorry!

1216
01:24:50,375 --> 01:24:53,851
The power!

1217
01:24:53,875 --> 01:24:54,976
What power?

1218
01:24:55,000 --> 01:24:56,625
How come we don't know?

1219
01:24:58,708 --> 01:25:00,018
Please forgive me!

1220
01:25:00,042 --> 01:25:02,083
Alright, I'll forgive
you, don't come closer

1221
01:25:03,917 --> 01:25:04,727
| love you!

1222
01:25:04,751 --> 01:25:05,809
| don't deserve

1223
01:25:05,833 --> 01:25:07,184
your love

1224
01:25:07,208 --> 01:25:09,083
I'm sorry for what I've done

1225
01:25:09,500 --> 01:25:10,809
God damn it!

1226
01:25:10,833 --> 01:25:11,893
If I provoke you

1227
01:25:11,917 --> 01:25:13,184
I'm sorry!

1228
01:25:13,208 --> 01:25:14,643
Alright... don't say it

1229
01:25:14,667 --> 01:25:17,059
Come and talk to me!

1230
01:25:17,083 --> 01:25:20,167
Sorry...!

1231
01:25:30,708 --> 01:25:32,208
Yes...!

1232
01:26:05,917 --> 01:26:08,143
Thank you, sir!

1233
01:26:08,167 --> 01:26:09,750
| did not use my power!

1234
01:26:11,375 --> 01:26:13,292
You won the game all by yourselves

1235
01:26:13,583 --> 01:26:15,042
Ourselves?

1236
01:26:15,167 --> 01:26:16,102
Us?

1237
01:26:16,126 --> 01:26:17,333
Yes!

1238
01:26:21,792 --> 01:26:23,167
Congratulations!

1239
01:26:43,375 --> 01:26:45,083
Uncle Tang, how are you?

1240
01:26:53,417 --> 01:26:54,500
Madam!

1241
01:26:56,125 --> 01:26:57,583
Welcome back!

1242
01:26:59,875 --> 01:27:01,250
Sam!

1243
01:27:04,167 --> 01:27:07,042
Can you see the difference?

1244
01:27:15,208 --> 01:27:16,500
Attention!

1245
01:27:18,208 --> 01:27:20,833
Good morning, sir!

1246
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:36,375
Good morning, class!

1247
01:27:38,833 --> 01:27:39,976
Starting next week

1248
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:43,000
There'll be tuition daily after school

1249
01:27:43,833 --> 01:27:45,542
Be prepared for your exam

1250
01:27:45,875 --> 01:27:47,518
If the result is good

1251
01:27:47,542 --> 01:27:50,500
I'll take you all to BBQ

1252
01:27:50,542 --> 01:27:52,958
Good...!

1253
01:28:00,917 --> 01:28:02,792
Let's go ashore!

1254
01:28:05,500 --> 01:28:06,809
Sir!

1255
01:28:06,833 --> 01:28:08,184
Swimming is difficult!

1256
01:28:08,208 --> 01:28:09,060
Never mind

1257
01:28:09,084 --> 01:28:10,601
We've got you 3 coaches

1258
01:28:10,625 --> 01:28:11,792
Look!

1259
01:28:14,708 --> 01:28:17,875
We'll not be in the way, goodbye!

1260
01:28:22,875 --> 01:28:25,083
Their good result really is a surprise

1261
01:28:26,167 --> 01:28:27,643
It's to your credit!

1262
01:28:27,667 --> 01:28:29,667
No, they've tried real hard

1263
01:28:29,708 --> 01:28:31,917
I'm taking them to BBQ tomorrow

1264
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:33,476
Hope you will join us!

1265
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:34,625
Yes!

1266
01:28:38,958 --> 01:28:41,250
Look, they've got our table

1267
01:28:42,333 --> 01:28:44,792
Give me one minute, I'll show them

1268
01:28:45,083 --> 01:28:47,083
Remember last time...

1269
01:28:47,208 --> 01:28:49,184
It's different, because of...

1270
01:28:49,208 --> 01:28:50,583
| love you!

1271
01:28:51,917 --> 01:28:54,583
You're sitting in my chair, punk!

1272
01:28:55,667 --> 01:28:56,768
So Mr Nosey is here!

1273
01:28:56,792 --> 01:28:58,500
Let's teach him a lesson!

1274
01:29:31,042 --> 01:29:32,019
How come...?

1275
01:29:32,043 --> 01:29:33,833
I've done my PT lately!

1276
01:29:34,250 --> 01:29:35,542
Please!

1277
01:30:01,292 --> 01:30:04,833
"It's summer holidays
Let's cheer and applaud"

1278
01:30:04,917 --> 01:30:07,292
"Let's sing loud"

1279
01:30:08,417 --> 01:30:13,250
"Let's get wild"

1280
01:30:14,250 --> 01:30:19,208
"I lose my mind I wish
I could fly up to sky”™

1281
01:30:20,083 --> 01:30:22,750
"Like a free bird"

1282
01:30:23,125 --> 01:30:25,208
"Everyday is happy"

1283
01:30:26,583 --> 01:30:31,375
"I'll find my sun in mind for my goal”

1284
01:30:32,625 --> 01:30:37,333
"Even I fail, I'll try
hard to achieve my goal"

1285
01:30:37,750 --> 01:30:40,768
Being an artist,
a writer or a musician is not dream

1286
01:30:40,792 --> 01:30:43,434
But being a philanthropist is dream

1287
01:30:43,458 --> 01:30:48,000
Because a philanthropist
is also a millionaire

1288
01:30:59,500 --> 01:31:02,417
"New stars break out everyday"

1289
01:31:02,500 --> 01:31:04,792
"They shine upon us"

1290
01:31:05,542 --> 01:31:08,292
"We leave school but we
don't know where to go"

1291
01:31:08,542 --> 01:31:10,792
"And we won't stay together anymore"

1292
01:31:11,750 --> 01:31:16,750
"We have to make big"

1293
01:31:17,625 --> 01:31:20,292
"Let's go together"

1294
01:31:20,625 --> 01:31:22,917
"To find out our way"

1295
01:31:24,125 --> 01:31:28,750
"I'll find my sun in mind for my goal”

1296
01:31:30,208 --> 01:31:35,125
"Even I fail, I'll try
hard to achieve my goal"

1297
01:31:35,167 --> 01:31:36,958
It's ideal to be a doctor

1298
01:31:37,042 --> 01:31:37,727
Why?

1299
01:31:37,751 --> 01:31:40,768
There're customers complaint
in every profession

1300
01:31:40,792 --> 01:31:43,226
But when a doctor kills his patient

1301
01:31:43,250 --> 01:31:45,500
Nobody comes back for compensation

1302
01:32:11,042 --> 01:32:13,333
Let's give him a big hand!

1303
01:32:19,292 --> 01:32:21,018
Why don't you dance?

1304
01:32:21,042 --> 01:32:23,167
Invite Miss Lo to the floor!

1305
01:32:23,583 --> 01:32:24,917
Look!

1306
01:32:28,458 --> 01:32:30,851
We've got company!

1307
01:32:30,875 --> 01:32:32,184
Neglect him!

1308
01:32:32,208 --> 01:32:34,292
Come on, ask Miss Lo to dance!

1309
01:32:34,375 --> 01:32:35,934
No, she has a boyfriend!

1310
01:32:35,958 --> 01:32:39,143
Never mind, it's a fair fight!

1311
01:32:39,167 --> 01:32:41,143
Remember the club declaration

1312
01:32:41,167 --> 01:32:42,667
Struggle for your ideal!

1313
01:32:43,000 --> 01:32:44,458
For your future!

1314
01:32:45,583 --> 01:32:49,018
And, for your marriage!

1315
01:32:49,042 --> 01:32:51,934
Yeah, we'll back you up!

1316
01:32:51,958 --> 01:32:55,292
Go...!

1317
01:32:57,042 --> 01:32:58,542
We're dance!

1318
01:33:06,083 --> 01:33:08,976
"In a crowded beach,"

1319
01:33:09,000 --> 01:33:11,583
"tan skin is shining with sweat"

1320
01:33:12,750 --> 01:33:15,726

"Like cold wind is blowing everywhere"

1322
01:33:17,458 --> 01:33:18,792
Sir, go!

1323
01:33:22,292 --> 01:33:24,042
Sir, go!

1324
01:33:26,250 --> 01:33:30,250
"Where is she now?"

1325
01:33:32,750 --> 01:33:38,500
"I won't blame her for taking away the sun"

1326
01:33:39,458 --> 01:33:41,875
"But I will blame her"

1327
01:33:42,292 --> 01:33:45,542
"For taking my heart away"

1328
01:33:46,708 --> 01:33:50,583
"I cry out loud and loud”

1329
01:33:50,625 --> 01:33:53,375
"I hate myself for being heartbreaking"

1330
01:33:54,083 --> 01:33:55,726
"If I know the truth,”

1331
01:33:55,750 --> 01:33:59,309
"I won't be a fool”

1332
01:33:59,333 --> 01:34:00,102
Yeah!

1333
01:34:00,126 --> 01:34:04,059
"I cry out loud and loud”

1334
01:34:04,083 --> 01:34:07,000
"It's all her fault"

1335
01:34:07,500 --> 01:34:11,333
"I choke back my tears"

1336
01:34:11,958 --> 01:34:16,333
"And I wish I could live in pain forever"

1337
01:34:48,792 --> 01:34:51,684
"In a crowded beach,"

1338
01:34:51,708 --> 01:34:54,417
"tan skin is shining with sweat"

1339
01:34:55,500 --> 01:34:58,434

01:35:00,708 --> 01:35:02,684
You're on your own

1342
01:35:02,708 --> 01:35:04,292
But we'll support you

1343
01:35:06,833 --> 01:35:08,333
Sit down!

1344
01:35:08,792 --> 01:35:13,083
"Where is she now?"

1345
01:35:15,542 --> 01:35:21,250
"I won't blame her for taking away the sun"

1346
01:35:22,250 --> 01:35:24,268
"But I will blame her"

1347
01:35:24,292 --> 01:35:25,667
Miss Lo...!

| love you!

1352
01:35:42,125 --> 01:35:44,083
Please don't say it in front of the public!

1353
01:35:44,500 --> 01:35:45,875
I'm blushing!

1354
01:35:46,583 --> 01:35:47,750
Sorry!

1355
01:35:50,208 --> 01:35:53,500
"I choke back my tears"

1356
01:35:54,625 --> 01:35:58,250

01:36:01,583 --> 01:36:03,726
...love...

1358
01:36:03,750 --> 01:36:06,851
I'll wait for you in there!

Help sir!

"Like cold wind is blowing everywhere"

1370
01:36:43,958 --> 01:36:47,018
"Because she vanishes with my warmth"

1371
01:36:47,042 --> 01:36:49,625
"And leaves me alone"

1372
01:36:50,667 --> 01:36:52,601
"Where is she now?"

1373
01:36:52,625 --> 01:36:54,601
I've got something

1374
01:36:54,625 --> 01:36:55,477
| must say

1375
01:36:55,501 --> 01:36:57,934
Maybe you won't like it, it's...

1376
01:36:57,958 --> 01:36:59,333
| love you!

1377
01:37:00,875 --> 01:37:02,792
Please win this one for me!

Are you alright?

1388
01:37:46,458 --> 01:37:49,458
Let's go, what's wrong!

1389
01:37:53,000 --> 01:37:55,583
Damn, I've forgotten my camera!

1390
01:37:55,750 --> 01:37:58,417
You run faster, Mr Hong!

1391
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:01,042
OK...!

1392
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:06,583
Damn, they've done it again!

1393
01:38:07,250 --> 01:38:10,708
Wait for me...!

1394
01:38:10,958 --> 01:38:14,250
Goodbye sir!

1395
01:38:15,375 --> 01:38:18,518
Give me a break, will you?

1396
01:38:18,542 --> 01:38:20,833
Look behind you!

We love you, sir!

1399
01:38:30,625 --> 01:38:32,458
Why you leave me behind?

1400
01:38:33,625 --> 01:38:35,167
Mr Hong!

1401
01:38:40,417 --> 01:38:42,167
Miss Lo!

You're here at last!
