1
00:02:20,897 --> 00:02:21,488
喂！
Hello!

2
00:02:21,631 --> 00:02:23,826
喂，虾头呀，四姨婆呀！
Hello, is it Ha-tau? I'm Auntie!

3
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,761
什么事？
What's the matter?

4
00:02:24,934 --> 00:02:27,402
你还没醒呀，我迟点再打来
Are you still sleeping? I'll call you later

5
00:02:28,005 --> 00:02:29,029
好！
OK!

6
00:02:47,724 --> 00:02:48,418
喂！
Hello!

7
00:02:48,991 --> 00:02:50,356
又是四姨婆呀！
It's you again, Auntie!

8
00:02:50,494 --> 00:02:53,394
你还没起床，那我再迟点打来
You still didn't get up! Then I call you later

9
00:02:53,564 --> 00:02:57,226
不要了，有什么事你说好了
Oh, no need! Just go on!

10
00:02:57,367 --> 00:03:00,301
是这样的，你表妹最近不大舒服
The problem is that your cousin is not feeling well

11
00:03:00,603 --> 00:03:04,130
要出来看医生，为了免她进进出出的
and will go to see doctor! To avoid wasting time in travelling

12
00:03:04,274 --> 00:03:06,469
所以索性叫她在你那里住两天好不好
I'll let her live with you for several day! OK?

13
00:03:08,045 --> 00:03:09,478
原来我还有表妹吗？
Didn't I have a cousin really?

14
00:03:09,812 --> 00:03:12,940
就是你二舅父的女儿阿娥呀！
She's your second uncle's daughter, Ah-ngor!

15
00:03:23,026 --> 00:03:24,323
是谁呢？
Who is it?

16
00:03:36,373 --> 00:03:39,603
我以为你不在家呢，我是阿娥！
I just thought that you were out! I'm Ah-ngor!

17
00:03:40,244 --> 00:03:41,268
你是不是表哥呀？
You are my cousin, aren't you?

18
00:03:41,744 --> 00:03:43,734
当自己家里一样好了
Just treat yourself at home!

19
00:03:43,946 --> 00:03:45,640
厕所、厨房都在那边
There are kitchen and washroom

20
00:03:46,716 --> 00:03:49,913
喂，有人CaII我，叫他迟些打来给我
Hello! Someone's calling me! Tell him to call me later!

21
00:04:05,435 --> 00:04:06,093
喂！
Hello!

22
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,567
喂，麻烦你叫华哥听电话？
Hello! Can I speak to Brother Wah?

23
00:04:08,805 --> 00:04:10,669
他在睡觉，你那位找他？
He's sleeping. Who is calling?

24
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:12,004
连我你都不认识
You don't even know me

25
00:04:12,109 --> 00:04:13,542
那你认识他也不会有多久
You must be his new friend

26
00:04:13,676 --> 00:04:15,007
我叫乌蝇，你是谁呀？
I'm Fly! Who are you?

27
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:16,337
我是他表妹呀！
I am his cousin!

28
00:04:16,513 --> 00:04:18,980
表妹？！随便啦！
Cousin?! Never mind!

29
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:21,379
你告诉他我正在等肥九出来讲数
Tell him that I'm waiting for bargaining with Fat-karl

30
00:04:21,585 --> 00:04:22,551
你叫他醒了就Call我
Tell him to contact me when he get up

31
00:04:22,685 --> 00:04:23,413
好！
OK!

32
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:27,573
喂！
Hello!

33
00:05:27,683 --> 00:05:29,776
喂，表妹呀，华哥还没起床吗？
Hello, Cousin! Didn't Brother Wah get up?

34
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,450
还没有，你是不是有要紧事找他？
Didn't still! Is it urgent?

35
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,578
要不要我去叫醒他？
Didn't you want me to wake him up?

36
00:05:34,957 --> 00:05:36,424
不用了，如果他起来了
No, thanks! If he get up,

37
00:05:36,593 --> 00:05:38,321
你告诉他我还在等肥九来讲数
tell him that I'm still waiting for Fat-karl

38
00:05:38,428 --> 00:05:39,291
叫他CaII我啦！
and tell him to call me!

39
00:05:39,529 --> 00:05:40,324
好的！
OK!

40
00:06:32,682 --> 00:06:34,149
眼困就进房去睡吧！
Go to sleep if you are tired!

41
00:06:34,318 --> 00:06:35,682
我今晚睡客厅行啦
I could sleep in the living room tonight!

42
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,186
为什么戴口罩？
Why do you wear a gauze-mask?

43
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:46,893
费事传染啦！
To avoid infecting other!

44
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:51,598
什么病呀？
What kind of disease?

45
00:06:51,734 --> 00:06:53,429
医生说可能是月市有事
The doctor said that my lung is malfunctioning

46
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,799
所以叫我出来找个专科看看
and tell me to see a specialist

47
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,402
死不了的，不用害怕
You won't die!

48
00:07:02,979 --> 00:07:04,707
多吃些橙就没事啦！
Just eat more oranges and you'll be alright!

49
00:07:09,386 --> 00:07:10,374
怪怪的！
So strange!

50
00:07:19,895 --> 00:07:21,157
刚才有个叫乌蝇的
A guy called Fly had phoned you

51
00:07:21,298 --> 00:07:22,958
打了几次电话来找你
several time a while ago!

52
00:07:26,036 --> 00:07:27,662
是吗？他说什么？
Really? What did he say?

53
00:07:31,308 --> 00:07:31,796
喂！
Hello!

54
00:07:31,941 --> 00:07:32,907
喂，表妹呀？
Hello, little cousin!

55
00:07:33,176 --> 00:07:34,302
华哥起床了没有？
Haven't Brother Wah get up?

56
00:07:35,412 --> 00:07:36,207
喂！
Hello!

57
00:07:36,313 --> 00:07:37,939
我现在还在肥九那儿收数
I'm still staying with Fat-karl for collecting debt

58
00:07:38,248 --> 00:07:40,875
有没搞错，今早收到现在还没收到
Damn it! You still haven't get the money till now?

59
00:07:41,184 --> 00:07:43,516
明明是玩你，你不要走开，我马上来
He's just making fun of you! You stay there and I come at once!

60
00:07:56,599 --> 00:07:57,998
我今晚没空陪你吃饭
I cannot go for dinner

61
00:07:58,135 --> 00:07:59,193
你自己出去吃吧
with you tonight!

62
00:08:02,905 --> 00:08:04,532
这里有一百元，你拿去吃饭
Here's one hundred dollars for your dinner!

63
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,966
钥匙在地毯底下
The key is under the carpet!

64
00:08:08,211 --> 00:08:10,041
除了它吧，很好看吗？！
Take it off, would you? It isn't looking good

65
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:23,592
先喝杯茶吧！
Have a cup of tea first!

66
00:08:28,098 --> 00:08:30,464
肥九，我跟你讲
Fat-karl, I tell you...

67
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:32,661
我乌蝇肯跟你讲这么久
I'm doing you favour to talk with you

68
00:08:32,868 --> 00:08:34,165
算是给足面子你了
for such a long time

69
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:37,236
我乌蝇的名字不够响
I, Fly, am not famous

70
00:08:37,441 --> 00:08:38,907
不是我不够QuaIi
because I'm not qualified

71
00:08:39,276 --> 00:08:41,766
是我大佬教我做人要深藏不露
also my Big Brother always tell me to be subtle

72
00:08:42,245 --> 00:08:43,836
牛池湾飞机你认识吧？！
Did you know Mr Aeroplane of Agah-chee Wan?!

73
00:08:44,014 --> 00:08:45,810
他在我们场里签了一千六百元的单
He had made a debt of $1600

74
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:47,209
不过是拖了两天
and just paid it late for two days,

75
00:08:47,384 --> 00:08:49,579
现在飞不起啦，还要坐轮椅呢！
now he cannot fly, and have to sit on a wheel chair

76
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:53,046
这件事还是我乌蝇亲手做的
I did that with my own hands

77
00:08:54,623 --> 00:08:55,954
你这是抛我啦？！
Are you trying to frighten me?

78
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:59,253
飞机他算是老几呀？拿他来跟我比
He, Aeroplane, is a nobody and cannot be compared to me

79
00:08:59,496 --> 00:09:00,689
我告诉你呀
I tell you...

80
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:01,896
我肥九出来混
I, Fat-karl,

81
00:09:02,065 --> 00:09:03,759
向来没有找数这个习惯
never before have the habit of paying debt

82
00:09:03,966 --> 00:09:07,458
别说是你，大圈那个向东够恶了吧？
Let's say that Big-Circle who were more powerful...

83
00:09:07,636 --> 00:09:08,967
现在也变成细圈啦！
and now Big-Circle becomes Small-Circle!

84
00:09:09,172 --> 00:09:10,832
你知道是为了什么？
Do you know why?

85
00:09:11,007 --> 00:09:12,906
就是因为他拿叠单来叫我找数
It was because he forced me to pay his debt,

86
00:09:13,009 --> 00:09:14,442
被我打得他五官不全
so I hit him nearly into death

87
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:16,407
现在只剩下一只眼啦！
He now get only one eye left!

88
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,940
出来混了才不过两年
Just having two years experience

89
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:20,979
够胆来向我肥九收数？
don't you have the guts to collect my debt?

90
00:09:21,251 --> 00:09:24,913
我肥九的刀疤多过你的脚毛呀！
I got knife-scars more than the number of your leg's hair!

91
00:09:25,322 --> 00:09:28,416
刀疤？我大哥得一条，你有，我切！
Scar? My Big Brother has one! I'll cut myself if you have!

92
00:09:29,092 --> 00:09:30,615
你切啦！
Cut yourself then!

93
00:09:32,262 --> 00:09:33,250
还没讲完？！
Haven't you finish talking?

94
00:09:33,597 --> 00:09:35,257
还在讲开场白
We're in the beginning still!

95
00:09:35,965 --> 00:09:37,829
讲了几个钟头，还只是讲开场白？
Still in the beginning for so many hours!

96
00:09:38,268 --> 00:09:39,097
你找死呀？！
Don't you want to die?

97
00:09:39,236 --> 00:09:41,135
别动，统统不要动！
Don't move! Everybody don't move!

98
00:09:41,304 --> 00:09:43,794
给不给钱？给不给？！
Would you pay the debt?

99
00:09:44,474 --> 00:09:47,806
给，给，我没说不给！
Yes, yes! Why wouldn't I?

100
00:09:50,313 --> 00:09:52,406
想不到会这么顺利的
It's unbelievable! So easy!

101
00:09:52,982 --> 00:09:54,972
看他的样就知道是鳄鱼头，老衬底啦
I know, just by his face, that he is a sheep wearing tiger's skin

102
00:09:55,218 --> 00:09:56,013
有这么多人在
With so many companions,

103
00:09:56,186 --> 00:09:57,777
要有本事的话，早就动你了
they will strike you in the very beginning if they have guts

104
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,647
你说得对！
You are right!

105
00:09:58,754 --> 00:09:59,413
这个给你！
This is for you!

106
00:09:59,556 --> 00:10:00,419
谢谢大佬！
Thank you, Brother!

107
00:10:04,427 --> 00:10:05,085
大佬，你到那里去？
Where are you going Big Brother?

108
00:10:12,402 --> 00:10:13,231
华哥！
Brother Wah!

109
00:10:15,572 --> 00:10:16,333
你来找Mabel？
Visiting Mabel?

110
00:10:16,473 --> 00:10:16,801
是呀！
Yeah!

111
00:10:16,972 --> 00:10:17,960
她还没上班呢！
She hasn't go for work yet!

112
00:10:18,441 --> 00:10:19,202
我到下面去等她
I'll wait for her downstairs

113
00:10:19,276 --> 00:10:19,969
好呀！
OK!

114
00:10:35,325 --> 00:10:36,951
那间Boutique有好多新货到了
That boutique has a lot of new arrival!

115
00:10:37,127 --> 00:10:37,717
是吗？
Really?

116
00:10:37,893 --> 00:10:38,587
改天跟你一起去看吧！
I'll go to the boutique with you some other day!

117
00:10:38,727 --> 00:10:39,591
好呀！
OK!

118
00:10:45,402 --> 00:10:48,234
Mabel!
Mabel!

119
00:10:48,704 --> 00:10:49,728
来！
Come here!

120
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:54,070
我还没吃饭，一齐去宵夜吧！
I didn't have my dinner! Would you go eating with me!

121
00:10:58,114 --> 00:10:59,637
不喜欢就算了
That's OK if you don't like to!

122
00:11:02,818 --> 00:11:05,718
为什么这么晚才返工？
Why did you go to work so lately?

123
00:11:05,888 --> 00:11:06,854
我刚刚才出院
I just left from the hospital

124
00:11:07,957 --> 00:11:11,290
刚刚出院？！又去洗胃？！
Just from the hospital? Why? Stomach-washing again?

125
00:11:11,428 --> 00:11:12,894
不是洗胃，是堕胎呀！
Not stomach-washing! It's abortion!

126
00:11:18,601 --> 00:11:19,693
讲笑是吗？
Are you kidding?

127
00:11:19,835 --> 00:11:21,200
你可以当我讲笑
You can treat it as kidding if you like to!

128
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,675
不是吧，有了也不告诉我？
No it won't! Why didn't you tell me that you were pregnant?

129
00:11:28,211 --> 00:11:29,542
你有给机会我跟你讲吗？
Had you gave me a chance to tell me?

130
00:11:29,745 --> 00:11:31,838
我等了你三天，你有没CaII过我？
I had waited for three day! But didn't you call me?

131
00:11:32,982 --> 00:11:35,814
我没有CaII你，你可以CaII我呀！
You could call me if I didn't!

132
00:11:37,053 --> 00:11:38,883
CaII你，跟你讲什么？
Call you! What could I tell you?

133
00:11:39,022 --> 00:11:40,353
告诉你我要去堕胎
Tell you I'm going for abortion

134
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,456
还是叫你跟我结婚？
or tell you to marry me?

135
00:11:41,591 --> 00:11:44,081
认识了你六年，我得到些什么？
We'd been together for six years! What did I get finally?

136
00:11:44,394 --> 00:11:46,487
人，我有等于没有
I felt like not knowing you

137
00:11:46,629 --> 00:11:48,221
钱，就更加不用说了
and didn't even get any money

138
00:11:48,465 --> 00:11:51,559
我霉得连堕胎的钱都要向老妈借呢！
I'm so poor that I had to borrow my mother's money for abortion!

139
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,666
你说，我到底为了什么？
Speak up! What did I do for?

140
00:11:52,901 --> 00:11:54,129
住口！
Shut up!

141
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,297
你从认识我那天开始
Stop saying! Since the day we'd met,

142
00:11:58,575 --> 00:11:59,734
就知道我是个什么人
you knew already what kind of person I am

143
00:12:02,078 --> 00:12:05,514
你想结婚，想赚钱就不要跟着我
Don't stay with me if you want to marry & want money

144
00:12:06,915 --> 00:12:08,507
你别以为一声不响的去堕了胎
Don't think that because you had abortion so secretly

145
00:12:08,717 --> 00:12:09,911
我就会一世都不安乐
that I would feel sorry for all the rest of my life

146
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:11,348
我不会的！
I won't!

147
00:12:11,521 --> 00:12:13,511
你口里说不会，你的心一定会
Your mouth said you won't but your heart said you will

148
00:12:14,890 --> 00:12:18,417
就因为你不重视我，你不紧张我
Because you didn't bother me, didn't care about me

149
00:12:18,561 --> 00:12:19,959
我就要糟蹋你的孩子
I spoiled your baby

150
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,158
我还要告诉全世界人知道
And I am going to tell everybody

151
00:12:22,365 --> 00:12:23,353
我为了你堕胎
that I had your baby aborted,

152
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,796
等你这一辈子都不安乐
so that you'll feel guilty for the rest of your life

153
00:12:30,373 --> 00:12:33,205
你行，算你行！
You've got the guts!

154
00:13:13,949 --> 00:13:14,846
表哥！
Cousin!

155
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,112
你没事吧？
Are you alright?

156
00:13:44,314 --> 00:13:45,177
表哥！
Cousin!

157
00:13:48,385 --> 00:13:52,081
表哥，有什么事吗？
What's the matter, cousin?

158
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,922
你是不是失恋了？
Are you lovelorned?

159
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,558
你说什么？
What did you say?

160
00:14:06,102 --> 00:14:07,090
你说什么呀？
What did you say?

161
00:14:16,212 --> 00:14:20,410
我告诉你，以后你不要再说这两个字
I tell you! Never talk about lovelorn again

162
00:14:21,284 --> 00:14:22,875
否则的话，我就扔你出去
Or else, I'll throw you out!

163
00:15:37,893 --> 00:15:38,951
你不用去看医生？
Did you see the doctor?

164
00:15:39,928 --> 00:15:41,293
刚刚看完回来
I just returned from the hospital

165
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:44,725
医生怎么说？
What have the doctor said?

166
00:15:45,701 --> 00:15:47,032
明天才有报告
I will get the report tomorrow!

167
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,377
吃过饭没有？我跟你出去吃吧！
Haven't you have your meal? Go eating with me!

168
00:16:01,884 --> 00:16:03,078
我煮了饭啦！
I have make the meal!

169
00:16:14,063 --> 00:16:15,757
今早乌蝇又打过电话来
Fly had phoned you again this morning

170
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:19,193
那衰仔有什么话讲呀？
What had the dirty guy said?

171
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:23,504
没什么，只聊了两句
Nothing special! Just some casual talk!

172
00:16:25,008 --> 00:16:26,373
有没有问我的事呀？
Didn't he ask anything about me?

173
00:16:26,975 --> 00:16:27,770
你什么事？
What kind of thing?

174
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:32,203
昨晚的事呀
The thing happened last night!

175
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:38,510
乌蝇只是问了一句
Fly had asked only once!

176
00:16:40,622 --> 00:16:43,955
问一句？问些什么？
What? What did he ask?

177
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,393
我不敢讲！
I'm afraid to tell you!

178
00:16:48,431 --> 00:16:49,988
有什么话你讲好了
Just tell me what you heard!

179
00:16:50,832 --> 00:16:52,163
真的讲呀？！
Do you insist me to tell you?

180
00:16:54,504 --> 00:16:56,027
他问你是不是失恋了
He asked me if you were lovelorned

181
00:17:09,052 --> 00:17:12,317
整天坐在这里，怎么不出去走走？
You have been here for all day! What didn't you go out?

182
00:17:13,922 --> 00:17:18,120
没什么地方好去，九龙我没有朋友
No place to go! I have no friend in Kowloon

183
00:17:23,266 --> 00:17:26,429
快点吃呀，今晚我同你出去走走
Eat quickly! We'll go out together tonight

184
00:17:38,947 --> 00:17:40,380
表妹，你在读书还是做事？
Cousin, are you studying or working?

185
00:17:41,584 --> 00:17:42,845
在做事啦！
I'm working already!

186
00:17:43,553 --> 00:17:44,577
做什么工作？
What kind of job?

187
00:17:45,488 --> 00:17:47,352
在朋友的餐厅里做帮手
I'm working in a friend's restaurant

188
00:17:48,790 --> 00:17:50,018
男朋友呀？
Boy friend?

189
00:17:53,329 --> 00:17:55,023
不算是男朋友
Well! Not quite!

190
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:56,954
人人都叫他做邓伯
Everybody call him Uncle Tang

191
00:18:00,736 --> 00:18:03,636
等会儿我们去看戏
Let us go to the cinema a while later!

192
00:18:03,739 --> 00:18:06,537
等你有空才说吧，你不一定要陪我的
We'll go if you are free! You have no need to stay with me

193
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:36,001
班救兵呀？！
Calling rescue?

194
00:18:37,939 --> 00:18:39,998
阿西，输了多少钱？
Ah-site, how much have you lose?

195
00:18:40,809 --> 00:18:42,003
五百元！
Five hundreds!

196
00:18:45,048 --> 00:18:47,312
五百元这么少我才不打
I won't play for so little money!

197
00:18:48,384 --> 00:18:52,979
棺材山地一铺过，一千元，怎么样？
One thousand for one game, agree for not?

198
00:18:54,557 --> 00:18:57,081
一千元，波王，怎么看？
One thousand? What's your opinion, King of snooker?

199
00:18:57,793 --> 00:19:00,956
什么？一千元就想看我的实力
What? To see my quality just by one thousand dollar?

200
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:02,529
这盘我用单手让你
I play with single-hand in this game,

201
00:19:02,698 --> 00:19:04,165
有种的就赌两千元
for two thousands

202
00:19:04,534 --> 00:19:07,502
单手让我，即刻签约
Single hand! Let's sign contract at once!

203
00:19:09,738 --> 00:19:10,635
阿西！
Ah-site!

204
00:19:13,409 --> 00:19:14,306
单顶！
Single-head!

205
00:19:30,259 --> 00:19:31,987
又入，怎么看呀？
Another ball into pocket! What's your opinion?

206
00:19:44,107 --> 00:19:46,836
是不是，我说波王厉害嘛！
Right, King of snooker is really great!

207
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:57,150
西呀，看看输了人家几度？
Ah-site, how many scores have I lost?

208
00:20:00,323 --> 00:20:03,383
不用计了，暂时赢你三十度
No need to calculate! He has thirty scores more than you

209
00:20:03,526 --> 00:20:05,551
给你全部入了，都赢你五度
Still has five scores more than you even if you win all the ball rested

210
00:20:06,062 --> 00:20:07,222
怎么看呢？
How do you look?

211
00:20:08,864 --> 00:20:10,694
那就是要SetLOOk架啦！
That means we need a targeting stick!

212
00:20:12,335 --> 00:20:15,030
西呀，拿枝私家Q来
Ah-site, bring me my private cue

213
00:20:27,316 --> 00:20:28,578
开波，开波！
Start, start!

214
00:20:30,419 --> 00:20:32,181
子工西呀！
Stunt Follow

215
00:20:33,156 --> 00:20:34,850
走开呀！
Get away!

216
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,594
走开呀！
Get out of my way!

217
00:20:41,264 --> 00:20:46,292
ScreWBack，现在到SetLOOk架啦
Now, set the targeting stick!

218
00:20:51,474 --> 00:20:54,704
不稳阵，锤稳阵点
Not stable! Make it more stable!

219
00:20:55,811 --> 00:20:59,508
小心点呀，输七度
Beware! You will lost 7 scores!

220
00:20:59,648 --> 00:21:05,450
救波啦，救呀，救呀！
Save that balls! Save it!

221
00:21:05,821 --> 00:21:06,752
你当我死的？！
Are you taking me as a dead!

222
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:09,685
去你的
Fuck off!

223
00:21:11,527 --> 00:21:12,117
大佬！
Big Brother!

224
00:21:13,529 --> 00:21:14,256
怎么啦？大佬！
What's the matter, Big Brother?

225
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:15,159
走啦！
Get away!

226
00:21:40,056 --> 00:21:41,216
走呀，去你的
Go away, bastard!

227
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,754
别走！
Don't go!

228
00:21:44,427 --> 00:21:45,620
别走呀！
Don't go!

229
00:21:53,668 --> 00:21:55,101
你妈的，不要阻着！
Bastard, don't block the way!

230
00:22:00,709 --> 00:22:01,733
死呀你！
Damn you!

231
00:22:16,292 --> 00:22:18,782
死呀，死呀！
Damn it! Damn it!

232
00:22:33,642 --> 00:22:35,166
他妈的
Fuck off

233
00:22:56,299 --> 00:22:59,496
大佬！大佬！
Big Brother!

234
00:23:23,025 --> 00:23:23,956
可以走了吗？
Could we leave now?

235
00:23:26,628 --> 00:23:27,390
好了！
It's OK!

236
00:23:53,122 --> 00:23:54,316
静点好不好？
Be quiet, would you?

237
00:27:09,851 --> 00:27:11,045
你没事吧？
Are you alright?

238
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:12,978
我没事！
I'm alright!

239
00:27:27,702 --> 00:27:29,294
为什么这么晚了还不睡？
Why don't you go to sleep? It's so late

240
00:28:10,745 --> 00:28:13,213
表哥，我的报告出来了
Cousin, my report said that

241
00:28:13,449 --> 00:28:15,075
医生说我没事
my health is alright

242
00:28:15,351 --> 00:28:17,614
我本来想跟你庆祝一下
I want to celebrate with you at first,

243
00:28:17,752 --> 00:28:19,242
不过，四姨婆说这几天
but, Auntie said the weather is fine

244
00:28:19,421 --> 00:28:21,217
天气暖和了，餐厅好忙
& the restaurant is busy these days

245
00:28:21,423 --> 00:28:23,390
邓伯叫我早点回去
Uncle Tang want me to go back earlier

246
00:28:23,658 --> 00:28:26,559
我叫了你两次，不过你都没有反应
I have called you twice, but you have no response

247
00:28:26,761 --> 00:28:28,490
我想你一定很倦了
You must be very tired, I think

248
00:28:28,796 --> 00:28:30,127
热天快到了
Summer is coming

249
00:28:30,366 --> 00:28:32,527
大屿山有很多人进来渡假
& many people will spend their holiday in Lantau Island

250
00:28:32,767 --> 00:28:35,201
不知道你那行有没有假期呢？
Do you have holiday working in such career?

251
00:28:35,937 --> 00:28:38,201
厨房里我煮下了饭
I've made a meal for you in the kitchen

252
00:28:38,673 --> 00:28:40,800
另外我买了几只杯
Besides, I've bought several glasses

253
00:28:41,343 --> 00:28:43,867
我知道，不用多久就全部都会打烂了
I know, they will be all broken sooner or later

254
00:28:44,046 --> 00:28:45,740
所以我藏起了一只
So I've hid one of them

255
00:28:45,913 --> 00:28:47,938
到有一天你需要这只杯的时候
One day when you need this glass,

256
00:28:48,117 --> 00:28:49,175
打个电话给我
give me a phone, and...

257
00:28:49,385 --> 00:28:51,614
我会告诉你藏在什么地方
I'll tell you where it was hidden

258
00:28:51,719 --> 00:28:53,016
拜拜！阿娥！
Goodbye, Ah-ngor!

259
00:29:30,392 --> 00:29:31,518
各位！
Everybody!

260
00:29:34,263 --> 00:29:37,528
小声点呀，小声点呀！
Be quiet! Be quiet!

261
00:29:44,806 --> 00:29:46,899
各位亲友，各位嘉宾
All my relatives and all my guests,

262
00:29:47,242 --> 00:29:50,108
今天就是我弟弟阿西结婚的大好日子
today is the wedding of my brother, Ah-site

263
00:29:50,512 --> 00:29:52,945
酒微菜薄，没什么招呼大家
We've prepared some simple food to serve you

264
00:29:53,082 --> 00:29:55,312
请各位多饮一杯，我先饮为敬！
Would we all raise our glasses I drink first

265
00:29:55,484 --> 00:29:57,815
饮杯！
Cheer!

266
00:29:59,588 --> 00:30:01,782
叫了你礼金不用两百元那么多
I've already said that two hundred dollars were too much

267
00:30:01,956 --> 00:30:02,944
我怎么知道他会在天台摆酒
How would I know he would

268
00:30:03,192 --> 00:30:04,158
那么“缩骨”呢！
hold the ceremony on the roof!

269
00:30:04,792 --> 00:30:05,780
请起筷！
Please eat!

270
00:30:06,495 --> 00:30:08,121
起筷啦，起筷啦！
Use your meal, please!

271
00:30:13,502 --> 00:30:15,799
不要这样，起筷啦！
Don't behave this way! Eat!

272
00:30:16,271 --> 00:30:17,168
看这边！
Look at this way!

273
00:30:18,673 --> 00:30:20,265
多影一张，多影一张
Take one more photograph!

274
00:30:21,276 --> 00:30:22,139
好，好！
OK! OK!

275
00:30:22,277 --> 00:30:23,106
谢谢，谢谢！
Thank you!

276
00:30:23,212 --> 00:30:25,578
快去叫你外父外母出来影相，快点啦
Go bring your mother-in-law and father-in-law to take a photograph!

277
00:30:25,847 --> 00:30:27,109
快点呀！
Hurry up!

278
00:30:33,721 --> 00:30:35,279
阿爸，过去影张相吧！
Father, would you take a photograph!

279
00:30:35,857 --> 00:30:36,788
不影！
No!

280
00:30:36,991 --> 00:30:37,854
影嘛，阿爸！
Take it, father!

281
00:30:37,925 --> 00:30:38,720
不影！
No!

282
00:30:41,163 --> 00:30:44,189
不要这样，去啦，去影嘛！
Don't be like that, go take a photograph!

283
00:30:44,433 --> 00:30:48,027
不影，影鬼影马嘛，影来献世呀！
No! What for? It's really a shame!

284
00:30:49,004 --> 00:30:50,369
要吃你就快点吃
Eat quickly if you want to!

285
00:30:50,472 --> 00:30:52,200
多坐一会儿都会中暑呀！
We must leave soon or else I'll faint

286
00:30:52,374 --> 00:30:54,170
不要这样嘛，老头子！
Don't be like that, father!

287
00:30:54,376 --> 00:30:56,775
没有钱就别学人家摆酒
Don't hold any celebration if you don't have money

288
00:30:56,978 --> 00:30:59,572
在天台摆酒，简直是离谱
Celebrating on the roof is extremely unbelievable

289
00:31:05,853 --> 00:31:07,445
我都不知道要怎样教你
I just don't know how to teach you

290
00:31:07,922 --> 00:31:10,719
你一世人做事有那样是好看的
You have never done a good work in the past

291
00:31:10,992 --> 00:31:13,517
你弟弟，你弟弟结婚
It's your brother's wedding!

292
00:31:13,661 --> 00:31:15,060
你搞得现在这么寒酸？
Why did you made it so shabby?

293
00:31:15,696 --> 00:31:18,187
大哥呀，我不想办得风风光光吗？
Don't you think that I didn't want to make it luxurious?

294
00:31:18,367 --> 00:31:20,528
不过现在没有偏财，你叫我怎么办？
But I have no money! What can I do?

295
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,906
你妈的，这么多说话
Damn it! So noisy!

296
00:31:40,922 --> 00:31:42,389
“屎忽鬼”  ！
Gay fellow!

297
00:31:43,425 --> 00:31:44,618
你说什么？
What did you say?

298
00:31:45,427 --> 00:31:49,123
我说什么？！我说你是“屎忽鬼”呀！
What did I say? I said you are gay!

299
00:31:49,298 --> 00:31:51,357
没有鱼翅你吃吗？没有鲍鱼你吃吗？
I did serve you shark's fin or abalone, didn't you?

300
00:31:52,034 --> 00:31:54,332
就只差些冷气，你这么多说话做什么
It has no air-conditioning! Why are you so talkative?

301
00:31:54,503 --> 00:31:58,302
照我的意思，你只配吃斋鲍鱼
You only deserved vegetal abalone

302
00:31:58,574 --> 00:32:00,131
要不是你女婿说你喜欢吃鲍鱼
If your son-in-law didn't say you love eating abalone,

303
00:32:00,275 --> 00:32:01,367
我会给你吃？！
I won't let you have it!

304
00:32:01,642 --> 00:32:03,701
早知道你这么老土
If I know you are so troublesome,

305
00:32:03,978 --> 00:32:06,605
吃鲍鱼，去吃屎啦你！
I'll give you shit, not abalone!

306
00:32:07,416 --> 00:32:08,643
你这小子想找死是吗？
Are you looking for death?

307
00:32:08,816 --> 00:32:09,942
用东西扔我？！
Don't you dare throwing things to me?

308
00:32:10,085 --> 00:32:11,915
你不要阻着我，让我打死他
Don't block my way! Let me kill him

309
00:32:12,087 --> 00:32:13,075
是不是想打架呀？
Don't you want to fight?

310
00:32:13,255 --> 00:32:14,778
大哥，不要这样呀，大哥！
Don't do that, Big Brother!

311
00:32:15,023 --> 00:32:16,853
想比划一下是吗？
Want to fight, don't you?

312
00:32:17,025 --> 00:32:19,323
喂，你现在想怎么样？走开呀！
Hey, now what do you want? Get away!

313
00:32:20,195 --> 00:32:22,185
我告诉你，你不要出声呀！
I tell you, don't make any noise!

314
00:32:22,531 --> 00:32:22,894
为什么不出声？
What can't I speak?

315
00:32:23,031 --> 00:32:23,463
坐下！
Sit down!

316
00:32:24,099 --> 00:32:25,123
走开呀！
Get lost!

317
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:25,731
好小子！
Good boy!

318
00:32:25,900 --> 00:32:27,662
坐下，坐下呀！
Sit, sit down!

319
00:32:28,403 --> 00:32:31,894
怎么？不对呀，他是屎忽鬼嘛！
Hey! Is it right? He's really bastard

320
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:33,302
你是不是要在大哥面前动手？
Do you really want to fight before Big Brother?

321
00:32:33,442 --> 00:32:34,305
是不是呀？
Don't you?

322
00:32:34,543 --> 00:32:37,170
你讲呀，你讲多一次
Speak up! Speak once more!

323
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,608
他怎么样都是阿西的外父
Anyway, he is Ah-site's father-in-law

324
00:32:44,186 --> 00:32:46,881
你这样搞法，即是令你弟弟难做？
If you make trouble, your young brother will be embarrassed

325
00:32:47,122 --> 00:32:47,746
你说对不对？
Do you agree?

326
00:32:47,955 --> 00:32:52,415
好，好，我不对，我错，是我不对！
OK! It's my fault! I'm wrong!

327
00:32:58,599 --> 00:33:04,538
弟弟，今天大哥要你受委屈
My young brother, I make you suffered today

328
00:33:05,873 --> 00:33:11,640
将来大哥赚到了钱，一定替你补数
I'll pay for it when I have money some days

329
00:33:25,726 --> 00:33:28,058
早已知道轮到我们社团的了
I knew that it's our turn

330
00:33:28,196 --> 00:33:29,753
估不到那么快的
But it happens so soon

331
00:33:29,997 --> 00:33:32,090
昨晚警察拘捕了我们二十多人
The cops arrested us last night.

332
00:33:32,301 --> 00:33:34,462
拘捕了那些卒子不紧要
They're just small fry, It's not a big deal

333
00:33:34,602 --> 00:33:36,797
大口基是揸数的
Big-mouth kay controls the money

334
00:33:44,946 --> 00:33:46,311
听里面的人说
They said that

335
00:33:46,481 --> 00:33:51,144
警察正和他谈判，想转他做污点证人
The cops are making a deal with him. They wont him to be turncoat witness

336
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,252
这件事可大可小呀！
This case is quite serious!

337
00:33:54,456 --> 00:33:56,719
所以“阿公”叫我来通知你们
So that Godfather sent me to inform you that,

338
00:33:56,891 --> 00:34:00,327
这阵子没什么事就不要搞那么多事
don't make any trouble if it is not necessarily these days

339
00:34:02,863 --> 00:34:04,853
喂，外面哈林大行动呀！
Hey, the police has a great action outside!

340
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:05,591
你们这班仆街
All of you bastards

341
00:34:05,766 --> 00:34:07,028
那个身上有毒品、家生呀！
who have drugs and weapons,

342
00:34:07,302 --> 00:34:09,269
快点自己搞定
go hide them away quickly!

343
00:34:11,106 --> 00:34:13,096
华仔，外面有人找你呀！
Ah-wah, someone visiting you outside!

344
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:14,136
谢谢！
Thank you!

345
00:34:20,815 --> 00:34:21,712
你来做什么？
What are you coming for?

346
00:34:21,882 --> 00:34:22,940
专诚来找你的
I visit you with special reason

347
00:34:23,185 --> 00:34:25,244
你弟弟乌蝇在我们这里欠了条数
Your brother, Fly, owe us a sum of money

348
00:34:25,454 --> 00:34:28,582
几期没还，CaII他，他又不覆机
He hasn't pay the debt for several period and didn't reply our call

349
00:34:29,291 --> 00:34:31,350
我大哥叫我来知会你一声
My big brother sent me to inform you that...

350
00:34:31,659 --> 00:34:33,626
如果明天还不见他露面的话
If he don't show up tomorrow,

351
00:34:33,794 --> 00:34:35,591
就算自己人也没情面给了
we won't give him any chance

352
00:34:36,731 --> 00:34:40,632
你回去告诉TOny，教弟弟我自己会教
Tell Tony that I know how to teach my own man,

353
00:34:40,901 --> 00:34:43,131
至于这笔数，我会问乌蝇的
and, about the debt, I will ask Fly

354
00:34:43,305 --> 00:34:44,066
如果是真的
If it's true,

355
00:34:44,206 --> 00:34:45,832
我明天带他上竹馆去找他
I will bring him to see Tony tomorrow

356
00:34:55,883 --> 00:34:58,010
大哥，找我吗？
Do you want to see me?

357
00:35:03,891 --> 00:35:05,381
你最近很需要钱用吗？
You need money don't you?

358
00:35:07,162 --> 00:35:10,824
什么最近呀，我什么时候也需要钱用
I always need money

359
00:35:11,366 --> 00:35:16,962
不过也惯了，我乌蝇看得很远大的
I'm used to it. I have big prospects

360
00:35:17,838 --> 00:35:20,806
相士说我三十岁行鼻运
The fortune teller told me I'll be freat at the age of 30

361
00:35:21,109 --> 00:35:25,443
到时便一帆风顺，扶摇直上
Every thing is finethen

362
00:35:25,613 --> 00:35:27,376
那还需要在这里过活
No need to stay here

363
00:35:29,351 --> 00:35:33,047
相士有没有说你等不到三十岁
Did he told you that you can't live to 30

364
00:35:33,188 --> 00:35:34,677
没有呀！
No!

365
00:35:35,323 --> 00:35:38,155
我现在收到消息，说你借了TOny钱
I heard that you borrowed money from Tony

366
00:35:38,326 --> 00:35:39,189
Who is Tony?
Who is Tony?

367
00:35:39,394 --> 00:35:40,621
I don't know him.
I don't know him.

368
00:35:42,297 --> 00:35:43,763
你在说什么呀？
What did you say?

369
00:35:44,232 --> 00:35:45,529
英文罗！
English

370
00:35:45,633 --> 00:35:48,101
你明知我不懂英文你和我说英文
You knew that I don't know English

371
00:35:49,504 --> 00:35:52,666
我问你，你是不是在TOny里借了钱
I ask you. Did you borrow money from Tony?

372
00:35:52,840 --> 00:35:54,034
没有呀！
No!

373
00:35:55,343 --> 00:35:58,072
没有？为什么他们那么紧张到处找你
No? Why are they looking for you?

374
00:35:58,313 --> 00:36:00,075
现在他们在对面宵夜
They are eating around the corner

375
00:36:00,315 --> 00:36:01,509
要不要caII他们过来？
Do you want me to tell them you're here?

376
00:36:01,682 --> 00:36:02,670
好呀！
Yes!

377
00:36:09,591 --> 00:36:11,080
眨什么眼呀
Who are you winking to?

378
00:36:12,427 --> 00:36:16,328
到底问人借了多少？多少呀？
How much did you borrow?

379
00:36:17,499 --> 00:36:19,558
少数目吧，不用那么紧张
Just a small sum. Take it easy

380
00:36:19,734 --> 00:36:21,133
少数不是数吗？
Small sum is also money

381
00:36:21,369 --> 00:36:22,495
多少呀？
How much?

382
00:36:23,004 --> 00:36:26,235
一千几百吧，小儿科啦，不用理他
Hundreds bucks. It's not a big deal, leave him alone

383
00:36:26,607 --> 00:36:29,075
一千几百他们那么紧张来找我
But they come to me

384
00:36:31,213 --> 00:36:32,510
你说不说
Tell me

385
00:36:37,785 --> 00:36:41,585
四围到会，一对龙凤厄，你自己计吧
4 meals and a pair of gold bracelets

386
00:36:58,073 --> 00:36:59,039
这里是八千！
Here are eight thousands!

387
00:37:02,977 --> 00:37:08,347
什么？八千？！你这钱一张当两张用呀
What? Eight thousands? Are you using one dollar as two?

388
00:37:10,718 --> 00:37:12,379
他说就这么多
It's so if he said it is!

389
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:16,490
大数是八千，还有尾数呢？
The principal is eight thousands! What about the rest?

390
00:37:16,957 --> 00:37:19,255
他呀，四期没供
He haven't paid for four instalments

391
00:37:20,262 --> 00:37:23,425
零头不计，就收他一万三千五
Omitting the odd, he still owe us thirteen thousand and five

392
00:37:23,598 --> 00:37:24,723
当自己人才这样收顺的啦
We are giving you benefit because we know you

393
00:37:24,832 --> 00:37:25,856
你去抢吧！
Why don't you go robbing?

394
00:37:30,105 --> 00:37:32,335
你是什么辈份，跟我讲话？
Who do you think you are? Speak to me?

395
00:37:32,474 --> 00:37:33,701
这么喜欢讲话
So fond of talking

396
00:37:33,841 --> 00:37:36,366
光仔，陪他走过一边去讲足三个钟头
Ah-kwong, talk to him for several hours at there!

397
00:37:36,511 --> 00:37:36,839
是！
Yes!

398
00:37:37,012 --> 00:37:37,739
讲你老母！
Fuck off, you son of bitch!

399
00:37:37,912 --> 00:37:40,744
收声，你同我出去！
Shut up! Get out!

400
00:37:42,950 --> 00:37:43,974
出去呀！
Get out!

401
00:37:55,463 --> 00:37:58,158
你这个细佬好命，跟着你
Your brother is lucky in working under you

402
00:37:59,067 --> 00:38:00,931
如果跟第二瓣，怕死了很久啦！
If he is working for other, he have already died!

403
00:38:02,070 --> 00:38:06,439
不要多讲了，我不跟你计这些婆母数
Don't talk anymore I don't want to talk about that

404
00:38:10,312 --> 00:38:11,744
本呢你就先收回
I return you the principal first

405
00:38:12,013 --> 00:38:14,606
至于息呢，他现在真的没有
But he really didn't have money to paid the interest

406
00:38:14,748 --> 00:38:15,679
拖多你两期了
So we have to delay for two instalments more

407
00:38:16,617 --> 00:38:17,709
又要拖多两期？
Two instalments delay?

408
00:38:17,852 --> 00:38:20,013
不是要拖到我死了才烧回给我吧？
Why not return to me after my death?

409
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:22,988
你不信他，信我呀！
You must trust me even if you don't trust him!

410
00:38:23,091 --> 00:38:24,524
现在我背上了这条数
I'll responsible for this debt

411
00:38:26,261 --> 00:38:27,592
我现在身上没钱
But I have no money now

412
00:38:27,928 --> 00:38:29,895
过两天我亲自拿来给你
I'll give you after two days

413
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,732
一万八千都没有，你怎么做人大佬呀
How can you be a Big Brother if you don't have any money at hand

414
00:38:35,903 --> 00:38:37,598
不如回乡下耕田啦
I think you better go farming!

415
00:38:37,872 --> 00:38:41,467
我以为你有钱才坐在这里同你谈谈
I thought that you had money so I dared to talk with you

416
00:38:41,942 --> 00:38:44,876
做大佬做得像你这么霉…
You are such a poor Big Brother...

417
00:38:51,286 --> 00:38:54,254
是不是真的要呢？
Did you really want it?

418
00:38:55,856 --> 00:38:56,948
怎么？
What's the matter?

419
00:38:57,225 --> 00:38:58,885
什么？你都丧的
What? You are crazy!

420
00:38:59,627 --> 00:39:01,652
你给得出，我收得起呀，细佬！
I have the gut to take it if you have it now

421
00:39:05,066 --> 00:39:06,556
好，我先打个电话
OK! I dial a phone first

422
00:39:17,379 --> 00:39:19,039
你呀，还在这里做什么？
Why are you standing here still?

423
00:39:19,547 --> 00:39:21,878
你大佬叫你同我讲话，怎么你不讲呀
Your boss told you to talk with me, why didn't you speak?

424
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:22,845
你老爸叫什么名？
What's your father name?

425
00:39:23,018 --> 00:39:23,881
你老妈叫什么名呀？
What's your mother called?

426
00:39:24,019 --> 00:39:25,043
不要玩了，乌蝇！
Stop joking, Fly!

427
00:39:25,853 --> 00:39:26,877
为什么不讲呀？
Why didn't you speak?

428
00:39:27,022 --> 00:39:28,250
你没有爸爸妈妈的吗？
You don't have parents?

429
00:39:35,397 --> 00:39:36,455
你是不是老板呀？
Aren't you the boss?

430
00:39:39,934 --> 00:39:40,900
不要过来呀
Don't come near to me

431
00:39:42,003 --> 00:39:44,028
我现在有困难，想问你借点钱？
I have some problem now, can you lend me some money?

432
00:39:44,172 --> 00:39:44,865
行不行？
Could you?

433
00:39:45,273 --> 00:39:45,897
行！行！
Yes, I could!

434
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:46,530
行是吗？
Really?

435
00:39:46,674 --> 00:39:47,538
行！行！
Really! No problem!

436
00:39:47,675 --> 00:39:48,437
乌蝇！
Fly!

437
00:39:51,612 --> 00:39:53,739
今天这些钱是我问你老板借的
Now I borrow these money from your boss

438
00:39:54,049 --> 00:39:55,640
要不要就随便你
It's up to you, take it or not!

439
00:39:55,916 --> 00:39:58,146
不过，我同你就没拖没欠了
But, there's no debt between us from now on

440
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:00,712
我告诉你，将来如果我有好景
I tell you, if I become rich in the future

441
00:40:00,888 --> 00:40:02,378
我一定会还给你的
I will paid back to you

442
00:40:02,557 --> 00:40:03,284
今日你帮着外人
Today, you are wrong in helping outsider

443
00:40:03,491 --> 00:40:04,821
来对付自己人就是你不对
to beat your own people

444
00:40:04,992 --> 00:40:05,958
是不是？
Is it right?

445
00:40:07,062 --> 00:40:09,087
还不快拿钱去还给TOny？！
What are you waiting for? Take the money to Tony!

446
00:40:09,264 --> 00:40:10,195
算无数！
Cancel each other!

447
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,467
这个，是醒你的
This is given you as bonus!

448
00:40:22,043 --> 00:40:25,103
你真行，在我的场里玩花样
You are really something! Playing trick in my place

449
00:40:27,648 --> 00:40:29,878
你更行呢，玩我呢
You are also great! You've make fun of me!

450
00:40:30,352 --> 00:40:31,784
阻多你一阵
Wait a moment

451
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:33,683
走呀！
Get away!

452
00:40:43,231 --> 00:40:46,666
TOny，我是叫你来看场
Tony, I'm employing you to guard this place,

453
00:40:46,834 --> 00:40:49,598
不是叫你找人来打劫我
instead of inviting robber to rob me

454
00:40:49,737 --> 00:40:51,261
你现在算什么意思？
What do you mean by that?

455
00:40:51,473 --> 00:40:53,804
老板，他是一时冲动
Boss, he is just losing temper!

456
00:41:10,325 --> 00:41:12,053
现在风头火势
The situation is bad now,

457
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:14,450
你两个还在狗咬狗骨的
but you two still fighting each other

458
00:41:14,661 --> 00:41:16,322
这是当我死的？！
Are you treating me as a dead?

459
00:41:17,298 --> 00:41:22,132
是他不对在先，欠我的钱不还
It's him who done wrong first Borrowed my money

460
00:41:22,270 --> 00:41:24,897
又来我的场找麻烦，还打劫我的老板
causing trouble in my place, and robbing my boss

461
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:28,431
话到尾都讲不通啦，阿公！
He was wrong in the whole situation, Godfather!

462
00:41:28,876 --> 00:41:31,936
你明知道他丧，就不要去动他
You know he is crazy already, so don't bother him

463
00:41:32,946 --> 00:41:36,143
你也是太离谱了点，这样过兄弟一同戈
And you are doing too much, taking advantage from him

464
00:41:37,785 --> 00:41:40,117
你明知那个场是他看的嘛
You must know that he was guarding that place!

465
00:41:41,156 --> 00:41:44,353
阿公，我都是下爬呀
Godfather, I'm giving back!

466
00:41:44,792 --> 00:41:47,090
如果要还钱的，不是还给他罗
He want the money back, so I paid the debt

467
00:41:47,228 --> 00:41:48,490
我们无数了
We've made an equal exchange!

468
00:41:48,762 --> 00:41:49,693
无数？！
Equal?

469
00:41:50,498 --> 00:41:51,657
你们俩做什么？
What are you doing?

470
00:41:52,033 --> 00:41:54,263
有我在一日就由我揸主意
I'm the one who make decision till I die

471
00:41:54,835 --> 00:41:55,698
这么多事！
So troublesome!

472
00:41:55,803 --> 00:41:58,771
我现在告诉你们，你每个月供还给他
Now I tell you two, you paid the instalments every month

473
00:41:58,939 --> 00:42:01,965
这件事就这样算数，揸爬啦！
And the event is settled in this way Make a vow!

474
00:42:05,813 --> 00:42:08,679
你们两个还做什么？我叫你们妥就妥
What are you two doing? I told you two to make agreement!

475
00:42:08,849 --> 00:42:12,046
还不揸？！揸！
Have a hand-shake? Shake

476
00:42:17,925 --> 00:42:20,688
阿基那个反骨仔现在做了污点证人
Ah-kay, the traitor, is a witness for the police

477
00:42:21,396 --> 00:42:23,329
这个人不可以留着
We cannot let this guy survived

478
00:42:23,864 --> 00:42:26,128
在没上庭之前杀了他
Kill him before he go to court

479
00:42:26,334 --> 00:42:27,630
你们俩怎么看呢？
What's your opinion?

480
00:42:28,702 --> 00:42:31,636
难道这么高，叫那个呢？
The task is difficult! Which one should we send?

481
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:34,664
这件事我不想找外人做
I don't want outsider to take this case

482
00:42:34,875 --> 00:42:35,933
不如这样
Let's make it this way

483
00:42:36,111 --> 00:42:38,908
你们俩找几个醒目点的靓仔
You two, find some smart boys

484
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,179
过两天执生死筹
to draw dead lots two days later

485
00:42:42,916 --> 00:42:47,648
就他好了，又够胆，又够串
He's the one, brave, and haughty

486
00:42:47,988 --> 00:42:49,955
叫你细佬呀，他肯做的话
Send your younger brother if he wish to do it

487
00:42:50,191 --> 00:42:52,750
我就蚀底点，他欠我的钱不用还
I'll let him go! I'll let him not paying my debt

488
00:42:52,893 --> 00:42:54,292
衰了还有安家费
His family can have subsidize if he fail

489
00:42:54,661 --> 00:42:55,787
够不够姜先？！
Do you have the guts?

490
00:42:55,896 --> 00:42:58,194
什么？你说什么？大我呀？！
What? What did you say? Frightening me?

491
00:42:58,732 --> 00:42:59,824
收声！
Shut up!

492
00:43:01,768 --> 00:43:03,065
不要玩那些兄弟
Don't making fun of the followers

493
00:43:03,238 --> 00:43:05,603
这里最姜的就是你同我
You and me are the bravest

494
00:43:06,174 --> 00:43:08,335
这件事不是你就是我了
It's either you or me to take this case

495
00:43:08,642 --> 00:43:12,703
你不做就我做，你开声就无所谓了
I'll do it if you don't, say it and I'll take it!

496
00:43:14,748 --> 00:43:18,013
不出声就当你做了
You'll do if you don't speak up

497
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:22,517
你肯认衰仔讲声不做，就我好了
Say you don't and admit that you are a coward. And I'll take the case

498
00:43:23,024 --> 00:43:24,355
省省吧！
Wake up!

499
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,350
现在你两兄弟是夹埋来屈我了？！
Now you two are pushing me together?

500
00:43:27,529 --> 00:43:29,655
好啦，我劈完你们俩再去劈他
OK! I kill you two first and then I'll kill him

501
00:43:30,265 --> 00:43:32,290
又来啦，别吵！
Not again! Stop quarrelling!

502
00:43:32,799 --> 00:43:34,732
这件事怎样做我自然有分数
I have my plan in handling this case

503
00:43:34,868 --> 00:43:35,994
你们先出去！
All of you go out first

504
00:43:36,637 --> 00:43:38,604
走了，阿公！
I leave now, Godfather!

505
00:43:39,073 --> 00:43:40,267
走了，阿公！
I leave now, Godfather!

506
00:43:40,774 --> 00:43:42,298
华仔，回来！
Ah-wah, come back!

507
00:43:45,513 --> 00:43:48,913
我知道你同你条“靓”好好感情
I know that you and your brother are good friends

508
00:43:49,217 --> 00:43:52,845
但是他做事太癫啦，多教教他
But he is too crazy. Teach him...

509
00:43:53,021 --> 00:43:55,046
否则就等于放个计时炸弹在身边
or he will like a time-bomb beside you

510
00:43:55,256 --> 00:43:56,654
迟早会害死你的
and some day he will cause you deadly trouble

511
00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:00,652
我知道，我也想过了
I know, I have think of it

512
00:44:00,861 --> 00:44:03,022
我想找个正行他做
I want to find him a job

513
00:44:03,331 --> 00:44:04,126
这就好啦！
It's good to do it!

514
00:44:04,665 --> 00:44:07,759
鱼旦，鱼…

515
00:44:11,139 --> 00:44:12,935
今天完了，收工
That's all for today

516
00:44:14,209 --> 00:44:15,698

522
00:44:38,566 --> 00:44:41,125
做那一个几毫生意也不行吗？
Do you mean I can't do small business?

523
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:43,966
我是什么人呀
Do you know who I am?

524
00:44:45,739 --> 00:44:50,698
是罗，慢慢做，迟些越做越发的
You'll develop into big business

525
00:44:50,844 --> 00:44:53,540
是呀，今天我在这里卖鱼旦
Yeah, I sell fishballs here today

526
00:44:54,315 --> 00:44:56,282
迟些我在中东卖飞弹
Someday I'll sell bounbs in Middle East

527
00:44:56,451 --> 00:44:58,384

喂鱼旦佬，架车是不是你的？
Does this cart belong to you. Fishball man

532
00:45:09,696 --> 00:45:11,527
你叫谁呀    鱼旦佬罗
What's your name? Fishball man

533
00:45:11,732 --> 00:45:12,629
什么鱼旦佬呀？

534
00:45:12,766 --> 00:45:13,494
不是卖鱼旦
If you don't sell fishballs

535
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:15,224
拿着剪刀企在这里做什么呀？
You stand here with scissors?

539
00:45:22,776 --> 00:45:25,301
搬走吧，无眼看

00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:27,573
喂！你算怎样呀
Hey! What are you doing?

541
00:45:27,748 --> 00:45:28,942
架车仔和鱼旦不用钱买的吗？
The cart and the fishballs are bought by money

542
00:45:29,117 --> 00:45:30,640
钱是小，面子是大
Money doesn't matter. But pride matters

543
00:45:30,817 --> 00:45:33,581
我乌蝇的名字虽然不出名，但有人知
I'm not famous. But people know me

544
00:45:33,754 --> 00:45:35,551
叫我推着架鱼旦车到处走
I don't want to sell fishballs

545
00:45:35,756 --> 00:45:36,848
我还用出来行吗？
I Want to hang around

546
00:45:39,626 --> 00:45:42,754
走开，买了间戏院呀，走开
Get lost, get away

547
00:45:43,997 --> 00:45:46,295
现在叫你去干活，跟出来行没有关系
I want you to have a job

548
00:45:46,633 --> 00:45:47,998
我不喜欢卖鱼旦呀
I don't like selling fishballs

549
00:45:48,236 --> 00:45:49,930
你不卖鱼旦，你喜欢卖什么呀？
What do you like to sell?

550
00:45:50,238 --> 00:45:51,296
文又不行，武也不行
You can't do anything

551
00:45:51,439 --> 00:45:52,735
整天紧着出来行
Just hang around

552
00:45:53,041 --> 00:45:54,599
说了你不是这种材料啦
You are not anything

553
00:45:54,741 --> 00:45:56,504
是，我不是这种材料
Yeah, I'm not anything

554
00:45:56,677 --> 00:45:58,008
我最适合去卖鱼旦
I can only sell fishballs

555
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:01,179
好，你叫我卖我便去卖罗
You ask me to do that

556
00:46:01,882 --> 00:46:03,008
卖到有一天我受不了
If I can't stand anymore

557
00:46:03,184 --> 00:46:05,083
我放些山埃落去毒死他们吧
I'll put poison on the fishballs

558
00:46:08,955 --> 00:46:10,354
为你好吧，你知不知呀？
It's good for you. Do you understand?

559
00:46:28,309 --> 00:46:32,473
Hi，这么巧呀？
Hi, what a coincident!

560
00:46:32,713 --> 00:46:34,146
对呀，真巧！
Right! Really a coincident!

561
00:46:37,784 --> 00:46:38,750
你好吗？
How are you?

562
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:48,259
好！…我结婚了
Fine! I have married!

563
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:59,562
好事，你老公对你怎么样？
Good! Are your husband treating you good?

564
00:47:00,441 --> 00:47:01,600
不错！
Quite good!

565
00:47:07,181 --> 00:47:09,342
这么大的雨，也不知要等到什么时候
So heavy is the rain! Who knows hot long will I have to wait!

566
00:47:10,184 --> 00:47:12,151
我在等我老公来接我
I'm waiting for my husband!

567
00:47:15,223 --> 00:47:16,485
抽不抽烟呀？
Have a cigarette?

568
00:47:16,957 --> 00:47:18,219
我戒了！
I didn't smoke anymore!

569
00:47:31,838 --> 00:47:33,203
不是你的
It's not yours

570
00:47:37,644 --> 00:47:38,576
我走了！
I leave now!

571
00:47:47,121 --> 00:47:47,984
拜拜！
Goodbye!

572
00:47:58,299 --> 00:47:59,561
阿娥在吗？
Is Ah-ngor here?

573
00:47:59,733 --> 00:48:01,758
她不在，是谁找她呀？
She is not here. Who are you?

574
00:48:03,571 --> 00:48:05,596
不用了，谢谢！
It's alright. Thanks

575
00:49:40,468 --> 00:49:41,126
小姐！
Lady!

576
00:49:41,502 --> 00:49:42,399
什么事？
What's the matter?

577
00:49:42,602 --> 00:49:43,626
阿娥在吗？
Is Ah-ngor here?

578
00:49:43,837 --> 00:49:46,237
不清楚，她好像去了九龙还没回来
I'm not sure! She had went to Kowloon and still haven't returned

579
00:49:47,341 --> 00:49:47,704
去了九龙？！
To Kowloon?

580
00:49:47,741 --> 00:49:48,672
是呀！
Yes!

581
00:49:51,412 --> 00:49:52,139

你好像肥了些！
You look a bit fatter than before

586
00:50:59,679 --> 00:51:00,703
少少！
A little bit

587

全靠他，他是我的医生
It's all because of him He's my doctor

00:51:13,194 --> 00:51:14,593
你今晚在这里过夜？！
Would you stay up here tonight?

590
00:51:15,829 --> 00:51:18,992
不…我现在要回去了
No... I'm going home now

591
00:51:27,741 --> 00:51:28,469
阿娥
Ah-ngor!

592
00:51:31,878 --> 00:51:36,110
我想告诉你，我找到那只杯啦！
I just wanted to you tell that I've found that glass

593
00:52:33,606 --> 00:52:34,573
张小姐CaII你
Miss Cheung called you just now

594
00:52:34,741 --> 00:52:36,038
她说她现在正赶去梅窝码头
She said that she was going to the pier of Silver-mine Bay

595
00:52:36,243 --> 00:52:37,766
叫你无论如何都要等她
and told you to wait for her anyway

596
00:54:42,802 --> 00:54:43,962
你可以先上去睡觉
You may go to sleep

597
00:54:44,138 --> 00:54:45,627
明天我再帮你Checkin

明早几点返工？

Would you not go home tonight?

608
00:55:56,510 --> 00:55:58,033
为什么到现在才来找我？
Why do you not visit me until now?

609
00:56:02,615 --> 00:56:04,549
因为我自己知道自己的事
Because, I know myself clearly

610
00:56:06,086 --> 00:56:07,814
我不可以答应你些什么
I cannot promise you anything

611
00:56:11,191 --> 00:56:17,823
如果我不是挂着你，我不会进来找你
If I'm not missing you, I won't visit you today

612
00:56:20,367 --> 00:56:22,392
如果你再不来找我
If you don't visit me in these days

613
00:56:22,735 --> 00:56:24,566
我可能同那个医生结婚
I will probably marry that doctor

614
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:32,700
鱼蛋佬，我要一元，要多点酱
Fish-ball guy, give me one dollar of fish-ball with more dressing

615
00:57:40,280 --> 00:57:44,512
摆呀，怎么不摆？多点酱嘛
Take it, why don't you take it? You've said you want more dressing!

616
00:57:44,884 --> 00:57:48,012
摆呀，不摆我会庆的
Take it or I'll get mad

617
00:57:51,791 --> 00:57:54,885
鱼蛋佬？！你妈的！
Fish-ball guy? Damn you!

618
00:57:56,497 --> 00:58:00,694
不是吧，乌蝇哥，怎么霉成这样？
It won't, Mr Fly! Why are you so poor?

619
00:58:00,900 --> 00:58:02,424
搞到摆鱼蛋档？！
You don't have to sell fish-ball, do you?

620
00:58:03,003 --> 00:58:06,029
阴功罗
Poor guy

621
00:58:06,939 --> 00:58:08,803
一定是你大佬指使你的
It must be your Big Brother who told you to do so

622
00:58:09,675 --> 00:58:11,802
你呀就不要跟他了
You should leave your Big Brother

623
00:58:11,911 --> 00:58:15,403
你看我的马，个个身光颈靓
Look at my followers, all dressed up!

624
00:58:15,549 --> 00:58:17,448
摆大哥电话，用得着做吗？
Taking wireless telephone, do you need that?

625
00:58:17,984 --> 00:58:20,111
你跟的那个大佬
You bastard! Your Big Brother sent you

626
00:58:20,287 --> 00:58:21,651
叫你站在街上卖鱼蛋
selling fish-ball in the street

627
00:58:21,854 --> 00:58:23,378
跟我不是更好
Working for me is better!

628
00:58:23,623 --> 00:58:24,920
走鬼呀！
Escape

629
00:58:29,129 --> 00:58:31,256
走什么走呢？你是古惑仔呀
Escape for what? You are a gangster!

630
00:58:31,398 --> 00:58:32,762
有这么多兄弟在这里，你怕差人？！
We have so crowd of gangsters here! It's no need to afraid!

631
00:58:32,932 --> 00:58:33,727
动他呀！
Beat him!

632
00:58:36,236 --> 00:58:38,931
不用怕，有什么事进去了也不用怕
Don't be afraid! You'll be alright even if you're in jail

633
00:58:39,073 --> 00:58:40,370
有人敢动你马上还手
Fight back at one if someone beat you

634
00:58:40,507 --> 00:58:41,599
不要影衰班兄弟
Don't make us lose faces

635
00:58:42,209 --> 00:58:43,835
你这衰人，你…
You bastard, you...

636
00:58:44,011 --> 00:58:46,241
不用这么紧张，没事的
Take it easy! It's OK!

637
00:58:46,380 --> 00:58:48,745
你又不是卖白粉，只是卖鱼蛋嘛
You are not selling drugs, just fish-ball

638
00:58:49,849 --> 00:58:50,610
看戏！
Something good to be seen

639
00:59:24,984 --> 00:59:25,881
打四万啦！
Beat him!

640
00:59:39,333 --> 00:59:41,823
他妈的，别走呀！
Hey, don't go you bastard

641
00:59:42,569 --> 00:59:43,796
还走？
Don't go!

642
00:59:45,405 --> 00:59:46,531
去死啦！
Go to hell, bastard!

643
01:00:02,422 --> 01:00:04,389
拖他过来！
Take him here

644
01:00:14,001 --> 01:00:15,298
饮完啦！
Finished drinking

645
01:00:18,172 --> 01:00:20,105
对了，两箱鸡翼你猜有多少只？
Right! How many chicken wings are there in two boxes

646
01:00:21,542 --> 01:00:23,133
二、三百只啦！
About two or three hundreds!

647
01:00:24,511 --> 01:00:26,137
二、三百只？！
Two or three hundreds?

648
01:00:31,151 --> 01:00:33,517
喂，你回去了记得告诉你老板
Hey, go back and tell your boss...

649
01:00:33,653 --> 01:00:37,885
以后不要再叫你一个人搬
not to send you to take thing

650
01:00:38,125 --> 01:00:39,422
这么重的东西
so heavy alone

651
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:42,687
告诉他，一只鸡翼打一捶
Or else, I'll give him one fist for one wing in return

652
01:00:43,629 --> 01:00:44,561
神经病！
You are crazy

653
01:00:44,697 --> 01:00:45,685
我神经病？
I am crazy?

654
01:00:48,968 --> 01:00:50,696
是不是不想我帮你？
Do you want me to help you?

655
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:53,361
无所谓，反正我都不打算做了
It's OK! Anyway, I will quit!

656
01:00:53,706 --> 01:00:58,302
不做，为什么？
Quit! Why?

657
01:00:59,946 --> 01:01:01,971
我想到九龙去找工做
I want to find a job in Kowloon

658
01:01:03,883 --> 01:01:06,511
好呀，方便我，搬到我家来呀
Good! It's doing me favour! You can live in my house!

659
01:01:08,355 --> 01:01:09,946
你不要讲第二次
Don't say the second time

660
01:01:10,723 --> 01:01:12,281
讲了第二次就收不回了
You can't deny it if you say it twice

661
01:01:14,027 --> 01:01:15,687
我不是讲笑的
I'm not kidding!

662
01:01:16,896 --> 01:01:18,658
我出了去就不会再回来
I go out and will never come back

663
01:01:30,210 --> 01:01:31,642
喂，你吃什么呀？
Hey, what do you want to eat?

664
01:01:40,853 --> 01:01:43,344
你告诉他，我会准时上竹馆找他
Tell him that I'll go to find him on time

665
01:01:43,856 --> 01:01:45,881
如果乌蝇少了一条毛，唯他是问
If Fly has anything wrong, he'll pay for it

666
01:01:46,126 --> 01:01:46,955
就这样啦
It's finished!

667
01:01:48,661 --> 01:01:49,685
什么事呀？
What's the matter?

668
01:01:50,330 --> 01:01:52,729
没什么，我现在要出去，乌蝇出了事
Nothing special! Fly has some problem and I'm going out now

669
01:01:52,932 --> 01:01:54,092
会不会有危险？！
Would it be dangerous?

670
01:01:54,301 --> 01:01:57,498
没事的，我今晚就回来放心
No, it'll be alright, I'll be back tonight

671
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:09,173
土申叔，这么多人呀？
Uncle Kwan, so many people here?

672
01:03:09,343 --> 01:03:12,311
华仔，这件事是乌蝇不对
Ah-wah, it's Fly doing wrong in this case

673
01:03:12,512 --> 01:03:15,776
不过，大家是自己人，无谓搞大了
But, I don't want to make it big since we all know each other

674
01:03:16,249 --> 01:03:19,046
过去跟TOny讲几句好话吧！
Say something good to Tony & the case will be settled

675
01:03:29,196 --> 01:03:32,631
TOny，乌蝇就算有什么不对
Tony, no matter what did Fly do,

676
01:03:32,765 --> 01:03:34,198
我都会执行家法
I'll punish him according to my rules

677
01:03:34,867 --> 01:03:36,300
请你把我细佬交给我
So please give me back my brother

678
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:39,870
细佬？！什么细佬呀？
Brother? What kind of brother?

679
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:42,872
这个是细佬吗？你喜欢掩住你的细佬
Is this a brother? You like to protect your brother

680
01:03:43,043 --> 01:03:44,976
现在掩住他呀
now you are protecting him!

681
01:03:45,644 --> 01:03:49,444
同我玩花样？是好马就该掩住他
Making fun of me? You should protect him if he is good

682
01:03:49,615 --> 01:03:52,584
你掩住“劈”屎，你怎么做人大佬呀
Now you are just protecting a lump of shit How can you be a Big Brother?

683
01:03:52,752 --> 01:03:54,719
TOny，拿回个彩就算了
Tony, stop when you have some advantage

684
01:03:54,887 --> 01:03:55,716
无谓去得这么尽
Don't go too far

685
01:03:55,888 --> 01:03:59,289
坤叔，你省省吧，我是教识他做人
Uncle Kwan, save it for yourself! I'm teaching him to grow up

686
01:04:00,060 --> 01:04:02,255
他的马可以这样对我
His gangster can treat me like this

687
01:04:02,828 --> 01:04:04,795
将来你们还有地方立足吗？
Where can we stand in the future then?

688
01:04:05,599 --> 01:04:08,123
人呢，我一定会做
I'll release him surely!

689
01:04:08,368 --> 01:04:11,268
不过一定要我麻，我的要求好低
But I must be satisfied My requirement is low

690
01:04:11,438 --> 01:04:13,132
只要你讲一句我喜欢听的
Just say one sentence I like

691
01:04:13,340 --> 01:04:14,568
我就速速放人
I'll release him

692
01:04:20,380 --> 01:04:21,937
这句说话你喜不喜欢听？
Do you like to hear these words

693
01:04:21,981 --> 01:04:23,039
你要不要你弟弟？
Do you want your brother?

694
01:04:23,183 --> 01:04:24,046
华仔！
Ah-wah!

695
01:04:44,204 --> 01:04:45,727
大佬！
Big Brother

696
01:04:51,077 --> 01:04:52,271
你好！
Are you alright?

697
01:04:55,215 --> 01:04:56,273
能不能走？
Can you walk?

698
01:04:58,318 --> 01:04:59,512
能！
Yes, I can

699
01:05:09,563 --> 01:05:12,053
你的“靓”扶起他，叫呀！
Tell your follower to help him stand

700
01:05:12,532 --> 01:05:13,520
扶起他！
Help him stand

701
01:05:15,168 --> 01:05:18,501
不用，我自己起来！
No, I can stand by myself

702
01:05:47,833 --> 01:05:49,323
我自己走可以了
I can walk by myself

703
01:06:02,048 --> 01:06:03,106
不要过来
Don't get near to me

704
01:06:05,285 --> 01:06:06,148
大佬！大佬！
Big Brother! Big Brother!

705
01:06:15,694 --> 01:06:16,786
我告诉你们俩
I tell you two,

706
01:06:16,929 --> 01:06:18,896
这件事就算找天皇出来也没得拆
this case can't be settled even if you bring the highest King

707
01:06:32,145 --> 01:06:36,911
乌蝇，这件事情肯定还有下文
Fly, this case certainly won't end up this way

708
01:06:37,083 --> 01:06:38,071
这些钱你拿去
You take this money

709
01:06:38,385 --> 01:06:40,909
回调景岭要等事情淡了些才好出来
And go back to Til-gang Lin and wait for the case to fade out

710
01:06:41,087 --> 01:06:42,111
我不回去！
I won't go!

711
01:06:42,821 --> 01:06:43,412
我发过誓
I've made a vow

712
01:06:43,622 --> 01:06:45,920
我不发达就不回调景岭见我老妈
I won't go back to see my mother if I do not succeed

713
01:06:47,826 --> 01:06:50,920
好，我同你去大屿山
OK, I go to Lantau Island with you

714
01:06:52,465 --> 01:06:53,624
为什么你一定要我走呢？
Why do you drive me away so insistly?

715
01:06:53,766 --> 01:06:57,099
为什么？我不想明天你一出门口
Why? I don't want you to be killed tomorrow

716
01:06:57,337 --> 01:06:58,701
就被人斩开几碌
when you go out

717
01:06:59,838 --> 01:07:00,998
你明知道那只是癫狗
You know he is just a mad dog

718
01:07:01,174 --> 01:07:03,267
为什么你不听我的话，偏要去惹他
Why don't you listen to me not to provoke him?

719
01:07:03,476 --> 01:07:06,774
不是我惹他，是他先来惹我呀
It's him who provoked me, I didn't provoke him

720
01:07:06,946 --> 01:07:09,380
难道我不该玩他，现在我玩他不起吗
Don't you think I should just about it! I have the power to play, haven't I?

721
01:07:10,749 --> 01:07:12,148
你玩得起吗？！
Don't you have the power to play with him?

722
01:07:13,219 --> 01:07:16,153
你玩得起就不会被人打到像个猪头炳
If you have, you won't be beaten so heavily and have face swollen up

723
01:07:19,159 --> 01:07:21,956
是，我是被人打得像猪头炳
Yes, I was beaten to have face swollen

724
01:07:22,095 --> 01:07:24,359
你嫌我映衰你，就别理我好了
You are blaming me on losing you face, you can leave me alone

725
01:07:29,569 --> 01:07:34,562
是你自己说的，不要贪口爽呀
No one force you to speak this Don't speak it for fun

726
01:07:36,209 --> 01:07:37,869
我现在就不理你
I leave you alone now

727
01:07:38,144 --> 01:07:39,577
如果你明天出门口没事的话
If you are safe when you go out tomorrow

728
01:07:39,812 --> 01:07:41,143
我就替你挽鞋
I'll do anything for you

729
01:08:23,822 --> 01:08:26,086
我们一向都不知道明天会怎么样？
We all don't know what will happen tomorrow

730
01:08:26,992 --> 01:08:28,016
对不对？
Do you agree?

731
01:08:39,072 --> 01:08:39,901
去宵夜
Let's go eating out!

732
01:08:43,476 --> 01:08:44,407
走啦
Come along!

733
01:09:18,445 --> 01:09:19,274
打他
Beat him!

734
01:09:23,749 --> 01:09:26,240
乌蝇，我灭你，我灭死你呀！
Fly, I twist your face I twist you to death

735
01:09:29,189 --> 01:09:31,248
这次我还暗算不到你
I can plot against you this time, can't I?

736
01:09:32,492 --> 01:09:33,753
你不要打我大佬呀
Don't beat my Big Brother

737
01:09:33,892 --> 01:09:37,089
和他无关的，要打便打我吧
Leave him alone. Just beat me up

738
01:09:37,230 --> 01:09:38,890
打你，我还打得你不够麻呀
Not enough?

739
01:09:39,032 --> 01:09:41,523
我现在打埋你大佬，待你们相映成趣
Let me beat your brother up. That makes you two pairs

740
01:09:41,667 --> 01:09:44,101
我要你亲眼看着，我怎样玩残你大佬
I want you to see how I fool around your brother

741
01:09:44,270 --> 01:09:45,498
他妈的
Shit

742
01:09:49,576 --> 01:09:50,906
反抗呀
fight back

743
01:09:55,148 --> 01:09:57,275
我TOny这份人是最讲公道的
I, Tony, is very justified

744
01:09:57,816 --> 01:10:01,547
你怎样对我，我就怎样对你了
An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth

745
01:10:05,691 --> 01:10:09,923
你别动呀，你那里是最敏感的
Don't move! It's the most sensitive place of you

746
01:10:10,096 --> 01:10:12,496
你一动，就不知道会射到那里去了
I don't know where will you eject if you move

747
01:10:19,172 --> 01:10:23,336
真行，这次真好彩
Great! I'm lucky this time

748
01:10:23,443 --> 01:10:27,071
跟着不知道会不会这么好彩呢？
Will I still be so lucky next time?

749
01:10:30,949 --> 01:10:32,416

You are so excited

752
01:10:38,657 --> 01:10:40,522
你千万不要动
You cannot move a little

753
01:10:41,094 --> 01:10:43,687
一动就不知道会射到这个细佬
You will eject on this brother

754
01:10:43,829 --> 01:10:45,490
还是那个细佬
or that if you move

755
01:10:49,835 --> 01:10:56,035
不要衰给人家看，知道吗？
Don't let them look down on you?

756
01:10:57,010 --> 01:10:59,478
如果大佬今天没命走出去
If I cannot escape today

757
01:11:00,280 --> 01:11:01,940
你就回调景岭去
You must go back to Til-gang Lin

758
01:11:02,248 --> 01:11:05,411
不要再出来蒲了，知不知道？
& never go out again

759
01:11:10,023 --> 01:11:11,547
硬汉
Tough guy

760
01:11:11,690 --> 01:11:13,817
不过不知道硬不硬过我这个东西
But whether you are tougher than this thing

761
01:11:15,495 --> 01:11:17,428

762
01:11:17,564 --> 01:11:22,262
硬是吗…硬是吗…
Very, hard, isn't it... very hard isn't it...

又玩谢了一件
Another one collapsed

765

你这衰仔，你赖尿呀
Damn you! You are pissing!

766
01:12:01,574 --> 01:12:04,474
你呀应该替他穿了尿片才出来走嘛
You should wear him a napkin before taking him out

767
01:12:04,643 --> 01:12:07,305
人做大佬，你做大佬
What kind of Big Brother are you?

768
01:12:09,249 --> 01:12:12,446
对了，  “得”低个头
Right! Let your head down

769
01:12:12,684 --> 01:12:15,312
用尿照照自己的衰样
so that you can see your face by the urine

770
01:12:16,256 --> 01:12:18,815
看看怎么会这么失败
And see why you are such a failure

771
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:24,495
然后陪你的威威大佬回乡下耕田
Then, go back to your motherland and farm with your Big Brother

772
01:12:25,697 --> 01:12:29,895
市区的路，不是你们走的，明不明白
Urban road is not suitable for you? Do you understand?

773
01:12:53,992 --> 01:12:56,586
没事啦，没事
It's alright, alright!

774
01:13:03,602 --> 01:13:06,696
你…去那里？
Where... are you going?

775
01:13:14,746 --> 01:13:16,713
我不配做你细佬
I'm letting you lose face

776
01:13:17,783 --> 01:13:19,716
你就当没我这个细佬
Just treat that you've never know me

777
01:13:21,387 --> 01:13:23,854
我都不会再连累你
From now on I have no business to do with you

778
01:13:24,023 --> 01:13:25,649
由我自生自灭啦
Just leave me alone

779
01:14:34,926 --> 01:14:37,486
表哥
Cousin

01:14:42,335 --> 01:14:44,462

快点开门呀
Hurry up! Open the door!

783
01:14:52,412 --> 01:14:53,139
什么事？
What's the matter?

784
01:14:53,312 --> 01:14:54,608
我表哥跌伤了
My cousin felt to the ground & hurt himself

785
01:14:59,985 --> 01:15:02,146
他没事，先让他休息一会
He's alright. Let him take a rest first

786
01:15:09,694 --> 01:15:10,991
你昨晚去了那里？
Where have you been last night?

787
01:15:13,433 --> 01:15:14,593
我同表哥在一齐
I was staying with cousin

788
01:15:24,010 --> 01:15:25,840
你走的时候帮我锁门
Lock the door when you leave!

789
01:15:26,978 --> 01:15:28,808
如果有什么事CaII我好了
Give me a phone if anything happens

She's coming

不好意思呀
I'm sorry

793
01:16:19,898 --> 01:16:21,195
你们慢慢谈吧
You talk to each other first

794
01:16:32,011 --> 01:16:35,139
在差馆开枪嘛，未必会死人的
Shooting in a police station won't cause death penalty

795
01:16:35,548 --> 01:16:37,208
好彩的就坐三、五、七年
Go to jail for several years

796
01:16:37,383 --> 01:16:38,713
出来就是大人啦
and become a man when you come out!

797
01:16:39,452 --> 01:16:41,180
现在人家叫你银仔
Now people call you boy,

798
01:16:41,320 --> 01:16:43,048
将来就叫你做银哥
and they'll call you "sir" tomorrow

799

想起朵就靠这镬了，知道吗？
It's a chance to be famous! Understanding?

801
01:16:48,528 --> 01:16:52,463
什么？不敢，抽到签你说不敢？
What? Afraid! You've drew the lots and now you said you afraid

802
01:16:52,631 --> 01:16:55,964
就算我不出声，兄弟们都会劈死你

805
01:17:02,441 --> 01:17:03,372
没出息
Chicken-hearted

806

啊！做了爸爸真是不同的
You're a different person after you become a fahter

01:17:27,799 --> 01:17:30,563
无办法，仔细老婆嫩
I have no choice. I have a young wife and baby

812
01:17:30,969 --> 01:17:32,596
为生活，什么也要做的
I'll do anything for living

813
01:17:33,372 --> 01:17:38,001
是的，这些钱拿去吧，拿着

01:17:38,244 --> 01:17:38,937
做什么呀
What are you doing?

815
01:17:39,512 --> 01:17:40,978
大佬应允了你的
I promised you

816
01:17:42,481 --> 01:17:44,072
上次委屈了你
I'm sorry for last time

817
01:17:45,084 --> 01:17:48,883
今次找一间又贵又不饱补请亲戚朋友
Please find a luxurious resturant this time

818
01:17:50,822 --> 01:17:53,619
剩下的钱，留给儿子摆满月酒
And the lest of the money is for the celebratim of your son's first month

819
01:17:54,893 --> 01:17:58,158
记住，不要衰给老婆外家看
Remember, don't let your wife's famlty look down on you

820
01:17:58,331 --> 01:18:00,230
争一口气，明白吗？
Do you understand?

821
01:18:00,399 --> 01:18:01,160
那些钱怎样得来的？
How can you get the money?

822
01:18:01,334 --> 01:18:03,733
不要理我，不要理我好不好
It's none of your business

823
01:18:13,778 --> 01:18:18,215
迟些大佬不在，有事便找华哥
I'll not around. Call borther wah if you get in trouble

824
01:18:21,953 --> 01:18:24,319
你跟了我这么久，什么大事也没做过
We didn't do any big thing

825
01:18:24,823 --> 01:18:26,290
我做大佬的很惭愧
I feel ashamed

826
01:18:27,193 --> 01:18:27,920
大佬，你不要这样说
Don't say that, brother

827
01:18:28,027 --> 01:18:29,153
听我说完先
Linsten to me

828
01:18:36,935 --> 01:18:46,936
我知，以前在你心里，可能会小看我
You may despise me in the past

829
01:18:51,350 --> 01:18:56,447
是的，我是值得给人小看的
Yes, I deserve that

830
01:18:57,656 --> 01:19:07,054
但是过两天，你看报纸，看电视
But 2 days later, when you read paper and watch TV

831
01:19:08,633 --> 01:19:12,433
你便知你大佬乌蝇不是莫姜的
You'll realize that I'm not an idiot

832
01:19:16,375 --> 01:19:18,400
我够资格做你大佬有余
I can be your big brother

833
01:19:30,523 --> 01:19:35,687
记得告诉人，你今天有个很劲的大佬

Do these clothes suit you?

836
01:20:12,331 --> 01:20:13,991
整晚没睡，去休息一下吧
You didn't sleep the whole night! Take a rest!

837
01:20:15,934 --> 01:20:17,026
我睡不着
I can't sleep!

838
01:20:27,279 --> 01:20:31,477
不用担心，是皮外伤，无事的
Don't worry! Just slight injury! It's alright!

839
01:20:32,551 --> 01:20:35,348
今次就说好彩无事，那下次呢？
You're lucky this time, but what about the next time?

840
01:20:37,022 --> 01:20:38,648
我做事从来没想过下次
I've never thought about next time in doing anything

841
01:20:40,493 --> 01:20:46,021
除了一样，就是下次我出香港
Just one thing

842
01:20:47,299 --> 01:20:49,061
我要你跟我一齐出去
I want to be with you next time when I go touring

01:21:08,154 --> 01:21:14,149
来呀，来呀，过来呀

847
01:22:10,449 --> 01:22:12,006
叫我再摆一次酒
and told me to hold banquet again

848
01:22:12,551 --> 01:22:13,915
他说过两天后看报纸
And he said I would know

849
01:22:14,186 --> 01:22:15,551
就知道他不是莫姜
he was not coward when I read newspaper two days later,

850
01:22:15,687 --> 01:22:17,211
华哥，你快点出来呀
Brother Wah, would you come out at once

851
01:22:18,923 --> 01:22:21,289
你不理他，就没人理他啦
Nobody will care about him if you don't

852
01:22:32,037 --> 01:22:33,402
我现在出来

01:22:39,911 --> 01:22:40,808

Going out again?

854

叫我出去聊聊

857
01:22:47,419 --> 01:22:48,579
去买两剂铁打药

858
01:23:10,209 --> 01:23:11,574
有没有什么东西要买？
Do you want me to buy anything for you?

说跌打药买不买不要紧

上数
Count it later

867
01:25:40,758 --> 01:25:43,454
为什么转了地方也不通知我，TOny哥
Why not tell me you're changed your address, Tony?

868
01:25:45,297 --> 01:25:46,627
起身…
Get up...

869
01:25:46,764 --> 01:25:49,164
你知不知这里打几大呀
Do you know the game rules here?

870
01:25:51,136 --> 01:25:52,693
是不是不招呼我呀
You don't welcome me?

871
01:25:55,240 --> 01:25:58,300
拿些安家费来益我
Give me money

872
01:25:59,044 --> 01:26:00,670
我惊会折堕
I don't want to be screwed up

你呀，你已经堕到尽了
You're been screwed up

874
01:26:06,984 --> 01:26:09,111
日日食长斋，生仔也不会有屁股
Even you feel sorry, your son will have no ass

875
01:26:09,254 --> 01:26:09,776
你说什么呀靓仔

给他威两天好了
Let him be the boss 2 days

878
01:26:13,825 --> 01:26:17,056
他成世也未威过，他拿了性命来搏的
He never be the boss. He risks his lefe for that

879
01:26:17,296 --> 01:26:20,162
威两天也不能，乌蝇哥是吗？
Just 2 days

880
01:26:24,536 --> 01:26:25,934

你打我一下，我立即躺在这里
I'll lie down

895
01:27:37,642 --> 01:27:43,171
打我呀…

射爆你的头
Let me blow off your head

906
01:28:24,556 --> 01:28:28,218
不要…，不要开枪呀乌蝇哥
No..., don't shoot him

907
01:28:28,427 --> 01:28:30,520
我本来想一枪射死他
I wanted to shoot him

908
01:28:30,695 --> 01:28:32,595
但你不配
But you're not worth to be shot

909
01:28:35,700 --> 01:28:39,329
这些钱还给你的，拾吧
These are the money that I owe you. Take it

910
01:28:41,173 --> 01:28:44,438
一定要拾，不拾便没有机会的
You must take it. Or you'll lose your chance

911
01:28:44,576 --> 01:28:47,271
我一枪射死你的，拾吧
Take it. Or I'll shoot you

912

说声多谢乌蝇哥

穿西装打太，拿大哥大电话有用吗？

跟着这些大佬
Be the man of such brother

916
01:29:12,770 --> 01:29:14,465
食屎啦你
And you'll go to hell

917
01:29:26,351 --> 01:29:27,840
大家出来求财的
We just want to make money

918
01:29:27,985 --> 01:29:30,351
他还钱给我也不要吗？
You mean I shouldn't take the money even he pay me back?

919
01:29:31,023 --> 01:29:32,251
拿去跳舞吧
Take it and go dancing

920
01:29:37,195 --> 01:29:40,323
喂！不是这样对大佬呀
You treat your brother like that

921
01:29:53,744 --> 01:29:57,611
喂，妈，我在士多，你上来好吗？
I'm in grocery, mon. Do you come up?

922
01:29:58,083 --> 01:29:59,175
什么事呀？
What is going on?

923
01:29:59,451 --> 01:30:01,384
没有，我知你怕热
Nothing. I know you don't like feeling hot

924
01:30:01,619 --> 01:30:03,484
买了一部冷气给你
So I buy you a air conditioner

925
01:30:04,289 --> 01:30:07,621
我们下面装了，你留给自己用吧
We're installed it down there. This one just leave in to you

926
01:30:08,826 --> 01:30:11,556
我不上来了，你爸爸在
I don't come up. Your father is here

927
01:30:12,431 --> 01:30:14,796
那个是你老公，不是我爸爸
He's your husband, not my father

928
01:30:50,768 --> 01:30:52,395
你走到几时才安乐呀
When will you calm down and stop escaping?

929
01:30:53,271 --> 01:30:54,760
你出来找我做什么？
Why did you come out to see me?

930
01:30:55,940 --> 01:30:57,498
你不要理我好不好？
Why don't you leave me alone?

931
01:30:59,244 --> 01:31:02,475
我不理你？我不理你那个理你呀？
Who will care for you if I don't?

932
01:31:09,221 --> 01:31:11,688
不要以为做完这件事就好威了
Don't think that you'll be famous after this task

933
01:31:13,724 --> 01:31:19,458
对，你今天做完，个个就会说你够姜
Right, everybody will say you are brave this time when you do that

934
01:31:21,133 --> 01:31:23,294
下个礼拜，还有人知道你是那一个
But no one will remember you next week

935
01:31:24,536 --> 01:31:25,968
但是那又怎么样？
But what become of you then?

再迟点就没有人认识你乌蝇啦
No one will know you later

我也为阿公做了不少事
I've done many things for godfather also

938

我十四岁，十四岁就拿安家费
I had received money for death when I was fourteen

939
01:31:54,199 --> 01:31:55,756
我威过好多人啦？
I was greater than a lot of people, right?

940
01:31:56,801 --> 01:31:59,735
那又怎么样？现在不也是这个样子
But look at me! I'm just an ordinary man now

941
01:32:00,072 --> 01:32:03,768
你威风，你总算威风过呀
Anyway, you were famous for sometime!

942
01:32:04,875 --> 01:32:08,106
我呢？我怎么样？
But what about me?

943
01:32:10,748 --> 01:32:13,979
没有人看得起我，你就开心啦
No one notice me and you are happy about that

944
01:32:14,486 --> 01:32:16,385
我样样都被人家看小
People look down upon everything of me

945
01:32:16,687 --> 01:32:19,485
他们还说我是你裤档里的一条狗

946
01:32:19,657 --> 01:32:20,954
你知不知道？
Do you know that?

01:32:24,695 --> 01:32:27,629
我乌蝇宁愿做一日英雄
I would rather be three-minute hero

948
01:32:27,832 --> 01:32:29,765
都不想做一世乌蝇
I don't want to be a fly for all my life

949
01:32:32,070 --> 01:32:34,765
你让我一手一脚的做一件事好不好？
Let me finish a great task on my own, would you?

950
01:32:35,440 --> 01:32:36,872
就这一次啦
Just for this time

951
01:32:51,456 --> 01:32:56,893
好，你是不是决定要去？
OK! Did you decide to go?

952
01:32:58,530 --> 01:33:00,292
如果你去我就陪你去
I'll go with you if you want to

953
01:33:01,466 --> 01:33:03,194
要是你被人射到了我都替你补飞
I'll take revenge for you if you are shoot down

954
01:33:03,368 --> 01:33:06,200
你不要对我这么好呀，行不行？
Don't treat me so good, would you?

955
01:33:10,342 --> 01:33:12,241
我还你不起的
I can't pay you back

956
01:33:13,844 --> 01:33:15,834
我不想跟你讲这么多话
I don't want to talk so much with you

957
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:18,107
只要你说去，我就陪你去
Just say it, and I'll go with you

958
01:33:19,551 --> 01:33:23,543
如果你不去的话，一齐回大屿山
We'll go to Lantau Island if you say no

959
01:33:26,824 --> 01:33:28,791
以后的事，我会搞定
I'll settle anything following

960
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:40,334
好！好！好！
OK! OK! OK!

961
01:33:40,539 --> 01:33:41,800
我跟你回去
I go back with you

962
01:33:57,688 --> 01:33:58,985
阿财，阿财，你不要看不起人
Ah-choi, Ah-choi

963
01:33:59,191 --> 01:34:00,680
怎么你残成这样？
Don't look down upon other

964
01:34:01,193 --> 01:34:03,559
快点同大佬打招呼了
He used to be great and famous but now he was finished

965
01:34:05,030 --> 01:34:08,591
不要这么独食，分一些给阿财啦
Don't be so stingily! Give something to Ah-cho
