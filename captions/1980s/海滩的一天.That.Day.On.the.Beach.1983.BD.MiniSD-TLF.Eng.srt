1
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:37,790
What you just heard,

2
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:41,749
is Beethoven's No.3 Piano concerto.

3
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:43,540
Played by the young pianist

4
00:01:43,625 --> 00:01:48,665
Miss Tan Wei-Ching.

5
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:50,624
As you know,

6
00:01:50,708 --> 00:01:54,415
Miss Tan is having her concert
at the concert hall

7
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,457
tomorrow night.

8
00:01:57,375 --> 00:02:00,124
She just returned today.

9
00:02:00,208 --> 00:02:01,624
She is very busy,

10
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:02,749
But luckily,

11
00:02:02,833 --> 00:02:05,665
We invited her to our program,

12
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,915
To talk to the classical music fans

13
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,249
in the air.

14
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:09,999
Hello,

15
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,540
Hello, Miss Tan.
- Please put me to extention number 2681.

16
00:02:11,625 --> 00:02:13,665
Hello, everyone.

17
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,124
Hello,

18
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,957
can I speak to Jian Lan Shin
from the cultural vision?

19
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:23,832
Hey Lan Shin, I am Jia-Li

20
00:02:23,916 --> 00:02:26,874
Do you know the pianist who just returned,

21
00:02:26,958 --> 00:02:31,374
Tan Wei-Ching?

22
00:02:31,458 --> 00:02:32,957
After the concert tomorrow,

23
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:34,874
I will go to the Japan.

24
00:02:36,625 --> 00:02:39,165
How long have your travel abroad?

25
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,415
13 Years.

26
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,499
Wow! 13 years. - Right.

27
00:02:42,583 --> 00:02:44,624
Is this your first time back to Taiwan?

28
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:45,999
Yes

29
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,457
How come it take so long?
Are you busy at work?

30
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:53,040
At first I stayed in school

31
00:02:53,125 --> 00:02:54,415
practice a lot.

32
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,374
I also participated
several competitions in Europe.

33
00:02:57,458 --> 00:02:59,415
There are many competions in a year.

34
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,124
One after another.

35
00:03:02,208 --> 00:03:05,207
I need to gain more experience.

36
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:08,499
Then I started to played in concert,
one after another.

37
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,707
Can you tune for me? The touch is loose.

38
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:12,165
Of course. But, it'll take time.

39
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,790
Can you start now and finish tonight?

40
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,832
Certainly.

41
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,374
The hotel room is settled.

42
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:27,082
They found the luggage.
It's in your room now.

43
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:30,999
This is for you, from the hotel.

44
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:29,707
What's wrong?

45
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:32,249
It's nothing.

46
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,374
My sister is bringing me clean clothes.

47
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:37,999
How come she's not here yet?

48
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,082
She's in Taipei?

49
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:40,790
Just moved up.

50
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:44,082
That's right. High school starts
a week earlier than we do.

51
00:07:01,375 --> 00:07:03,165
Look at that dummy!

52
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,665
Jia-Li, over here...

53
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:09,665
This is Ching-Ching. Tan Wei-Ching

54
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,290
Hello.

55
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:14,457
Cat got your tongue? Introduce yourself!

56
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:18,582
Jia... I'm Lin Jia-Li.

57
00:07:22,875 --> 00:07:24,207
Are you OK?

58
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:31,665
Just a little tired.
I think I'll go back to my hotel.

59
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:33,749
The press conference is at three.

60
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:38,457
The limousine will be
at the hotel at five-thirty,

61
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,374
then to dinner and the concert hall by seven.

62
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:45,749
There's a cocktail party in your honor
after the performance.

63
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:56,415
We must leave no later than nine
in the morning...

64
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,957
Our Cathay Pacific Flight 450
leaves for Tokyo at 10:50 a.m.

65
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,957
And we arrive three hours later...

66
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:14,207
Don't forget the press at three.

67
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:20,582
Birgit come over.

68
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:50,540
Hi

69
00:11:50,625 --> 00:11:51,749
You're back.

70
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:27,457
Father.

71
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:51,499
How is the weather in Taipei?

72
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:55,540
It seems so much hotter than
usual this year.

73
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:34,290
This is the photo I took
in competition when I was little.

74
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:34,999
Is this you?

75
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,082
Yes.

76
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:36,915
This is Jia Sen.

77
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,165
He was the champion.

78
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,707
And this?

79
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,707
I don't remember.

80
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:43,415
He looks like his mom.

81
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,082
They said I look like dad.

82
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:46,874
Agree.

83
00:13:50,291 --> 00:13:55,040
I didn well in pathology and analysis.

84
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,790
But when it comes to dissection,

85
00:13:58,875 --> 00:14:02,582
I always feel...

86
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,415
Don't worry.

87
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:08,915
I'll give you a little practice
during the vacation.

88
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,957
But you must force yourself
to watch during surgery.

89
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,249
The closer you look

90
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:17,165
the quicker you'll get used to it.

91
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,207
How do you like it?

92
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,457
What did you say?

93
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,665
Do you feel at home here?

94
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:30,707
It's fine.

95
00:14:30,791 --> 00:14:33,249
Just smells a little like a hospital.

96
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:45,040
Can we cancel this afternoon's
press conference?

97
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,082
I'll see what I can do...

98
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,540
But why?

99
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:53,374
There's someone I must go and see.

100
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,999
It's that hotel message, isn't it?

101
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,999
I don't know if I should go or not.

102
00:15:09,250 --> 00:15:11,415
You go if you think you should.

103
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,207
But remember,

104
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:19,332
A pianist should concentrate
on the performance.

105
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:28,457
Relax and I'll take care of
the press conference.

106
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:07,165
How did you find me?

107
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:11,332
From a journalist friend.

108
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:20,540
Hot coffee.

109
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,290
How long has it been?

110
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:30,957
13 years.

111
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:45,290
You left in a hurry.

112
00:16:45,375 --> 00:16:47,790
I'm not even sure when you left.

113
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,665
The scholarship was a bit of a surprise.

114
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,957
School was starting and they expected me
in Vienna right away.

115
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,874
I was in a rush.

116
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:08,624
I guess a lot of water has passed
under the bridge...

117
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,290
But I think you ought to know.

118
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,499
I tried more than once
to get in touch with you.

119
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:18,790
I wanted to tell you...

120
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,957
Is Ching-Ching home, Mrs. Tan?

121
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,290
No, she's not in.

122
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,124
When will she be back?

123
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:37,290
I'm not sure.
She's been getting in very late lately.

124
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:45,915
It was only later
I heard you'd gone to Europe.

125
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:53,207
Do you remember

126
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:55,624
the summer before my college
freshman year?

127
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:01,665
Come on. Choose one.

128
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:05,082
Call it my graduation gift.

129
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:06,665
Go ahead dummy!

130
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,124
My paycheck can take it.

131
00:19:02,041 --> 00:19:03,790
It's from Ching-ching.

132
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:12,207
What's up?

133
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,124
Can't bare to go home
and leave Ching-ching?

134
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:22,582
Home to dinner with Dr. Chen.

135
00:19:23,708 --> 00:19:25,874
Still trying to set you up with his daughter?

136
00:19:33,416 --> 00:19:37,499
Dr. Chen and dad were
at medical school together in Japan.

137
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,457
They grew up together.

138
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:42,374
Chen's practive

139
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,915
is as well-known as Dad's.

140
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:54,499
School starts in July, doesn't it, Jia Sen?

141
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:58,165
So it's settled.

142
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:02,790
You'll exchange rings
with Wan-jen in early July,

143
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:06,374
and we'll set the wedding
for the Autumn festival.

144
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:07,957
Or should we wait another month
until Confucius' Day?

145
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:11,207
Everyone has a day or two off.

146
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,540
They will be able to come.

147
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,082
What do you think?

148
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,832
It's fine if you don't have other oppinions.

149
00:20:23,916 --> 00:20:28,999
Then Tetso can attend his sister's wedding
before he goes overseas.

150
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:31,540
Tetso, if possible,

151
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:34,207
you'll have you Ph. D, in four years.

152
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,415
Jia-li will graduate at that time.

153
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,874
I'll be out of another wedding gift!

154
00:21:07,875 --> 00:21:11,790
I hardly even know Wan-jen.

155
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:15,624
If you marry Wan-jen,

156
00:21:15,708 --> 00:21:18,290
what about Ching-Ching?

157
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,374
It's not fair.

158
00:24:15,291 --> 00:24:17,040
What's your problem?

159
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:19,999
You know.

160
00:24:20,083 --> 00:24:23,957
Jia-sen is taking the whole thing
very sensibly.

161
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:57,499
Jia-sen?

162
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:51,665
He certainly knew
how to let himself off the hook.

163
00:25:52,625 --> 00:25:55,165
No, I shouldn't have said that.

164
00:25:55,250 --> 00:25:57,040
What chance do we have

165
00:25:57,125 --> 00:26:00,874
when it comes to honor... face.

166
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:03,582
It's all so superficial.

167
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:12,915
Sometimes my hypocrisy scares me.

168
00:26:14,291 --> 00:26:20,082
The way we protect ourselves is phoney.

169
00:26:21,125 --> 00:26:25,749
Like insects changing its colors.

170
00:26:32,208 --> 00:26:36,040
To tell the truth,
I had no desire to go abroad.

171
00:26:37,458 --> 00:26:40,999
All I ever wanted was to make
a little money teaching,

172
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:43,499
and wait for your brother graduate.

173
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:48,957
But we broke up.

174
00:26:51,625 --> 00:26:53,749
Everything changed.

175
00:26:54,583 --> 00:27:00,540
All that was left was the music.

176
00:27:03,125 --> 00:27:06,707
And all I wanted was to leave.

177
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:12,207
I know you came looking for me,

178
00:27:13,125 --> 00:27:15,290
but what use was there in meeting?

179
00:27:20,041 --> 00:27:24,040
Words couldn't change a thing.

180
00:27:32,125 --> 00:27:34,249
Is Ching-ching home, Mrs. Tan?

181
00:27:34,333 --> 00:27:35,165
No, she isn't in.

182
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:35,957
Will she be back soon?

183
00:27:36,041 --> 00:27:38,874
I'm not sure. She's been getting in very late.

184
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:43,457
Please give this letter on to her.

185
00:27:43,541 --> 00:27:45,040
Sure. - Thank you.

186
00:27:45,125 --> 00:27:46,207
Goodbye.

187
00:27:52,416 --> 00:27:54,165
This is for you.

188
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,207
I hadn't the courage
to see you to this very day!

189
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,999
Married?

190
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:56,999
Your parent's choice?

191
00:29:21,291 --> 00:29:22,665
What're you having?

192
00:29:30,375 --> 00:29:31,790
It's Ah-Tsai.

193
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:33,249
Ah-Tsai! Over here!

194
00:29:40,333 --> 00:29:41,332
Sit here!

195
00:29:45,708 --> 00:29:46,665
I'm Ah-Tsai.

196
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:51,124
This is Chen De-Wei. What do they call you?

197
00:29:51,208 --> 00:29:53,540
Lin Jia-li. Western Languages.

198
00:29:55,791 --> 00:29:56,457
Interested?

199
00:29:56,541 --> 00:29:57,707
Not specially.

200
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:01,165
All right!

201
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:18,832
Afterwards?

202
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:16,457
This dump is mine, now.

203
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,665
Everything you see is mine.

204
00:31:22,291 --> 00:31:23,582
I can hardly hear myself think.

205
00:31:23,666 --> 00:31:26,749
My old man picked up the mortgage

206
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:29,832
when a friend of his went broke.

207
00:31:29,916 --> 00:31:33,540
Now the old man's passing it on to me.

208
00:31:34,625 --> 00:31:36,040
No power?

209
00:31:36,125 --> 00:31:36,832
No water.

210
00:31:36,916 --> 00:31:39,332
Little fucker couldn't pay.
They cut if off eons ago.

211
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:42,707
When do you move in?

212
00:31:42,791 --> 00:31:43,540
Who knows.

213
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:44,582
Possibly next week

214
00:31:44,666 --> 00:31:46,915
My old man might
have to mortgage it himself!

215
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,165
Creep!

216
00:33:16,875 --> 00:33:18,624
De-wei is a bit of a childish.

217
00:33:18,708 --> 00:33:20,832
But he's straight,
and that has its advantages.

218
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,082
No matter what,

219
00:33:24,708 --> 00:33:25,915
At least he won't walk out,

220
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,624
unless you drop him first.

221
00:33:31,041 --> 00:33:33,124
Take a chance

222
00:33:33,208 --> 00:33:36,082
You can always find someone else,

223
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:39,582
if you're not satisfied.

224
00:33:39,666 --> 00:33:40,499
And he'll always be around,

225
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:42,207
if you don't find anything better.

226
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:46,707
De-wei'll be training all summer.

227
00:34:46,791 --> 00:34:48,249
What about you? Going home?

228
00:34:51,791 --> 00:34:53,249
Let's get together before you go

229
00:34:53,333 --> 00:34:55,249
Bye!

230
00:36:20,791 --> 00:36:22,290
Are you all done with your finals?

231
00:36:24,125 --> 00:36:25,915
One more to go.

232
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,374
Ah-Tsai stole his Dad's money
to play the market.

233
00:36:28,458 --> 00:36:31,082
His old man caught him,
now he's afraid to go home.

234
00:36:38,375 --> 00:36:41,124
I'm leaving for the army tomorrow.

235
00:36:42,416 --> 00:36:44,124
I know

236
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:38,749
Your family never interfered?

237
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:46,957
Father was a little more tactful with me.

238
00:37:49,166 --> 00:37:50,957
As soon as I graduated.

239
00:37:51,041 --> 00:37:53,665
He rented out the Taipei house

240
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:56,124
I had no choice but to move back home.

241
00:37:59,791 --> 00:38:01,874
It was only with De-wei gone off to the army

242
00:38:01,958 --> 00:38:05,332
that I realized he wasn't there anymore,
I was kind of dazed.

243
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:07,165
At that time,

244
00:38:07,250 --> 00:38:09,207
I hardly know what I was doing.

245
00:38:09,916 --> 00:38:13,790
Four years of college were over just like that

246
00:38:15,333 --> 00:38:17,374
Like everyone else,

247
00:38:17,458 --> 00:38:20,040
I took a toefl tested and applied to schools,

248
00:38:20,125 --> 00:38:23,665
I don't know what I really want.

249
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:40,624
De-wei wrote me often during his service;

250
00:39:41,458 --> 00:39:44,957
He's no poet,

251
00:39:45,041 --> 00:39:47,790
but his letters gave me

252
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:51,415
a sense of contentment.

253
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:55,624
But two years is a long time to wait,

254
00:39:55,708 --> 00:39:58,624
and he often asked me

255
00:39:58,708 --> 00:40:00,790
to meet him in Taipei.

256
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,415
Come, Jia-li.

257
00:40:45,750 --> 00:40:49,499
An American Ph.d.
In just four and half years.

258
00:40:49,583 --> 00:40:51,457
Tetso's no fool.

259
00:40:51,541 --> 00:40:56,165
Your father always hoped
you would marry such a man.

260
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:58,707
You should keep that in mind,

261
00:40:58,791 --> 00:41:02,332
and think a little of your future.

262
00:41:25,208 --> 00:41:30,124
It's hard to imagine a more satisfying day
in my whole life!

263
00:41:30,208 --> 00:41:33,040
Dr. Chen and I have agreed

264
00:41:33,125 --> 00:41:38,207
on an August engagement.

265
00:41:38,291 --> 00:41:40,582
Jia-li can then go abroad with Tetso

266
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:45,082
just in time for school.

267
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:48,332
A son and a daughter.

268
00:41:48,416 --> 00:41:50,874
It's all settled.

269
00:41:50,958 --> 00:41:55,040
So that's a great weight off my mind.

270
00:42:21,875 --> 00:42:30,249
My ideas have changed a lot since college.

271
00:42:31,291 --> 00:42:34,540
People say I have matured.

272
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:43,040
I think it's more a question of the way

273
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:45,457
we'd idealize things

274
00:42:45,541 --> 00:42:48,540
and the extent of our ambition.

275
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:50,499
And now?

276
00:42:53,083 --> 00:42:55,290
I try not to expect too much of the future.

277
00:42:55,375 --> 00:43:00,124
I don't ask much,

278
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:05,874
Just hope for

279
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,707
a share of the small pleasures of life.

280
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:15,290
Like a good piece of music

281
00:43:15,375 --> 00:43:20,374
or a letter from old team-mates
back in college.

282
00:43:27,416 --> 00:43:31,082
But I have no right
to be telling you what to do.

283
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:34,832
What can I possibly tell you?

284
00:43:41,041 --> 00:43:45,165
I just wanted to know are you happy?

285
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:51,915
First tell me what you call "happiness?"

286
00:44:04,958 --> 00:44:07,457
With all that education

287
00:44:07,541 --> 00:44:11,332
you should know what happiness is.

288
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:14,540
De-wei it's for you!

289
00:46:59,416 --> 00:47:00,582
Have a sit.

290
00:48:53,958 --> 00:48:56,957
I'll arrange a couple of tickets for my concert.

291
00:48:57,041 --> 00:48:59,374
Bring De-wei along.

292
00:49:04,625 --> 00:49:08,499
Not tonight.

293
00:49:11,750 --> 00:49:14,790
I... let me put it this way

294
00:49:14,875 --> 00:49:19,915
Something happened three years ago.

295
00:49:22,583 --> 00:49:28,249
I remember it so clearly-like that morning.

296
00:49:30,125 --> 00:49:32,707
The air so fresh and full of promise.

297
00:49:32,791 --> 00:49:35,332
For the first time in my life I knew

298
00:49:35,416 --> 00:49:37,415
a kind of contentment.

299
00:49:37,500 --> 00:49:40,874
I could almost smell
the greenness of the leaves.

300
00:49:43,166 --> 00:49:45,957
I walked all the way home.

301
00:49:46,041 --> 00:49:48,832
I hadn't felt so good in ages.

302
00:49:51,541 --> 00:49:56,374
But the moment I walked
in the apartment door.

303
00:49:58,208 --> 00:50:00,624
The maid told me

304
00:50:04,208 --> 00:50:12,165
the police had found De-wei on some beach;

305
00:50:13,833 --> 00:50:15,915
Drowned.

306
00:51:34,666 --> 00:51:38,499
The duty officer will be a while.

307
00:51:38,583 --> 00:51:42,624
He's getting some coastguard frogmen

308
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:45,332
to drag for your husband's body.

309
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:53,707
How did it happen?

310
00:51:57,208 --> 00:52:01,790
It's none of my business, really.

311
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:03,374
But as far as I can tell...

312
00:52:05,541 --> 00:52:06,915
I'd collected my nets

313
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,749
and was on my way home
last night around dusk.

314
00:52:08,833 --> 00:52:10,415
There was this city guy;

315
00:52:10,500 --> 00:52:11,832
tall and skinny... sitting over there;

316
00:52:11,916 --> 00:52:14,415
I could see it clear as day, he was frowning.

317
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:22,499
I saw him too, it was darker now.

318
00:52:22,583 --> 00:52:25,749
I thought it was strange

319
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:29,957
to go swimming at that time of day.

320
00:52:30,041 --> 00:52:31,582
I truned and looked

321
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,290
Later, after dinner,

322
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:47,749
must've been around eight,

323
00:52:47,833 --> 00:52:50,082
When the tide was high...

324
00:53:07,916 --> 00:53:12,624
We were down on the beach
around dawn this morning.

325
00:53:12,708 --> 00:53:16,040
And found these things of your husband's

326
00:53:23,083 --> 00:53:26,915
A bottle with your husband's name.

327
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:33,332
It was... Cheng... De-wei, right?

328
00:53:33,416 --> 00:53:37,582
The Duty Officer looked forever
in the phonebook,

329
00:53:37,666 --> 00:53:44,207
before he found that...
something Luo's Health Clinic,

330
00:53:46,708 --> 00:53:52,082
But I don't remember my husband
going to any Dr. Luo

331
00:53:52,166 --> 00:53:54,707
Do you think it might be
some other Chen De-wei?

332
00:53:54,791 --> 00:53:56,915
I'm not too clear.

333
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,165
You should ask the officer

334
00:54:00,250 --> 00:54:01,040
Wait here.

335
00:54:01,125 --> 00:54:02,915
He's coming.

336
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:56,124
Take care of this, will you?

337
00:54:56,208 --> 00:54:57,332
Ok.

338
00:54:57,416 --> 00:55:00,457
I've seen your translation, Miss Li

339
00:55:00,541 --> 00:55:02,249
It's not quite what I expected

340
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:04,207
from a language major like yourself.

341
00:55:04,291 --> 00:55:06,957
I don't want to tell you how to do your job

342
00:55:07,041 --> 00:55:09,457
You are in charge of the translation

343
00:55:09,541 --> 00:55:11,624
for all these documents in future.

344
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:14,457
Your incompetence is rather unsettling!

345
00:55:36,666 --> 00:55:37,624
Come on, De-wei

346
00:55:42,166 --> 00:55:43,415
You see

347
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:46,332
Come.

348
00:57:16,833 --> 00:57:17,749
Hey!

349
00:57:20,083 --> 00:57:21,499
What?

350
00:57:29,375 --> 00:57:30,624
De-wei!

351
00:57:33,833 --> 00:57:35,374
Where are you?

352
00:57:39,875 --> 00:57:41,457
What the hell's happened?

353
00:57:42,416 --> 00:57:43,582
Take your time.

354
00:57:50,208 --> 00:57:53,832
Ah-tsai announced his marriage
around this time

355
00:57:54,708 --> 00:57:56,415
The eternal playboy, Ah-Tsai

356
00:57:56,500 --> 00:57:59,790
with four or five girls forever in tow,
marrying!

357
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:05,874
T only made sense later, when we found out

358
00:58:05,958 --> 00:58:09,832
that he'd married
the daughter of some big financier.

359
00:58:10,875 --> 00:58:15,374
It came as no surprise when not much later

360
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:20,040
Ah-tsai was named his father-in-law's
new Corporate Chairman.

361
00:58:21,375 --> 00:58:23,457
Right away he strengthened his position

362
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:26,749
by gathering a loyal group of old buddies

363
00:58:26,833 --> 00:58:28,749
to work with him.

364
00:58:29,916 --> 00:58:34,624
De-wei and Ah-tsai had grown up together

365
00:58:34,708 --> 00:58:38,124
they were closest in school
or on the basketball court

366
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,082
they were even stationed
in the same army service unit

367
00:58:42,166 --> 00:58:44,624
So it was only natural

368
00:58:44,708 --> 00:58:47,415
that De-wei became
Ah-tsai's general manager

369
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:08,499
Morning call, Mr. Manager. Wake up, sir.

370
00:59:11,833 --> 00:59:13,957
Aren't you the one who's always saying

371
00:59:14,041 --> 00:59:16,790
Late managers get late workers?

372
00:59:16,875 --> 00:59:18,874
Just another five minutes.

373
00:59:19,458 --> 00:59:22,165
My head's killing me.

374
00:59:22,791 --> 00:59:25,582
Look who's complaining.

375
00:59:28,458 --> 00:59:30,540
It's not all dinner and dancing, you know

376
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:34,207
You can't imagine,

377
00:59:35,458 --> 00:59:37,749
there are so many things to do.

378
00:59:39,041 --> 00:59:41,249
Everyday's the same

379
00:59:42,583 --> 00:59:45,874
I arrive office, take off my coat,

380
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:49,540
and the day's already done.

381
00:59:51,250 --> 00:59:55,207
So I come home with this strange anxiety

382
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:58,082
that I've left so much undone

383
01:00:01,208 --> 01:00:04,582
Do you like hanging around here
or going to work better?

384
01:00:04,666 --> 01:00:06,790
I don't have my feet up all day either,
you know

385
01:00:07,375 --> 01:00:08,749
Even with a maid,

386
01:00:08,833 --> 01:00:11,290
there's a lot I take care of myself.

387
01:00:12,250 --> 01:00:15,957
Shopping, cleaning, pressing your clothes

388
01:00:17,375 --> 01:00:21,874
While you're working for others,
I'm here working for us

389
01:00:22,416 --> 01:00:24,582
I've been thinking of

390
01:00:26,833 --> 01:00:29,332
taking a class in flower arranging

391
01:00:30,833 --> 01:00:32,624
But it's still not fair

392
01:00:35,458 --> 01:00:37,082
I have to get up every morning,

393
01:00:37,166 --> 01:00:38,749
while you sleep in

394
01:00:47,916 --> 01:00:49,790
Next time you entertain,

395
01:00:49,875 --> 01:00:52,290
at least give me a call.

396
01:01:26,875 --> 01:01:29,832
Pay attention, now

397
01:01:29,916 --> 01:01:36,832
Fix the stem about one-third of the way in,

398
01:01:38,291 --> 01:01:46,832
with the chrysanthemums
at an angle of forty-five degrees

399
01:01:46,916 --> 01:01:52,957
Take care with the petals
to the front and back

400
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:31,124
Hsin-hsin

401
01:02:35,708 --> 01:02:36,540
Jia-li

402
01:02:43,583 --> 01:02:45,249
How old is your child?

403
01:02:46,208 --> 01:02:47,624
Come on over.

404
01:02:47,708 --> 01:02:49,124
I live nearby

405
01:02:49,958 --> 01:02:52,999
Not today. De-wei will be off any minute now

406
01:02:53,916 --> 01:02:55,874
So you did marry De-wei!

407
01:02:57,333 --> 01:02:59,749
He's hardly ever home for dinner...
he's working very hard

408
01:02:59,833 --> 01:03:01,249
So I want to be there for him tonight

409
01:03:04,166 --> 01:03:05,957
Promise to come and see me

410
01:03:07,666 --> 01:03:09,874
in a day or two

411
01:03:09,958 --> 01:03:11,832
there's so much I want to tell you!

412
01:03:16,916 --> 01:03:18,207
It's true.

413
01:03:19,875 --> 01:03:21,374
They will hold a singing competition?

414
01:03:24,416 --> 01:03:25,582
The wife if back.

415
01:03:29,958 --> 01:03:31,332
Let me help you

416
01:03:31,416 --> 01:03:32,707
I am late.

417
01:03:32,791 --> 01:03:33,874
We'll have to move fast

418
01:03:33,958 --> 01:03:35,249
De-wei'll be home any minute

419
01:03:36,083 --> 01:03:37,582
First, take a vase for the flowers

420
01:03:37,666 --> 01:03:38,582
OK.

421
01:03:38,666 --> 01:03:40,999
Then put the fruit in the fridge

422
01:03:41,083 --> 01:03:42,040
OK.

423
01:04:03,416 --> 01:04:04,332
Have her wait a moment

424
01:04:04,416 --> 01:04:05,415
OK

425
01:04:12,583 --> 01:04:13,165
Hello

426
01:04:14,208 --> 01:04:18,582
This is he.

427
01:04:20,916 --> 01:04:21,707
OK

428
01:04:24,375 --> 01:04:25,832
The deal is confirmed.

429
01:04:31,833 --> 01:04:32,957
Great!

430
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:40,957
We will make a fortune!
Cool, a 7 milliard deal!

431
01:04:43,791 --> 01:04:46,457
Let's party tonight!

432
01:04:47,583 --> 01:04:49,040
Let's go!

433
01:04:52,708 --> 01:04:54,040
You're still here.

434
01:04:54,125 --> 01:04:56,540
I will have a look of your proposal.

435
01:04:56,625 --> 01:04:58,040
Let's have dinner together.

436
01:04:58,791 --> 01:05:06,874
De-wei! Move your ass

437
01:06:58,375 --> 01:07:00,165
It didn't even cross your mind.

438
01:07:01,666 --> 01:07:04,332
Tonight is our third anniversary.

439
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,749
The apartment's my mother's.

440
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:28,040
After all the crap I've been through.

441
01:07:28,125 --> 01:07:30,624
I don't even end up with a place of my own!

442
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:51,540
Hush, too hot to sleep?

443
01:07:51,625 --> 01:07:54,832
Shh... Grandma will fan you

444
01:08:26,083 --> 01:08:28,499
All I got for my trouble was
that fatherless kid.

445
01:08:34,375 --> 01:08:36,207
Remember that visiting professor?

446
01:08:39,333 --> 01:08:41,915
I wasted two whole years with that bastard

447
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:44,457
expecting him to take me back to the States.

448
01:08:46,583 --> 01:08:48,582
Before I found out
he'd been married for years

449
01:08:58,875 --> 01:09:00,290
Next it was a businessman...

450
01:09:00,375 --> 01:09:01,999
Ah-tsai might know the guy

451
01:09:03,958 --> 01:09:07,290
He ran away and left debts.

452
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:11,624
He only left the baby.

453
01:09:19,125 --> 01:09:19,874
At that time,

454
01:09:19,958 --> 01:09:22,082
I don't know why I will keep the baby.

455
01:09:37,041 --> 01:09:38,374
How does De-wei treat you?

456
01:09:46,416 --> 01:09:48,207
De-wei's always been a straight-shooter

457
01:09:51,875 --> 01:09:53,415
Remember back in college

458
01:09:55,041 --> 01:09:57,290
how I'd always be telling you this
and showing you that

459
01:10:00,166 --> 01:10:02,790
I wish there was someone
who could teach me a thing or two, now

460
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:13,665
It's beautiful.

461
01:10:13,750 --> 01:10:15,165
Thank you.

462
01:10:15,250 --> 01:10:17,999
You're really making progress!

463
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:19,624
Very impressive.

464
01:10:19,708 --> 01:10:25,582
You have such lively color and line.

465
01:10:25,666 --> 01:10:28,499
I hope you will do
even more beautiful work at home

466
01:10:28,583 --> 01:10:29,874
Thank you, I will.

467
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:19,040
It's me. I can't come home tonight.

468
01:11:19,125 --> 01:11:22,332
I have to go first thing in the morning
to look over a Taichung site.

469
01:11:22,416 --> 01:11:24,415
I'll drive down there tonight.

470
01:11:24,500 --> 01:11:25,915
Don't wait for me.

471
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:27,499
OK

472
01:11:30,875 --> 01:11:32,082
Please.

473
01:11:36,791 --> 01:11:37,790
Come one.

474
01:11:39,958 --> 01:11:41,290
Stop.

475
01:11:47,833 --> 01:11:48,957
No.

476
01:13:44,291 --> 01:13:45,957
See, your wife

477
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:52,665
Go home, your wife if waiting.

478
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:53,832
Go home.

479
01:15:27,791 --> 01:15:30,707
De-wei

480
01:15:31,875 --> 01:15:33,582
Do you hear me? I'm talking to you!

481
01:15:35,291 --> 01:15:36,332
What is that supposed to mean?

482
01:15:36,416 --> 01:15:37,665
Are you trying to punish me?

483
01:15:39,625 --> 01:15:41,457
You think I want to snoop on you like this?

484
01:15:41,916 --> 01:15:43,165
It's been two years of
business trips and entertaining

485
01:15:43,250 --> 01:15:45,374
And not once have I questioned you,
or doubted what you've said

486
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:47,374
because I know you wouldn't tolerate it

487
01:15:48,458 --> 01:15:50,249
But you're gone from morning
until late at night

488
01:15:50,333 --> 01:15:51,915
without even a phone call sometimes

489
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:54,040
How should I know where you are?
Or who you're with?

490
01:15:54,125 --> 01:15:55,374
I wouldn't even know
if something'd happen to you

491
01:15:55,458 --> 01:15:56,874
All I can do is sit at home nursing my fears

492
01:15:56,958 --> 01:15:58,457
Maybe that's all you'll ever nurse!

493
01:15:58,541 --> 01:15:59,749
How often have I told you to stop worrying

494
01:15:59,833 --> 01:16:01,165
and to stay out of my work space

495
01:16:01,250 --> 01:16:04,374
I don't want you
to interfere my work or to worry.

496
01:16:04,458 --> 01:16:05,790
What did you want at the site?

497
01:16:05,875 --> 01:16:07,499
You make a fool of me.

498
01:16:07,583 --> 01:16:08,707
I am embarrassed.

499
01:16:08,791 --> 01:16:10,707
I work day and night.

500
01:16:10,791 --> 01:16:12,499
Where am I? How, for Christ's sake,
don't you know?

501
01:16:12,583 --> 01:16:13,165
I am working.

502
01:16:13,250 --> 01:16:14,999
I'm working for us.

503
01:16:15,083 --> 01:16:16,790
What do you know anyway,
except how to wait for me?

504
01:16:16,875 --> 01:16:20,499
What can you do?

505
01:16:23,125 --> 01:16:24,082
Flower arranging!

506
01:16:25,166 --> 01:16:26,457
Do you think I enjoy all this entertaining

507
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:28,457
I hate drinking.

508
01:16:29,291 --> 01:16:30,207
I throw up!

509
01:16:30,291 --> 01:16:32,082
All the next day, my head aches!

510
01:16:32,750 --> 01:16:36,332
I always have to measure up
to your standards

511
01:16:43,375 --> 01:16:46,415
It's taken me so long
to see just how selfish you are!

512
01:16:48,791 --> 01:16:50,207
Selfish?!

513
01:16:51,666 --> 01:16:53,624
If I come home to you every night for dinner,

514
01:16:53,708 --> 01:16:54,707
would it make you happy?

515
01:16:54,791 --> 01:16:56,415
Would I be less selfish?

516
01:16:58,833 --> 01:17:01,915
What about you!

517
01:17:03,291 --> 01:17:05,374
With your demands to come home
to keep you company

518
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:08,790
You don't call that selfish?

519
01:17:12,958 --> 01:17:13,874
De-wei,

520
01:17:14,541 --> 01:17:17,249
is there no chance
to get back to where we were?

521
01:17:17,916 --> 01:17:20,665
Don't you even have a little time
to share with me

522
01:17:20,750 --> 01:17:23,832
to bring a little warmth back to our home?
Are we family?

523
01:17:35,291 --> 01:17:37,457
With all that I've given you

524
01:17:37,541 --> 01:17:39,874
I just don't know what more you want

525
01:18:42,833 --> 01:18:43,499
Yes?

526
01:18:44,916 --> 01:18:45,874
Still tied-up?

527
01:18:47,416 --> 01:18:48,874
Will you be off soon?

528
01:18:52,875 --> 01:18:54,374
Still angry with me?

529
01:18:56,083 --> 01:18:57,040
Not really

530
01:19:13,083 --> 01:19:13,707
OK

531
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:16,874
What's going on?

532
01:19:17,666 --> 01:19:19,124
The old woman's spot-checking?

533
01:19:19,750 --> 01:19:21,874
Keep her in line, man!

534
01:19:26,083 --> 01:19:30,332
Catch you tonight, our old table!

535
01:19:37,916 --> 01:19:40,290
Don't come over... I'll pick you up

536
01:19:41,666 --> 01:19:42,707
Where are you?

537
01:19:49,875 --> 01:19:50,582
I know the place

538
01:19:53,833 --> 01:19:54,707
Can I help you?

539
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:58,415
I just want to let you know I moved

540
01:20:01,333 --> 01:20:02,665
Here's my new number

541
01:20:04,166 --> 01:20:06,249
I'll be getting my own place uptown

542
01:20:06,333 --> 01:20:08,040
As soon as this deal comes through

543
01:20:08,125 --> 01:20:09,790
I will move to TienMu

544
01:20:18,833 --> 01:20:20,290
Call me

545
01:20:27,375 --> 01:20:29,249
Have you been getting enough sleep?

546
01:20:37,625 --> 01:20:39,499
Where do you eat?

547
01:20:57,416 --> 01:21:00,582
Been anywhere in particular?

548
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:16,624
What are you trying to prove?

549
01:21:16,708 --> 01:21:18,499
I'm just showing a little concern.

550
01:22:06,583 --> 01:22:08,207
You wouldn't be afraid if you trusted me

551
01:22:20,833 --> 01:22:28,124
Jia-li

552
01:24:32,791 --> 01:24:34,207
Excuse me,

553
01:24:34,291 --> 01:24:36,207
Should we eat, Mrs. Cheng?

554
01:24:36,291 --> 01:24:38,290
Your husband's been and gone already

555
01:27:39,166 --> 01:27:40,915
I don't know you will come.

556
01:27:41,625 --> 01:27:42,749
I'm glad you're here

557
01:27:44,583 --> 01:27:47,082
You're just in time to identify these

558
01:27:47,166 --> 01:27:50,082
Then sign your name here...

559
01:27:54,833 --> 01:27:56,249
Is there anything else?

560
01:27:57,458 --> 01:27:59,915
You mean they're not your husband's?

561
01:28:02,333 --> 01:28:05,582
I'm not sure, I can't be certain.

562
01:28:11,291 --> 01:28:12,665
You should at least recognize this.

563
01:28:12,750 --> 01:28:13,915
It has his name on it.

564
01:28:17,416 --> 01:28:20,499
It was with all this stuff

565
01:28:20,583 --> 01:28:22,290
we found on the beach.

566
01:28:23,583 --> 01:28:24,832
It could not be wrong

567
01:28:24,916 --> 01:28:27,790
I spoke with this clinic on the label.

568
01:28:27,875 --> 01:28:29,374
About your husband's condition

569
01:28:29,458 --> 01:28:32,040
That's how I got your number.

570
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:33,707
His doctor gave it to me.

571
01:28:35,041 --> 01:28:36,499
But I really don't recall

572
01:28:36,583 --> 01:28:38,499
my husband seeing a psychiatrist.

573
01:28:42,541 --> 01:28:45,082
I suppose he was keeping
something from you.

574
01:28:45,625 --> 01:28:48,665
Logically speaking,

575
01:28:48,750 --> 01:28:51,040
There's no other explanation for his death.

576
01:28:51,125 --> 01:28:53,332
Since he was already
receiving this kind of treatment

577
01:28:53,416 --> 01:28:55,249
Do you think he might
have considered suicide?

578
01:28:56,958 --> 01:28:58,499
Only you could really know.

579
01:29:02,833 --> 01:29:04,624
Was there anything strange

580
01:29:04,708 --> 01:29:06,790
About his behaviour yesterday?

581
01:29:09,333 --> 01:29:10,540
I don't know.

582
01:29:10,625 --> 01:29:12,790
I haven't seen him for days

583
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,124
She still doesn't know!

584
01:29:19,041 --> 01:29:20,874
Maybe he didn't kill himself

585
01:29:21,708 --> 01:29:25,915
Maybe the medicine made him drowsy,
he laid down

586
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,499
and got carried off with the tide.

587
01:29:27,583 --> 01:29:28,832
It's possible, don't you think?

588
01:29:29,458 --> 01:29:32,749
Or maybe he swam way out

589
01:29:32,833 --> 01:29:35,665
and couldn't make it back.

590
01:30:21,833 --> 01:30:23,040
Honestly,

591
01:30:24,458 --> 01:30:26,332
I know something was wrong

592
01:30:27,041 --> 01:30:28,707
It's all different.

593
01:30:30,958 --> 01:30:32,790
I don't know

594
01:30:32,875 --> 01:30:34,832
how to find way out...

595
01:30:39,875 --> 01:30:41,249
I felt

596
01:30:42,333 --> 01:30:47,749
Jia-li and I are drifting further
and further apart.

597
01:30:54,625 --> 01:30:55,790
You know better than anyone what I...

598
01:30:56,583 --> 01:30:58,415
In these few years

599
01:30:58,500 --> 01:31:00,082
What I been through,

600
01:31:01,166 --> 01:31:02,957
what we been throguh

601
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:07,665
is different from anything she knows

602
01:31:10,041 --> 01:31:12,915
The only advice I can give you

603
01:31:14,416 --> 01:31:16,957
Speaking for myself and the boys...

604
01:31:17,916 --> 01:31:23,665
Don't let the external issues

605
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:25,915
influence your moods

606
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:28,290
and work

607
01:31:32,500 --> 01:31:35,374
You and I are basically different

608
01:31:35,458 --> 01:31:38,374
I've lived this way all my life

609
01:31:38,458 --> 01:31:40,290
So I can handle this kind of thing

610
01:31:40,375 --> 01:31:42,874
With one eye closed
and one hand tied behind my back.

611
01:31:42,958 --> 01:31:44,707
It's tough out there

612
01:31:47,208 --> 01:31:48,999
You should know

613
01:31:49,083 --> 01:31:52,249
This is a competetive world.

614
01:31:52,333 --> 01:31:55,957
The more time you waste on your minds

615
01:31:56,041 --> 01:31:58,499
The more people will surpass you.

616
01:31:59,875 --> 01:32:01,999
I'll be straight with you

617
01:32:02,083 --> 01:32:04,582
Don't think I will protect you
if you allow personal affairs

618
01:32:04,666 --> 01:32:06,957
to affect company interests

619
01:32:08,333 --> 01:32:10,957
just because you're one of
my right-hand men

620
01:32:11,041 --> 01:32:13,832
It's for that reason

621
01:32:13,916 --> 01:32:16,624
that I'll make an example of you.

622
01:32:27,125 --> 01:32:29,290
What kind of future did you have in mind?

623
01:32:29,375 --> 01:32:31,082
Do you call these days "happy"?

624
01:32:31,166 --> 01:32:33,124
Thanks for the encouragement.

625
01:32:33,208 --> 01:32:34,915
Why do you always...

626
01:32:36,125 --> 01:32:38,124
Trust me a little, won't you?

627
01:32:38,208 --> 01:32:41,540
Let me make a go of it. Just let me try!

628
01:32:41,625 --> 01:32:44,874
De-wei, everything you say

629
01:32:44,958 --> 01:32:46,040
is just one more excuse

630
01:32:46,875 --> 01:32:51,832
Cut if off, Jia-li

631
01:32:51,916 --> 01:32:53,999
I know you're dissatisfied at the moment

632
01:32:54,083 --> 01:32:56,499
Can't you think of tomorrow for a change?

633
01:32:56,583 --> 01:32:59,082
I promise things will be better

634
01:32:59,166 --> 01:33:01,582
Just be patient

635
01:33:04,708 --> 01:33:06,957
I don't know anymore.

636
01:33:07,666 --> 01:33:10,249
You sound like you're preaching

637
01:33:10,333 --> 01:33:11,790
Trust in the lord,

638
01:33:11,875 --> 01:33:13,999
And all your wrongs will be right...

639
01:33:14,083 --> 01:33:17,832
What the hell am I talking about?
What are you talking about?

640
01:33:19,458 --> 01:33:20,707
De-wei,

641
01:33:20,791 --> 01:33:22,915
Maybe it's all just too trivial to worry about

642
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:24,082
For God's sake, relax.

643
01:33:24,166 --> 01:33:26,957
But all I've ever prayed for is today

644
01:33:27,041 --> 01:33:29,749
Let's stop all this fighting now, please

645
01:33:32,166 --> 01:33:35,582
I only want to lean on you.
Just rest for awhile.

646
01:33:35,666 --> 01:33:38,290
I'm tired.

647
01:33:47,750 --> 01:33:50,040
You'll feel a lot better

648
01:33:50,500 --> 01:33:51,915
If you get away for awhile

649
01:33:54,791 --> 01:33:56,082
Trust me.

650
01:34:00,583 --> 01:34:03,165
In the future,

651
01:34:03,250 --> 01:34:06,874
I'm going to put you

652
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,624
in charge of all our Asian business.

653
01:34:11,708 --> 01:34:14,332
I think it'll do you good.

654
01:34:19,291 --> 01:34:20,707
What do you think?

655
01:34:38,333 --> 01:34:39,540
Okay

656
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:44,457
Hi! No trouble finding the place?

657
01:34:45,208 --> 01:34:46,290
Are you in a hurry?

658
01:34:46,375 --> 01:34:48,707
No. De-wei's abroad

659
01:34:51,583 --> 01:34:53,374
I'll just finish up here

660
01:34:53,458 --> 01:34:55,332
and we can get out for a breath of air

661
01:34:57,416 --> 01:34:59,290
When did you move in?

662
01:34:59,750 --> 01:35:01,499
A week or two ago.

663
01:35:01,583 --> 01:35:03,290
He's seven years younger than me

664
01:35:14,541 --> 01:35:15,582
I'd only known him a couple of weeks

665
01:35:15,666 --> 01:35:17,207
when he asked me to move in

666
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:19,457
Who could have guessed

667
01:35:19,541 --> 01:35:20,207
at my age?

668
01:35:20,291 --> 01:35:22,582
Things like this just happened.

669
01:35:23,958 --> 01:35:24,874
What about the chile?

670
01:35:24,958 --> 01:35:26,249
With my mother.

671
01:35:28,541 --> 01:35:29,624
You can relax in the other room.

672
01:35:29,708 --> 01:35:31,290
I'll be with you in a minute.

673
01:35:41,333 --> 01:35:41,957
Here

674
01:35:44,666 --> 01:35:45,832
Ping-ping

675
01:35:49,333 --> 01:35:50,499
This is Jia-li

676
01:35:50,583 --> 01:35:53,082
and he is Ping-ping,
my "old man's" best friend

677
01:35:53,166 --> 01:35:54,374
Get to know each other

678
01:38:20,791 --> 01:38:22,124
Hello?

679
01:38:30,958 --> 01:38:32,332
Alright

680
01:39:12,750 --> 01:39:14,499
What do you call that?

681
01:39:17,125 --> 01:39:21,165
Just an impulse

682
01:39:22,416 --> 01:39:24,790
I like your own look.

683
01:39:25,791 --> 01:39:27,874
I guess it was curiosity

684
01:39:28,583 --> 01:39:32,957
Ping ping is different... from others

685
01:39:33,041 --> 01:39:34,790
I have no idea

686
01:39:34,875 --> 01:39:36,457
What he really did

687
01:39:37,250 --> 01:39:39,415
He said he'd come home to write

688
01:39:39,500 --> 01:39:41,874
he'd travelled a lot- been everywhere

689
01:39:42,875 --> 01:39:45,457
I suppose that's why...

690
01:39:45,541 --> 01:39:48,749
he talked often of his travels

691
01:39:48,833 --> 01:39:54,540
to Europe, South America,
the Middle East, India, Nepal...

692
01:39:55,208 --> 01:39:56,874
It's true I get around

693
01:39:56,958 --> 01:39:59,249
but I haven't a penny to my name

694
01:40:00,041 --> 01:40:05,082
There's no way
I could ever settle down like you

695
01:40:05,166 --> 01:40:09,207
But maybe marriage isn't
just a question of money...

696
01:40:12,333 --> 01:40:14,874
I guess I've always been this way

697
01:40:14,958 --> 01:40:18,207
That's what I like about writing...

698
01:40:18,291 --> 01:40:21,249
With one book I can make enough...
if I sell... to go back on the road

699
01:40:21,333 --> 01:40:24,582
Then I travel and collect more ideas
for my next book

700
01:40:31,166 --> 01:40:33,665
It's with me all the time

701
01:40:34,875 --> 01:40:36,790
Like my watch

702
01:40:38,458 --> 01:40:40,249
In this way

703
01:40:40,333 --> 01:40:41,624
I can keep a record

704
01:40:41,708 --> 01:40:44,415
Of whatever comes in to my head

705
01:40:44,500 --> 01:40:45,874
Like some safe-deposit box

706
01:40:45,958 --> 01:40:48,790
for all those precious moments of life.

707
01:40:48,875 --> 01:40:50,499
What do you say?

708
01:40:55,208 --> 01:40:57,499
I guess I've never really

709
01:40:57,583 --> 01:41:00,332
thought of things that way

710
01:41:03,083 --> 01:41:04,957
Perhaps not

711
01:41:05,041 --> 01:41:11,165
but do you think
you'll always want things to be so simple?

712
01:41:26,625 --> 01:41:30,374
Why don't you come back with me tonight?

713
01:41:49,708 --> 01:41:53,082
Wait here. I'll get the car.

714
01:44:18,875 --> 01:44:20,040
Dad

715
01:44:22,000 --> 01:44:24,082
Are you feeling well?

716
01:44:24,166 --> 01:44:28,624
I'm not sure.
That's why I came for this checkup.

717
01:44:30,458 --> 01:44:31,874
And?

718
01:44:31,958 --> 01:44:34,374
The lab report is not in yet.

719
01:44:52,083 --> 01:44:54,332
How's things at home?

720
01:44:57,458 --> 01:45:03,290
T's difficult to keep the practice going

721
01:45:03,375 --> 01:45:08,790
Younger doctors aren't interested
in private clinics;

722
01:45:08,875 --> 01:45:16,165
They're not big enough,
and the equipment's too old

723
01:45:16,250 --> 01:45:20,665
Then there's long hours

724
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:24,832
We can't hold a candle to a big hospital

725
01:45:26,791 --> 01:45:32,457
Thank god Jia-sen is about ready
to take over.

726
01:45:32,541 --> 01:45:35,415
But it's going to be tough on him

727
01:46:19,333 --> 01:46:22,165
Excuse me, Mrs. Cheng?

728
01:46:23,375 --> 01:46:25,374
Could I have a word or two with you?

729
01:46:25,458 --> 01:46:27,082
I'm a colleague of De-wei's

730
01:46:28,125 --> 01:46:29,332
Come in

731
01:46:45,791 --> 01:46:46,832
Thank you

732
01:46:47,375 --> 01:46:50,165
My name is Liu. They call me Hsiao-hui

733
01:46:50,250 --> 01:46:51,040
What I am going to say

734
01:46:51,125 --> 01:46:53,999
might startle you a little

735
01:46:54,500 --> 01:46:56,457
But I hope you can appreciate

736
01:46:56,541 --> 01:46:58,415
That I bear you no malice

737
01:46:58,500 --> 01:47:00,790
I'm merely here to straighten the record.

738
01:47:04,791 --> 01:47:05,499
Now

739
01:47:06,625 --> 01:47:10,707
I have something here
that is rightfully yours...

740
01:47:17,375 --> 01:47:18,957
This is De-wei's writing.

741
01:47:19,625 --> 01:47:21,082
It's addressed to you

742
01:47:21,166 --> 01:47:23,832
But the letter inside is for you

743
01:47:29,500 --> 01:47:33,415
I believe you should've
received his letter to me!

744
01:47:46,875 --> 01:47:48,124
That's hardly necessary

745
01:47:48,208 --> 01:47:50,624
You can rest assured
that the letter inside is mine.

746
01:48:01,041 --> 01:48:03,249
He mixed the envelopes

747
01:48:12,833 --> 01:48:16,415
With all the married men
I've been with in the past

748
01:48:16,500 --> 01:48:19,582
Tok great pains not to intrude
on their family lives

749
01:48:20,541 --> 01:48:22,124
But in this case,

750
01:48:22,208 --> 01:48:23,582
Because of this,

751
01:48:24,166 --> 01:48:26,874
I cannot walk away,

752
01:48:26,958 --> 01:48:30,165
I felt obliged to speak with you frankly,

753
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:33,874
I sympathize your situations.

754
01:48:33,958 --> 01:48:35,915
After all, I'm a woman too

755
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:38,332
In fact, I believe I can even help you

756
01:48:38,416 --> 01:48:39,540
For your own benefit

757
01:48:39,625 --> 01:48:43,165
I'd advise you to get better prepared

758
01:48:43,250 --> 01:48:45,457
You must realize,

759
01:48:46,208 --> 01:48:48,499
That De-wei is not exactly full of confidence

760
01:48:49,083 --> 01:48:53,207
There's so much he's unsure of

761
01:48:53,958 --> 01:48:56,874
And he has a habit of avoiding issues

762
01:48:58,125 --> 01:49:01,832
This mistake with the letters
is a perfect example.

763
01:49:01,916 --> 01:49:03,957
He intentionally mixes the letters

764
01:49:04,833 --> 01:49:06,999
Only he will do things like this.

765
01:49:07,083 --> 01:49:08,540
On the one hand,

766
01:49:08,625 --> 01:49:10,749
He wants to tell you his difficulties

767
01:49:11,208 --> 01:49:13,957
On the other hand, he wants me to forgive

768
01:49:14,041 --> 01:49:16,540
his inability to explain things to you.

769
01:49:16,625 --> 01:49:18,540
By the time he returns

770
01:49:18,625 --> 01:49:20,999
our reactions to the situation allow him
a fairly simple choice.

771
01:49:21,083 --> 01:49:23,790
From the beginning,

772
01:49:30,625 --> 01:49:33,999
I suppose I can see

773
01:49:34,083 --> 01:49:37,790
De-Wei is the most inexperience man
in the company

774
01:49:38,875 --> 01:49:42,415
Winning him over was my only hope

775
01:49:42,500 --> 01:49:45,249
Of access to that tight group of theirs

776
01:49:46,666 --> 01:49:50,457
Perhaps others will say I used him

777
01:49:50,541 --> 01:49:52,082
During this period of time, however,

778
01:49:52,166 --> 01:49:53,582
I've stood by him

779
01:49:53,666 --> 01:49:55,957
And helped him through many difficulties

780
01:49:59,333 --> 01:50:01,665
Perhaps that's just one more reason

781
01:50:01,750 --> 01:50:04,957
He can't seem to do without me

782
01:50:15,625 --> 01:50:17,082
I must leave

783
01:50:18,958 --> 01:50:21,707
The only other thing I wanted to tell you

784
01:50:21,791 --> 01:50:23,124
Is not to lose anymore sleep
over De-wei and me

785
01:50:23,208 --> 01:50:26,415
We're through

786
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:29,374
This whole thing

787
01:50:29,458 --> 01:50:31,624
has brought me too much trouble.

788
01:50:33,291 --> 01:50:35,832
And I hate trouble

789
01:50:44,416 --> 01:50:48,499
Just one question. Do you love him?

790
01:50:52,708 --> 01:50:54,415
I imagine that you grew up

791
01:50:54,500 --> 01:50:57,582
In a very peaceful, story-book world

792
01:50:59,833 --> 01:51:02,624
The world I grew up in taught me

793
01:51:02,708 --> 01:51:04,790
That it's a world without love

794
01:51:07,250 --> 01:51:10,040
Perhaps you will find a moment
or two of passion...

795
01:51:10,125 --> 01:51:12,124
But there's not much

796
01:51:28,125 --> 01:51:30,374
So we've read all these books

797
01:51:30,458 --> 01:51:34,999
And taken test after test

798
01:51:35,083 --> 01:51:36,999
But nobody's taught us

799
01:51:37,083 --> 01:51:39,874
How to handle the big questions like this

800
01:51:43,250 --> 01:51:47,040
In every book, and every movie

801
01:51:47,125 --> 01:51:51,415
It's always the same

802
01:51:52,416 --> 01:51:54,707
They all marry and live happily ever after

803
01:51:54,791 --> 01:51:56,207
But after that?

804
01:51:57,708 --> 01:51:59,582
Nobody told us.

805
01:52:01,000 --> 01:52:03,749
And there's no practice run
or on-the-job training

806
01:52:14,750 --> 01:52:17,165
I haven't slept in days.

807
01:52:18,583 --> 01:52:20,374
I can't

808
01:52:21,541 --> 01:52:25,999
I lie down and my mind is full of questions

809
01:52:27,375 --> 01:52:30,040
De-wei will be back in a few days

810
01:52:32,583 --> 01:52:34,874
But I don't know how to face him

811
01:53:19,458 --> 01:53:21,374
These might help

812
01:53:21,458 --> 01:53:22,665
Get a good night's rest.

813
01:53:22,750 --> 01:53:24,957
At least it'll help you forget

814
01:53:38,041 --> 01:53:40,165
Do you think you'll divorce De-wei?

815
01:53:48,333 --> 01:53:53,124
It'd be such a waste to give up just like that

816
01:56:38,375 --> 01:56:39,957
Where's Jia-li?

817
01:56:40,041 --> 01:56:41,624
Where does she go?

818
01:57:15,583 --> 01:57:17,499
Where am I?

819
01:57:19,000 --> 01:57:20,957
I must leave.

820
01:57:21,041 --> 01:57:23,040
De-wei is getting off work.

821
01:57:26,625 --> 01:57:27,874
Take it easy,

822
01:57:29,416 --> 01:57:33,415
Mrs. Cheng
Relax, you're still weak

823
01:57:33,500 --> 01:57:35,874
Just now,

824
01:57:35,958 --> 01:57:38,457
When the doctor was in to see you

825
01:57:38,541 --> 01:57:41,832
He left specific instructions for you
to get more rest

826
01:57:45,583 --> 01:57:47,332
Hsin-hsin have you been here long?
- Take a good rest.

827
01:57:48,000 --> 01:57:50,290
Will you keep me company?

828
01:57:52,541 --> 01:57:53,999
I will.

829
01:57:55,208 --> 01:57:57,499
You're the only one left

830
01:58:00,708 --> 01:58:03,124
It's like we're back in school again

831
01:58:22,958 --> 01:58:24,040
I'm done.

832
01:58:38,416 --> 01:58:39,832
You've hardly touched it

833
01:58:41,458 --> 01:58:42,790
I don't have an appetite

834
01:58:49,625 --> 01:58:50,749
De-wei's here

835
01:59:26,250 --> 01:59:28,249
I didn't know you were coming

836
01:59:28,333 --> 01:59:29,999
Otherwise

837
01:59:30,083 --> 01:59:32,165
I would've done something
about the way I look...

838
01:59:32,250 --> 01:59:33,957
I'm a mess

839
01:59:51,750 --> 01:59:54,082
We haven't really talked for ages

840
01:59:56,500 --> 01:59:58,624
Do you remember

841
01:59:58,708 --> 02:00:02,040
How we'd talk half the night sometimes

842
02:00:03,750 --> 02:00:05,915
I often wonder

843
02:00:07,041 --> 02:00:10,332
If we know each other so well now

844
02:00:11,083 --> 02:00:13,290
That there's no need for words

845
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:19,207
Or is this what marriage does to people?

846
02:00:19,291 --> 02:00:21,915
Leaves them with nothing left to say?

847
02:00:23,333 --> 02:00:24,874
I know

848
02:00:26,125 --> 02:00:28,040
There are plenty of problems

849
02:00:28,125 --> 02:00:30,749
waiting you to solve

850
02:00:30,833 --> 02:00:32,665
And worries you want to forget

851
02:00:33,875 --> 02:00:36,790
I know the last thing you want
when you come home

852
02:00:36,875 --> 02:00:40,124
Is to go through all that hassle again

853
02:00:43,250 --> 02:00:44,624
But

854
02:00:44,708 --> 02:00:48,332
I try... I've tried so hard

855
02:00:48,416 --> 02:00:52,624
To find something else we could discuss

856
02:00:56,041 --> 02:00:57,207
It's hard...

857
02:00:59,791 --> 02:01:03,749
Harder than any test I can think of.

858
02:01:06,458 --> 02:01:12,749
The whole society seems designe to
tear husband and wife apart...

859
02:01:13,875 --> 02:01:17,415
Men have their male places to go, and

860
02:01:18,958 --> 02:01:21,040
women have a world of their own

861
02:01:22,250 --> 02:01:27,999
Sunday is the only time left to be together.

862
02:01:28,083 --> 02:01:29,749
But you said

863
02:01:29,833 --> 02:01:32,165
Sunday is your basketball day.

864
02:01:34,333 --> 02:01:38,124
So... what day does that leave for us?

865
02:01:44,750 --> 02:01:47,790
I know people
who say our problem's no kids.

866
02:01:50,041 --> 02:01:51,790
I disagree.

867
02:01:54,166 --> 02:02:00,499
If we can't convince even ourselves

868
02:02:00,583 --> 02:02:03,082
Life means happiness and contentment

869
02:02:04,250 --> 02:02:07,624
How can we ever bring
a child into the world?

870
02:02:07,708 --> 02:02:10,374
Come with me, I'll bring you happiness

871
02:02:10,458 --> 02:02:12,374
That would be irresponsible.

872
02:02:13,333 --> 02:02:15,165
Don't you agree?

873
02:02:29,958 --> 02:02:32,207
These days I've been sleeping heavily

874
02:02:32,916 --> 02:02:35,249
And while I was sleeping

875
02:02:36,583 --> 02:02:40,915
I couldn't stop seeing
these years as a dream

876
02:02:42,291 --> 02:02:46,165
Our marriage was yesterday...
just before I slept

877
02:02:50,375 --> 02:02:54,582
We forget dreams. Don't we?

878
02:02:58,541 --> 02:03:00,499
Can't we?

879
02:03:39,958 --> 02:03:41,999
Mrs. Cheng...

880
02:04:11,958 --> 02:04:14,332
De-wei must be busy lately

881
02:04:40,833 --> 02:04:43,290
Jia-li

882
02:04:44,000 --> 02:04:45,374
Come

883
02:10:06,958 --> 02:10:08,499
Mom.

884
02:10:09,791 --> 02:10:13,415
I am disappointing you?

885
02:10:13,500 --> 02:10:15,832
Will you blame me?

886
02:10:15,916 --> 02:10:19,790
I was wrong.

887
02:11:10,708 --> 02:11:12,707
Mom

888
02:11:12,791 --> 02:11:15,165
Have you ever been afraid?

889
02:11:15,250 --> 02:11:20,040
Afraid that papa would walk out someday?

890
02:11:21,041 --> 02:11:22,999
That there'd be no one to take care of you?

891
02:11:32,041 --> 02:11:33,874
He's always been such a child.
What is there to be afraid of?

892
02:11:33,958 --> 02:11:35,874
It was I who took care of him!

893
02:11:35,958 --> 02:11:37,832
I scare of nothing.

894
02:11:57,833 --> 02:12:00,415
It's a change for me to make the move

895
02:12:01,458 --> 02:12:03,957
instead of waiting to be walked out on

896
02:12:06,791 --> 02:12:09,124
Hsiao-jiang's too young

897
02:12:09,208 --> 02:12:13,124
There's so much he has yet to do

898
02:12:16,875 --> 02:12:17,582
I guess I knew all along

899
02:12:17,666 --> 02:12:19,999
Nothing much would come out of it

900
02:12:23,250 --> 02:12:25,165
Thank God we were reasonably in control
when we broke up,

901
02:12:25,916 --> 02:12:32,874
No violence or bloodshed!

902
02:12:43,000 --> 02:12:44,999
De-wei's pretty much the same

903
02:12:45,083 --> 02:12:47,790
Even a little busier than before

904
02:12:47,875 --> 02:12:50,082
He's usually not at home.

905
02:12:51,708 --> 02:12:56,332
But I have this kind of premonition...

906
02:12:58,875 --> 02:13:01,040
That he's going through something

907
02:13:01,833 --> 02:13:06,374
Just last week
he took me out walking for a change

908
02:13:44,916 --> 02:13:46,415
But on the last couple of days

909
02:13:46,500 --> 02:13:48,374
Who knows where he's gotten himself off to

910
02:13:49,666 --> 02:13:51,290
I slowly appreciate

911
02:13:51,375 --> 02:13:53,957
just how much pressure he's under

912
02:13:55,041 --> 02:13:57,499
I could almost feel it
in my bones this last time

913
02:13:57,583 --> 02:13:59,665
He went off.

914
02:14:01,708 --> 02:14:03,499
I guess I'm getting used to it

915
02:14:04,291 --> 02:14:08,249
The way he comes and goes

916
02:14:10,791 --> 02:14:12,124
But I think

917
02:14:12,916 --> 02:14:15,582
If we can look at the bright side,

918
02:14:15,666 --> 02:14:17,790
And trust each other enough

919
02:14:18,541 --> 02:14:20,874
I think we'll pull through

920
02:14:23,541 --> 02:14:28,290
We've found new hope and beginning

921
02:14:28,375 --> 02:14:29,999
After all these years

922
02:15:25,833 --> 02:15:29,040
Babe, why don't you sleep?

923
02:15:29,125 --> 02:15:30,832
Why are you awake?

924
02:15:32,708 --> 02:15:34,124
What's wrong

925
02:15:35,416 --> 02:15:36,415
Look

926
02:15:40,833 --> 02:15:45,624
What's that?

927
02:15:48,375 --> 02:15:49,874
A bird.

928
02:15:50,958 --> 02:15:53,290
A bird is saying good morning to babe.

929
02:16:29,416 --> 02:16:30,290
Mrs. Cheng

930
02:16:33,166 --> 02:16:35,290
When exactly was it

931
02:16:35,375 --> 02:16:37,040
That you last saw your husband,
Mrs. Cheng?

932
02:16:37,958 --> 02:16:40,207
Can you describe what he was wearing?

933
02:16:41,666 --> 02:16:46,040
Do you suppose he
was in some kind of trouble?

934
02:16:46,125 --> 02:16:49,165
Just who has he spent
the last few days with?

935
02:16:50,125 --> 02:16:51,832
I really have no idea!

936
02:16:56,666 --> 02:16:57,665
You mean there's not a single thing

937
02:16:57,750 --> 02:17:00,290
you can give us to work on?

938
02:17:01,750 --> 02:17:03,040
Forget it.

939
02:17:03,125 --> 02:17:05,749
Let's get on with the search.
We can talk later

940
02:17:05,833 --> 02:17:08,457
Let's go. - How can I make my report

941
02:17:08,541 --> 02:17:10,457
with her humming and hawing like this?

942
02:17:13,083 --> 02:17:14,874
All I'm asking
is whether or not it's her husband!

943
02:17:16,500 --> 02:17:19,540
What kind of a wife can't answer
a question as simple as that?

944
02:17:46,250 --> 02:17:47,415
What are they up to now?

945
02:17:50,416 --> 02:17:52,082
What are you doing here?

946
02:17:53,916 --> 02:17:55,999
It's a little off the beaten track, isn't it?

947
02:17:57,416 --> 02:18:01,665
I wanted to talk a few things over with you.

948
02:18:01,750 --> 02:18:03,707
But there's no way to call you here

949
02:18:03,791 --> 02:18:08,082
Anyway, I thought I'd better
tell you in person.

950
02:18:13,458 --> 02:18:14,665
You know

951
02:18:15,750 --> 02:18:18,790
I grew up with De-wei

952
02:18:20,583 --> 02:18:22,332
We've played basketball together
all our lives.

953
02:18:29,416 --> 02:18:33,999
Which makes it all
the more difficult for me to tell.

954
02:18:36,625 --> 02:18:38,749
Befero I drove here,

955
02:18:39,750 --> 02:18:41,665
I checked with the company,

956
02:18:42,791 --> 02:18:45,665
No one knows what happened
to the 5 billion dollars in securities

957
02:18:47,000 --> 02:18:48,999
that De-wei was responsible for!

958
02:18:51,625 --> 02:18:56,665
I also heard that recently

959
02:18:56,750 --> 02:18:59,124
He's hussled up quite a pile of cash.

960
02:18:59,833 --> 02:19:06,957
It's my guess that your house, car, and

961
02:19:08,083 --> 02:19:10,374
Have all been mortgaged off

962
02:19:10,458 --> 02:19:13,374
Of course these are only rumors
and speculation

963
02:19:14,583 --> 02:19:17,957
It'll all take a day or two to confirm

964
02:19:19,833 --> 02:19:25,374
But I have a certain sixth
sense about this kind of thing

965
02:19:28,250 --> 02:19:29,832
He already...

966
02:19:31,250 --> 02:19:35,082
Let me finish. The real news is that

967
02:19:37,500 --> 02:19:39,832
He left the country a few days ago

968
02:19:44,416 --> 02:19:46,749
You mean... that's not De-wei out there?

969
02:19:46,833 --> 02:19:48,999
With no evidence so far

970
02:19:49,083 --> 02:19:50,749
We can't jump to conclusions

971
02:19:50,833 --> 02:19:51,957
Just a minute.

972
02:19:54,625 --> 02:19:56,499
Who told you all of this?

973
02:19:57,416 --> 02:19:59,707
I spoke to a close friend of De-wei's

974
02:20:01,250 --> 02:20:03,832
After you called this morning

975
02:20:05,000 --> 02:20:06,665
Not that "friend" they call Hsiao Hui,
by any chance?

976
02:20:13,583 --> 02:20:15,832
Everything went blank

977
02:20:16,916 --> 02:20:19,374
the moment you hung up

978
02:20:21,375 --> 02:20:23,832
That's not something
that happens to me everyday

979
02:20:33,208 --> 02:20:34,499
Hello,

980
02:20:34,583 --> 02:20:35,874
I'm looking for your general manager

981
02:20:38,833 --> 02:20:41,957
I've been to that beach,
once or twice with De-wei.

982
02:20:42,041 --> 02:20:44,832
In fact, we went there last week

983
02:20:44,916 --> 02:20:46,874
Just before he went to Japan

984
02:20:46,958 --> 02:20:50,999
What, he went to Japan?

985
02:20:53,000 --> 02:20:54,499
You didn't know?

986
02:20:54,583 --> 02:20:56,624
I thought it was you who sent him

987
02:21:01,958 --> 02:21:03,832
What's he doing in Japan?

988
02:21:06,458 --> 02:21:10,665
No wonder I haven't seen him around

989
02:21:12,250 --> 02:21:14,457
He must be back by now

990
02:21:16,208 --> 02:21:18,332
Have they found his body yet?

991
02:21:20,583 --> 02:21:21,582
Not yet

992
02:21:22,708 --> 02:21:25,082
But they found a medicine bottle

993
02:21:25,166 --> 02:21:26,957
Which belongs to De-wei

994
02:21:28,291 --> 02:21:33,832
Jia-li said it was a psychiatrist's prescription

995
02:21:33,916 --> 02:21:38,874
That's what got the police onto her
in the first place

996
02:21:41,125 --> 02:21:42,915
That could just as easily be the bottle

997
02:21:44,000 --> 02:21:46,707
De-wei dropped on the beach last week

998
02:22:12,500 --> 02:22:16,665
Medicine bottle... too much of a coincidence.

999
02:22:19,958 --> 02:22:22,040
If that's really his game...

1000
02:22:22,833 --> 02:22:24,999
What kind of medicine was it?

1001
02:22:25,083 --> 02:22:26,874
The doctor prescribed it...

1002
02:22:29,000 --> 02:22:30,957
An anxiety suppressant.

1003
02:22:39,583 --> 02:22:41,290
You know how De-wei.

1004
02:22:42,750 --> 02:22:46,790
He's been under a lot of pressure from work

1005
02:22:47,791 --> 02:22:49,290
And the way things are at home

1006
02:22:53,166 --> 02:22:56,415
Come on. Come with me to the beach

1007
02:22:57,083 --> 02:22:59,374
We have to let them know about this

1008
02:23:08,375 --> 02:23:10,332
You go ahead

1009
02:23:15,208 --> 02:23:18,082
I'm not going to be dragged back
into that mess!

1010
02:23:18,166 --> 02:23:24,457
How can you refuse to become involved

1011
02:23:28,583 --> 02:23:30,832
When a friend is in this kind of trouble?

1012
02:23:46,208 --> 02:23:47,457
This whole thing with De-wei.

1013
02:23:48,833 --> 02:23:51,415
You've known all along, haven't you?

1014
02:23:52,541 --> 02:23:54,457
But you're not letting on...

1015
02:23:56,291 --> 02:23:59,124
Come to think of it

1016
02:23:59,208 --> 02:24:01,290
Who could possibly know

1017
02:24:01,375 --> 02:24:03,665
All that's gone on between De-wei and you?

1018
02:24:03,750 --> 02:24:06,749
Only you, right?

1019
02:24:09,250 --> 02:24:13,957
There is nothing so big or bleak at work

1020
02:24:14,041 --> 02:24:18,874
send him running off to a psychiatrist,
taking all these medicines

1021
02:24:25,875 --> 02:24:29,082
What other pies have you two
gotten your fingers into?

1022
02:24:31,666 --> 02:24:35,749
What concern is it of mine
if his side interests go bust?

1023
02:24:35,833 --> 02:24:39,499
I'm just helping him out. Is that a crime?

1024
02:24:41,416 --> 02:24:42,915
Helping him out?

1025
02:24:46,583 --> 02:24:48,040
De-wei...

1026
02:24:49,166 --> 02:24:54,290
First you use De-wei
then you try to capitalize on our contracts

1027
02:24:54,375 --> 02:24:57,707
But now you want out.

1028
02:24:57,791 --> 02:25:00,249
You can go it alone, huh?

1029
02:25:01,916 --> 02:25:04,374
Shouting's not going to change things.

1030
02:25:06,166 --> 02:25:07,207
Lin

1031
02:25:10,500 --> 02:25:13,707
I always though you were the sharpest,
coolest of them all

1032
02:25:13,791 --> 02:25:17,249
You say De-wei went to Japan.

1033
02:25:18,125 --> 02:25:19,957
What's he doing in Japan?

1034
02:25:20,625 --> 02:25:22,915
He's not there on any business of mine.

1035
02:25:23,625 --> 02:25:25,165
That's for sure.

1036
02:25:36,083 --> 02:25:39,499
I can find out myself.

1037
02:25:39,583 --> 02:25:41,915
I'm going back to the office now

1038
02:25:43,125 --> 02:25:46,957
I warn you don't ever cross my path again

1039
02:25:54,500 --> 02:25:59,207
Listen sonny

1040
02:25:59,291 --> 02:26:01,665
You are still a baby

1041
02:26:02,291 --> 02:26:06,499
Go on, run to Mommy now

1042
02:26:19,958 --> 02:26:21,665
It wasn't till I got back to the office

1043
02:26:24,083 --> 02:26:26,374
That I learnt about the money.

1044
02:26:29,291 --> 02:26:31,499
The truth is, I feel very close to De-wei

1045
02:26:32,875 --> 02:26:34,957
50 million dollars can buy

1046
02:26:35,041 --> 02:26:37,457
Twenty-odd years of friendship

1047
02:26:40,125 --> 02:26:43,332
Maybe it all went too smoothly
in the beginning

1048
02:26:45,041 --> 02:26:47,165
With business so good

1049
02:26:48,125 --> 02:26:49,915
Somehow De-wei got it into his head

1050
02:26:50,000 --> 02:26:53,249
That making money was a piece of cake

1051
02:26:55,500 --> 02:26:57,165
Perhaps it was my fault

1052
02:27:25,458 --> 02:27:26,249
I've got to go

1053
02:27:35,625 --> 02:27:37,749
I came to such different conclusions

1054
02:27:37,833 --> 02:27:41,957
On my way here.

1055
02:27:42,833 --> 02:27:45,874
At first, I was sure that's him out there

1056
02:27:47,416 --> 02:27:53,415
Then. I got thinking we'd got it all wrong

1057
02:27:55,541 --> 02:27:57,374
That bottle they found...

1058
02:27:57,458 --> 02:28:00,457
Could be the one De-wei
tossed away last week

1059
02:28:01,458 --> 02:28:02,749
And now,

1060
02:28:04,291 --> 02:28:08,249
He might be fooling aournd
somewhere in Taipei

1061
02:28:11,500 --> 02:28:13,665
However, base on my instinct

1062
02:28:14,291 --> 02:28:18,665
Chances like that are low

1063
02:28:19,416 --> 02:28:21,582
But going off to Japan like that

1064
02:28:22,458 --> 02:28:23,999
With all that cash in his pocket,

1065
02:28:26,375 --> 02:28:30,332
He'd been planning that some time now

1066
02:28:30,875 --> 02:28:32,749
Without anybody's knowledge

1067
02:28:34,250 --> 02:28:39,832
He might even have gotten himself
some South American passport

1068
02:28:41,708 --> 02:28:46,082
So you think he's not coming back?

1069
02:28:51,291 --> 02:28:52,790
Let me put it this way

1070
02:28:53,750 --> 02:28:57,624
If it were me, I wouldn't come back

1071
02:28:58,333 --> 02:29:00,457
You know what I mean?

1072
02:29:03,833 --> 02:29:05,332
I could be wrong

1073
02:29:06,000 --> 02:29:14,249
There could be any number of
possible explanations

1074
02:29:16,458 --> 02:29:20,290
Think it over, I have to go

1075
02:29:30,375 --> 02:29:35,040
Think of it this way,
whatever the explanation

1076
02:29:35,125 --> 02:29:39,624
Things end up pretty much the same for you

1077
02:29:39,708 --> 02:29:41,332
Don't they?

1078
02:33:41,208 --> 02:33:44,790
Time is so overwhelming.

1079
02:33:45,750 --> 02:33:47,999
It's frightening

1080
02:33:49,875 --> 02:33:55,499
Papa died, and the clinic's dying too

1081
02:33:55,583 --> 02:34:00,249
The world's left us all behind

1082
02:34:08,458 --> 02:34:13,624
Remember the night you ran away?

1083
02:34:13,708 --> 02:34:17,707
We were talking here, quietly for so long

1084
02:34:17,791 --> 02:34:19,874
Do you remember?

1085
02:34:22,916 --> 02:34:31,957
I heard things aren't going too well
with you and De-wei

1086
02:34:35,500 --> 02:34:39,915
If I had known this is what we'd become

1087
02:34:41,083 --> 02:34:45,749
I would never have come so naively
to talk with you that night

1088
02:34:47,750 --> 02:34:51,832
With one thing and another,
look at the state of things now

1089
02:34:52,958 --> 02:34:57,957
And yet, at last I know now
how to set things right

1090
02:34:58,041 --> 02:35:00,499
Between De-wei and me

1091
02:35:07,208 --> 02:35:08,999
What do you have in mind?

1092
02:35:16,458 --> 02:35:21,124
I must give him my complete trust

1093
02:35:25,541 --> 02:35:27,624
Do you really trust De-wei?

1094
02:35:40,458 --> 02:35:46,624
The one lesson I've learnt best in life

1095
02:35:46,708 --> 02:35:48,457
Is that everything depends on yourself.

1096
02:35:49,791 --> 02:35:53,624
I depent on myself all through my life

1097
02:35:53,708 --> 02:35:57,624
Once, I blindly followed someone else...

1098
02:36:01,583 --> 02:36:04,999
You should never do that

1099
02:36:05,625 --> 02:36:11,790
Jia-li, once I believed too much in Papa

1100
02:36:11,875 --> 02:36:13,707
Look at me now

1101
02:36:13,791 --> 02:36:15,665
Following him

1102
02:36:15,750 --> 02:36:19,749
Following all this that time has left behind

1103
02:36:23,625 --> 02:36:29,582
But if you came to me again
like you did that night you left

1104
02:36:29,666 --> 02:36:32,540
I don't think Id be able to tell you
anything different

1105
02:36:33,583 --> 02:36:39,165
I know it was partly my words
that gave you the courage

1106
02:36:39,250 --> 02:36:42,624
To leave home.

1107
02:36:45,833 --> 02:36:48,999
But my real intention

1108
02:36:49,083 --> 02:36:51,790
Was that you'd learn to rely on yourself

1109
02:36:51,875 --> 02:36:54,957
And come to make your own decisions

1110
02:36:56,916 --> 02:36:58,707
It's my guess

1111
02:36:59,750 --> 02:37:05,040
That you're facing the same kind of
choice again now

1112
02:38:49,083 --> 02:38:53,707
We kept this fragile silence for a long time

1113
02:38:56,625 --> 02:39:01,207
Jia-li's eyes were fixed,
looking out the window and beyond

1114
02:39:02,458 --> 02:39:06,165
She seemed to be quietly surveying
all those distant meJia Senes

1115
02:39:09,250 --> 02:39:11,790
Or perhaps she just didn't want to
look too directly at me

1116
02:39:11,875 --> 02:39:14,624
For fear I'd see how moved she was

1117
02:39:20,500 --> 02:39:22,249
Whatever the reason,

1118
02:39:22,333 --> 02:39:24,124
I felt it would be simply cruel
to press her now

1119
02:39:25,125 --> 02:39:28,915
For the rest of what happened
that day on the beach

1120
02:39:30,166 --> 02:39:32,332
Or what the investigations
might have turned up

1121
02:40:18,625 --> 02:40:20,832
There was an emergency
company meeting that

1122
02:40:20,916 --> 02:40:22,582
Jia-li was called to convene.

1123
02:40:23,291 --> 02:40:25,415
So she had to hurry off.

1124
02:40:26,791 --> 02:40:28,874
It was only when we were saying goodbye

1125
02:40:28,958 --> 02:40:30,499
That I realized

1126
02:40:30,583 --> 02:40:32,999
I still hadn't asked after Jia-sen

1127
02:40:34,458 --> 02:40:38,499
After all, that was my main motive in coming

1128
02:40:40,250 --> 02:40:42,040
It was only then that I learnt

1129
02:40:43,083 --> 02:40:49,165
Jia-sen died of cancer the previous winter

1130
02:40:50,958 --> 02:40:55,249
The family clinic was now
an apartment block

1131
02:40:56,708 --> 02:41:01,499
Jia-li told me how, in his last couple of days

1132
02:41:02,333 --> 02:41:06,040
Jia-sen woke suddenly one day
from deep sleep

1133
02:41:10,916 --> 02:41:18,249
It feels like the two-o'clock sun

1134
02:41:20,916 --> 02:41:25,790
Taking the winter away

1135
02:41:27,333 --> 02:41:31,957
Just like the sunlight in the spring

1136
02:41:35,500 --> 02:41:39,957
When even the birds are singing

1137
02:41:41,375 --> 02:41:46,249
Things seem to be
coming to life all around me

1138
02:41:51,708 --> 02:41:57,332
I want so much to know it all from the start

1139
02:42:25,416 --> 02:42:28,165
What a violent contrast

1140
02:42:30,000 --> 02:42:32,124
Everything here is so cold

1141
02:42:33,541 --> 02:42:38,457
But my heart is hot and beating hard

1142
02:42:40,875 --> 02:42:44,207
With some strange,

1143
02:42:44,291 --> 02:42:47,540
Formless energy against that icy world

1144
02:42:47,625 --> 02:42:50,374
What makes it work so hard I wonder?

1145
02:42:59,083 --> 02:43:04,624
But, I'm happy enough

1146
02:43:06,333 --> 02:43:07,915
Am I wrong?

1147
02:43:12,416 --> 02:43:15,957
You know?
Just keeping this small life going so long

1148
02:43:18,875 --> 02:43:23,540
Is something worth celebrating in itself

1149
02:43:39,791 --> 02:43:43,207
To this day, I still have no idea

1150
02:43:43,291 --> 02:43:46,665
Whether it was De-wei who drowned

1151
02:43:47,583 --> 02:43:53,415
But that's not important anymore

1152
02:43:54,500 --> 02:43:57,749
What really matters is that

1153
02:43:57,833 --> 02:44:00,332
The girl I once knew
has grown into the woman

1154
02:44:07,125 --> 02:44:09,415
Who walked away from

1155
02:44:09,500 --> 02:44:14,040
That day on the beach.
