1
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,493
Serious crimes in the first half year...

2
00:02:19,603 --> 00:02:22,196
were done by the "Big Circle".

3
00:02:22,386 --> 00:02:24,679
The ratio of conviction was low.

4
00:02:24,828 --> 00:02:28,572
The Commissioner
is waiting for your plan.

5
00:02:28,722 --> 00:02:30,705
He has been waiting for 3 months.

6
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:32,436
what do you want to do?

7
00:02:34,649 --> 00:02:36,410
we have to admit one thing.

8
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,463
we need the informers!

9
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:41,385
The "Big Circle" group is cohesive.

10
00:02:41,496 --> 00:02:42,857
They don't trust Hong Kong people.

11
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,019
The informers can't do much!

12
00:02:45,119 --> 00:02:48,342
I have got an idea,
we have to use their own men...

13
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:50,675
for undercover!

14
00:02:51,766 --> 00:02:53,838

00:03:31,757 --> 00:03:32,998
Graduated from Beijing Sports Academy.

00:03:33,118 --> 00:03:35,832
Being a public security in Beijing
starting form 1982.

30
00:03:36,992 --> 00:03:39,686
In April, 1984, all three were arrested
as they headed towards freedom.

31
00:03:39,836 --> 00:03:41,817
They were sent to the
reform-through-labour farm in Chini.

32
00:03:47,043 --> 00:03:49,125
On July 14, 1986,
they fled away from prison.

33
00:03:49,235 --> 00:03:50,597
On July 16, 1986.

34
00:03:50,737 --> 00:03:55,942
They stealthed into HK and were
waiting to be sent back to Mainland.

35
00:04:18,194 --> 00:04:21,638
You are lucky, you have got two choices.

36
00:04:21,788 --> 00:04:25,332
1, to be sent back, 2, work for me!

37
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:31,939
what do you want us to do?

38
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:33,680
Undercover!

39
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:38,896
work for two years and be legalized!

40
00:04:39,006 --> 00:04:41,509
Do you like to stay in HK?

41
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:47,085
Seems that we don't have a choice!

42
00:04:48,065 --> 00:04:50,348
wigs, one each!

43
00:04:50,428 --> 00:04:52,510
An undercover police...

44
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,982
...will help you!

45
00:04:54,152 --> 00:04:56,234
His name is "Biggy"!

46
00:05:17,306 --> 00:05:19,167
To be a police in Hong Kong...

47
00:05:19,287 --> 00:05:21,050
is more difficult
than have a driving license.

48
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:24,323
They only take 30 out of 10,000...

49
00:05:24,603 --> 00:05:26,585
and you need to be out of college.

50
00:05:26,665 --> 00:05:28,217
Fluent English!

51
00:05:28,377 --> 00:05:30,969
Because the instructors speak English.

52
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,703
well, you can't
learn anything in Hong Kong.

53
00:05:34,813 --> 00:05:37,205
Hong Kong is a mixed society.

54
00:05:37,386 --> 00:05:39,048
Even if you spend 8-10 years here.

55
00:05:39,198 --> 00:05:40,969
You only see the surface.

56
00:05:43,973 --> 00:05:46,145
I tell you...

57
00:05:47,417 --> 00:05:50,440
Better get some
cheap electrical appliance,

58
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:54,924
watch some sexual movies,

59
00:05:55,554 --> 00:05:59,198
You'll have a proper pride
when you back to China!

60
00:06:02,522 --> 00:06:07,737
Not sure if I am lucky
with the three of you!

61
00:06:07,877 --> 00:06:09,439
Isn't it!

62
00:06:16,897 --> 00:06:17,828
Big Boss!

63
00:06:17,938 --> 00:06:22,001
wait! I can't bear it!

64
00:06:22,152 --> 00:06:23,924
Just call me Biggy!

65
00:06:24,695 --> 00:06:28,248
Biggy, we are confident to be good.

66
00:06:28,318 --> 00:06:30,500
we want to stay here!

67
00:06:30,781 --> 00:06:32,653
I see! I see!

68
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:39,240
well, you like this
Kentucky Fried Chicken?

69
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:56,186
This is the pager!

70
00:07:05,146 --> 00:07:09,521
It vibrates like frog!

71
00:07:10,572 --> 00:07:12,554
we call it space machine, too.

72
00:07:12,694 --> 00:07:16,558
The wave goes into space
then reflects back!

73
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:21,003
And then "Do..."!

74
00:07:21,993 --> 00:07:25,737
Impossible, it's only a receiver!

75
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:28,310
You know nothing!

76
00:07:28,771 --> 00:07:31,063
I was a radio operator!

77
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:35,517
I can fix your pager!

78
00:07:37,068 --> 00:07:38,410
Your friends?

79
00:07:45,037 --> 00:07:46,899
Self serve meals are "Buffet"!

80
00:07:47,019 --> 00:07:48,151
Buffet?

81
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:50,072
"Buffet" is the English spelling!

82
00:07:50,182 --> 00:07:52,054
The first time I went for a buffet.

83
00:07:52,174 --> 00:07:53,515
I didn't eat for 3 days!

84
00:07:53,666 --> 00:07:56,058
And my stomach was all empty.

85
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,461
Get as much as you like?

86
00:07:58,611 --> 00:08:03,816
Yes! Take it easy, don't be rude!

87
00:08:04,877 --> 00:08:06,019
After I've finished this meal,

88
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:08,140
can I wait and have dinner as well?

89
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:09,742
You can even have supper!

90
00:08:09,853 --> 00:08:11,724
And have breakfast...

91
00:08:11,864 --> 00:08:13,947
in the morning!

92
00:08:20,253 --> 00:08:22,335
You didn't eat in your last life?

93
00:08:22,905 --> 00:08:25,829
I feel hungry without rice!

94
00:08:30,453 --> 00:08:34,007
A lobster over there!
Only one left, take it!

95
00:08:37,981 --> 00:08:39,223
You take it, Big Boss!

96
00:08:39,363 --> 00:08:40,825
I can't have prawns, you have it!

97
00:08:40,974 --> 00:08:42,215
Thanks!

98
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,982
Have you finished looking at it?

99
00:08:58,132 --> 00:08:59,893
The lobster is for decoration!

100
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:03,617
what for putting it there?
wanna scare me?

101
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:28,723
The hill out there is Cheung Chow.

102
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:31,436
The place for stolen goods.

103
00:09:31,997 --> 00:09:34,589
The turnover is around $50M!

104
00:09:40,696 --> 00:09:41,636
Do you know him?

105
00:09:41,816 --> 00:09:44,929
No, but we say hello!

106
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,812
You are smart!

107
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:48,524
He has got a lot of information.

108
00:09:48,713 --> 00:09:51,407
Try to talk to him!

109
00:09:51,627 --> 00:09:53,188
You give the order, boss!

110
00:09:53,448 --> 00:09:55,211
Stop kidding, Biggy!

111
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:56,782
we are good friends!

112
00:09:56,962 --> 00:10:00,075
Don't mention friendship!

113
00:10:00,265 --> 00:10:02,248
I am only your temp commander.

114
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:05,761
I have a suggestion, commander

115
00:10:05,901 --> 00:10:08,404
Everyone should have a pistol.

116
00:10:11,236 --> 00:10:15,200
Undercovers don't have guns!

117
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:17,343
It's dangerous to work in H.K.!

118
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,715
Don't worry, I know how to get the guns!

119
00:10:20,306 --> 00:10:23,439
You are criminals,
don't try to get the guns.

120
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,702
Don't try to get the guns.

121
00:10:25,812 --> 00:10:29,145
Hire from the guns smugglers!

122
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:59,046
Two.45 government,
fifty thousand dollars each.

123
00:10:59,156 --> 00:11:01,979
One.44 Magnum, twenty thousand dollars!

124
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,002
10 bullets each.

125
00:11:05,252 --> 00:11:06,283
It's too expensive!

126
00:11:06,474 --> 00:11:08,866
Hay, you have these three pistols!

127
00:11:08,976 --> 00:11:10,958
You can make
a few hundred dollars in a second!

128
00:11:11,139 --> 00:11:13,010
It wouldn't be too expensive?

129
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:16,704
He is reliable!

130
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:18,956
Pay if you want it!

131
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:21,359
Hok Kwan, pay!

132
00:11:28,296 --> 00:11:30,578
Your usual rule!

133
00:11:31,469 --> 00:11:33,021
Say it again!

134
00:11:33,612 --> 00:11:35,914
Right, the 30 rounds of bullets?

135
00:11:35,984 --> 00:11:38,055
I get them for you!

136
00:11:44,383 --> 00:11:45,834
Negro Tong?

137
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:49,527
Negro Tong!

138
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:55,544
Biggy, I have waited for 3 years!

139
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:56,865
Don't move!

140
00:11:57,115 --> 00:11:59,408
what, upset I didn't visit you in jail?

141
00:11:59,448 --> 00:12:01,320
Rubbish, last time you helped me.

142
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,302
I ended up in jail!

143
00:12:03,552 --> 00:12:05,634
Bastard, betrayed me!

144
00:12:05,854 --> 00:12:07,627
Me, bastard? I betrayed you?

145
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,608
The police got me too!

146
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:13,753
I broke my ribs as well!

147
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,906
I wanna sincere!

148
00:12:17,096 --> 00:12:20,740
You would spend 3 more years.
If I told the cops!

149
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,843
what do you mean, wanna frame me!

150
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:26,065
It's no use how you say it!

151
00:12:26,256 --> 00:12:27,807
I wanna kill you today.

152
00:12:33,523 --> 00:12:35,505
Look at these three pistols.

153
00:12:35,645 --> 00:12:38,678
Go...over there!

154
00:12:45,045 --> 00:12:46,396
Don't move!

155
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:51,902
Tong!

156
00:12:56,706 --> 00:12:57,737
Chick Lai?

157
00:12:57,898 --> 00:12:59,450
I came here two months ago.

158
00:13:00,251 --> 00:13:01,091
which prison camp?

159
00:13:01,271 --> 00:13:02,202
Kin Luen!

160
00:13:02,382 --> 00:13:03,213
who was in-charge?

161
00:13:03,354 --> 00:13:04,815
Uncle Pong, the man from San Tung!

162
00:13:05,766 --> 00:13:07,628
He really is a pimp!

163
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:10,731
He is still alive. That bastard!

164
00:13:10,901 --> 00:13:12,993
Tong, in Chick Lai 7 years ago.

165
00:13:13,143 --> 00:13:15,436
You were the head of the 5-1 riot!

166
00:13:15,535 --> 00:13:18,770
The old ones always talk about you!

167
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,481
You have heard about my name?

168
00:13:20,621 --> 00:13:22,603
Yes, you were famous!

169
00:13:24,655 --> 00:13:27,057
He is your friend?

170
00:13:27,127 --> 00:13:29,200
Yes, we are old friends!

171
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:32,834
Shut up! who the hell is your old friend.

172
00:13:32,904 --> 00:13:36,547
Don't forget you are our temp commander!

173
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:40,341
You are an informer, you bastard!

174
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:45,716
Give me back the money!

175
00:13:46,658 --> 00:13:49,161
You said we have it all!

176
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:50,201
Give it to me!

177
00:13:59,852 --> 00:14:03,495
Don't spoil our friendship
because of the bastard.

178
00:14:03,716 --> 00:14:05,907
You tell me one thing!

179
00:14:06,258 --> 00:14:07,499
we didn't see anything.

180
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:10,042
we are here to swim!

181
00:14:47,991 --> 00:14:50,493
I want your life.

182
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:54,958
I am sorry, I forgot my trunks!

183
00:14:55,088 --> 00:14:56,350
what trunks?

184
00:15:33,868 --> 00:15:37,942
Don't, please! Let me go,
take the pistol!

185
00:15:38,012 --> 00:15:39,673
I have seen nothing.

186
00:15:39,784 --> 00:15:41,866
I...I go to swim!

187
00:15:44,489 --> 00:15:47,612
No...

188
00:15:48,873 --> 00:15:53,567
Betrayed me?

189
00:16:07,743 --> 00:16:08,563
Thanks.

190
00:16:08,713 --> 00:16:12,157
Come over, my left ear can't hear!

191
00:16:12,228 --> 00:16:15,351
It shouldn't, cover your right ear.

192
00:16:15,611 --> 00:16:18,724
Hok Kwan, speak loudly on his left.

193
00:16:18,814 --> 00:16:20,886
- See if he can hear!
- Yes.

194
00:16:30,897 --> 00:16:32,548
I can't hear a thing!

195
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:35,811
Come closer, try to speak loudly!

196
00:16:38,924 --> 00:16:42,468
You bastard, fool me! I have enough!

197
00:16:42,828 --> 00:16:45,121
I heard you told
Negro Tong the other day...

198
00:16:45,431 --> 00:16:47,934
"Shut up, I am not your friend!"

199
00:16:48,054 --> 00:16:52,428
I thought I would finish!

200
00:16:52,849 --> 00:16:55,151
I thought you leave me alone!

201
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:58,624
You fool, don't be narrow minded!

202
00:16:58,765 --> 00:17:02,408
we are comrades!

203
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:04,231
Tung!

204
00:17:04,411 --> 00:17:07,113
I met my good friend
in the army and his sister.

205
00:17:07,544 --> 00:17:08,795
Beautiful girl?

206
00:17:09,175 --> 00:17:11,158
He saved my life in the war.

207
00:17:11,338 --> 00:17:14,361
He invited me for dinner,
I hope I can go!

208
00:17:14,431 --> 00:17:15,572
when did he come?

209
00:17:15,692 --> 00:17:17,243
He got the permission five years ago.

210
00:17:20,487 --> 00:17:23,410
Be careful, don't expose yourself.

211
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:02,079
Inspector Ching!

212
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:06,384
The crimes under the property of HK...

213
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,306
is really amazing!

214
00:18:08,497 --> 00:18:12,561
we have a "Self-kidnapping" case!

215
00:18:13,161 --> 00:18:15,754
A jewelry shop owner rubbed his own shop.

216
00:18:15,974 --> 00:18:19,518
And tried to get the compensation!

217
00:18:20,009 --> 00:18:22,311
His partners got away with the jewelry.

218
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:24,562
And blackmailed the owner.

219
00:18:25,093 --> 00:18:26,865
Through Biggy...

220
00:18:26,976 --> 00:18:31,870
The owner asked us
to get the jewelleries back.

221
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:34,593
Boss, this is the deposit!

222
00:18:36,935 --> 00:18:39,438
Hok Kwan, check it.

223
00:18:56,676 --> 00:19:00,099
Sorry, we're late!

224
00:19:08,779 --> 00:19:09,919
Let me kiss you!

225
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:13,433
Let's change.

226
00:19:15,225 --> 00:19:16,356
No...!

227
00:19:18,768 --> 00:19:20,319
Excuse me!

228
00:19:23,433 --> 00:19:24,894
Your boyfriend?

229
00:19:28,138 --> 00:19:30,531
He is my cousin!

230
00:19:30,611 --> 00:19:33,203
He always comes here
cause he likes dancing!

231
00:19:33,944 --> 00:19:35,306
I thought you were his.

232
00:19:35,445 --> 00:19:36,586
what did you say?

233
00:19:36,657 --> 00:19:38,639
I am sorry!

234
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:43,233
I know what you are thinking.

235
00:19:43,313 --> 00:19:45,596
Don't listen to what people say!

236
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:49,120
Not every girl goes out
with the guests here.

237
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:53,154
There are bad ones in a good family too!

238
00:19:53,865 --> 00:19:56,147
Every job is the same here in H.K.!

239
00:19:56,227 --> 00:19:59,450
Some of the stars "work" for money!

240
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,982
It all depends!

241
00:20:01,132 --> 00:20:03,114
I do behave!

242
00:20:03,745 --> 00:20:07,819
I don't really like money!

243
00:20:10,141 --> 00:20:12,223
Am I too mean?

244
00:20:12,514 --> 00:20:15,226
No, I respect you!

245
00:20:15,407 --> 00:20:16,757
Thanks!

246
00:20:59,051 --> 00:21:00,823
I want to see Siu Hing.

247
00:21:02,645 --> 00:21:05,238
what?

248
00:21:05,398 --> 00:21:07,380
- Dear Hing!
- Is that you?

249
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,983
I am camel, Siu Hing is my superior!

250
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:19,202
Hing, that bastard is coming.

251
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,697
I am Li Ho Tung, from China.

252
00:21:24,847 --> 00:21:27,250
I represent Boss Yeung!

253
00:21:28,781 --> 00:21:30,243
who are you talking to?

254
00:21:30,664 --> 00:21:32,125
who is he talking too?

255
00:21:32,715 --> 00:21:34,077
what has he got in hand?

256
00:21:36,509 --> 00:21:38,492
That Yeung bastard, sent a fool over.

257
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:39,873
what does it mean?

258
00:21:41,315 --> 00:21:43,817
This means he doesn't respect you!

259
00:21:44,097 --> 00:21:45,980
I want you to hand over your stuff,

260
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:49,343
to us in two days' time!

261
00:21:58,291 --> 00:22:00,695
That's my paging number!

262
00:22:00,845 --> 00:22:04,478
Think it over,
contact me in these two days!

263
00:22:17,541 --> 00:22:20,985
Do you know who you are talking to?

264
00:22:21,135 --> 00:22:25,510
My status in T.S.T.
is the same as a mayor!

265
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:29,283
Everyone has to salute at me!

266
00:22:29,414 --> 00:22:31,076
Only I can give the order.

267
00:22:31,226 --> 00:22:33,628
You can't tell me what to do.

268
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:38,383
- Do you understand?
- I understand!

269
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:48,243
It's my mum's birthday tomorrow,
we'll wait.

270
00:22:48,353 --> 00:22:49,605
You are lucky!

271
00:22:49,775 --> 00:22:52,898
Tell Mr. Yeung not to negotiate anymore.

272
00:22:53,339 --> 00:22:54,680
I have to celebrate my mum's birthday.

273
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,982
Then I will put his mum to sleep,
understand?

274
00:22:58,004 --> 00:22:59,464
I understand!

275
00:23:01,617 --> 00:23:03,078
Stupid!

276
00:23:03,318 --> 00:23:06,962
I don't wanna see you
in T.S.T. anymore. Understand?

277
00:23:07,112 --> 00:23:08,354
Understand!

278
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,269
what are you looking at?

279
00:23:13,449 --> 00:23:16,162
If I see you again, I chop yours off!

280
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:17,693
Let's go!

281
00:23:45,792 --> 00:23:50,067
The target tonight
is to insult Siu Hing publicly!

282
00:23:50,217 --> 00:23:51,347
If we succeed.

283
00:23:51,418 --> 00:23:54,981
we can build up our fame instantly!

284
00:23:55,011 --> 00:23:58,035
And joint the Hong Kong underground.

285
00:23:58,215 --> 00:24:01,238
They have more people,
so they are better off.

286
00:24:01,418 --> 00:24:04,011
But they have their weak point too.

287
00:24:04,381 --> 00:24:07,825
They are not ready to fight!

288
00:24:08,235 --> 00:24:10,217
And because Siu Hing is selfish.

289
00:24:10,367 --> 00:24:13,591
People may not help him!

290
00:24:14,091 --> 00:24:17,534
That's Hong Kong people,

291
00:24:17,745 --> 00:24:22,019
and we have to attack fast!

292
00:24:22,129 --> 00:24:24,002
and retreat quickly!

293
00:24:24,152 --> 00:24:28,426
The whole operation
is no more than 5 minutes!

294
00:24:28,526 --> 00:24:29,567
I understand!

295
00:24:29,857 --> 00:24:35,073
Great, a military operation!

296
00:24:35,844 --> 00:24:40,848
we don't need outside support!

297
00:24:41,129 --> 00:24:43,841
we get drawn easily!

298
00:24:44,542 --> 00:24:48,616
Main point attack!

299
00:24:48,827 --> 00:24:51,120
Four of us only better play Mahjong.

300
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:53,311
we will surely die!

301
00:24:53,632 --> 00:24:56,034
Your job is "Two Electrics".

302
00:24:56,344 --> 00:24:57,596
Give me orders!

303
00:24:57,696 --> 00:25:00,519
No, I sincerely ask you to join in.

304
00:25:00,629 --> 00:25:04,373
I didn't say no!

305
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:07,516
But tell me.

306
00:25:07,556 --> 00:25:10,158
what "Two Electrics" is?

307
00:25:10,268 --> 00:25:14,132
That's the phone and the switch!

308
00:25:14,303 --> 00:25:15,865
why ask me to do such silly things?

309
00:25:16,335 --> 00:25:20,700
Because it's safe for you!

310
00:25:23,292 --> 00:25:25,464
- You two sneak in first!
- Yes!

311
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:43,824
Boss Kwan, good on you!

312
00:25:43,864 --> 00:25:44,694
Congratulations!

313
00:25:44,804 --> 00:25:47,827
Boss Shing, Tang Sir,
thank you for you coming!

314
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,521
You get lost!

315
00:25:53,263 --> 00:25:54,615
I said before seven,
now it's eight already!

316
00:25:54,695 --> 00:25:55,935
what time is it?

317
00:25:56,045 --> 00:25:57,387
I thought you got run over!

318
00:25:57,537 --> 00:25:58,899
Mum's back hurt when coming!

319
00:25:59,038 --> 00:26:00,500
She had to take the drugs!

320
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:04,124
The guests were having prawn noodles!

321
00:26:04,254 --> 00:26:05,806
I earn nothing today!

322
00:26:05,966 --> 00:26:08,989
I said no celebrations before!

323
00:26:09,069 --> 00:26:11,241
why talk to me that loud!

324
00:26:11,391 --> 00:26:13,584
The clothes are for corpse only!

325
00:26:13,794 --> 00:26:15,045
That brings bad luck!

326
00:26:15,185 --> 00:26:16,547
Stop that!

327
00:26:16,677 --> 00:26:18,659
Damn it, respect me will you!

328
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,312
Go to hell!

329
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:34,115
No.1!

330
00:26:55,187 --> 00:26:58,730
Everybody, it's Mrs. Ko's birthday today.

331
00:26:58,871 --> 00:27:00,952
Let's celebrate by singing!

332
00:27:01,072 --> 00:27:01,894
Go to hell!

333
00:27:01,964 --> 00:27:05,517
Hing, your call, it's from Mr. Yeung!

334
00:27:15,547 --> 00:27:32,565
Happy birthday to you...!

335
00:27:36,569 --> 00:27:46,379
Happy birthday to you...!

336
00:27:52,134 --> 00:27:53,586
Get down on your knees!

337
00:27:57,490 --> 00:28:00,723
Give me the signal!

338
00:28:01,354 --> 00:28:02,596
Hit the drum!

339
00:28:12,215 --> 00:28:14,088
Come, let's go!

340
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,241
You chicken!

341
00:28:19,252 --> 00:28:22,696
The whole place is under our control!

342
00:28:23,947 --> 00:28:27,801
well you don't have to use the pistols!

343
00:28:27,952 --> 00:28:30,544
Put down your gun, let's talk!

344
00:28:40,794 --> 00:28:43,187
Get down on your knees!

345
00:28:47,722 --> 00:28:50,835
Everybody we've to solve our problem!

346
00:28:51,025 --> 00:28:53,428
And hope that I get the respect.

347
00:28:53,838 --> 00:28:55,620
Please stay out of it?

348
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,223
- Understand?
- Understand...

349
00:28:58,263 --> 00:28:59,514
Tell us your sin!

350
00:28:59,624 --> 00:29:01,606
I was wrong to take people's goods.

351
00:29:01,746 --> 00:29:03,208
I promise to hand them back!

352
00:29:07,902 --> 00:29:09,054
Read it loud!

353
00:29:10,796 --> 00:29:12,467
Me, Siu Hing is a pimp.

354
00:29:12,607 --> 00:29:15,310
It's not my mum's birthday,
I wanna rip off!

355
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,483
I am bad to my family!

356
00:29:17,663 --> 00:29:19,735
I am a beast!

357
00:29:25,241 --> 00:29:26,381
Louder!

358
00:29:28,203 --> 00:29:30,706
I deserve what I should!

359
00:29:30,846 --> 00:29:33,438
If not, you chop me!

360
00:29:36,522 --> 00:29:37,773
Retreat!

361
00:29:37,813 --> 00:29:39,054
Hit the drum!

362
00:29:55,842 --> 00:29:57,613
Let's go!

363
00:30:00,506 --> 00:30:01,968
Please stay out, let's go!

364
00:30:02,839 --> 00:30:04,600
- Are you alright?
- You betrayer!

365
00:30:06,673 --> 00:30:08,014
Mum, a cup of tea!

366
00:30:08,134 --> 00:30:10,207
Let's drink!

367
00:30:14,531 --> 00:30:16,933
I'm very happy!

368
00:30:21,699 --> 00:30:40,488
All working people had
a debt written in blood and tears.

369
00:30:40,678 --> 00:30:47,004
They want to take revenge!

370
00:30:47,044 --> 00:30:53,410
They wanna avenge!

371
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:02,600
Finish the power, release the people.

372
00:31:02,771 --> 00:31:11,228
To be the master, and see the sun again!

373
00:31:13,221 --> 00:31:14,573
Good!

374
00:31:15,343 --> 00:31:18,467
we need one more person to play Mahjong!

375
00:31:22,271 --> 00:31:24,252
You match with my sister.

376
00:31:28,086 --> 00:31:29,638
Come, meet my good friend!

377
00:31:29,859 --> 00:31:32,361
we were like brothers in war!

378
00:31:32,541 --> 00:31:33,792
King San!

379
00:31:33,832 --> 00:31:36,115
- Nick name "wolf"!
- Boss Yeung!

380
00:31:36,475 --> 00:31:37,505
Just call me "wolf"!

381
00:31:37,656 --> 00:31:39,318
- Li Ming Pal!
- How are you?

382
00:31:39,508 --> 00:31:40,970
- Boss Pal!
- Come, sit down!

383
00:31:45,033 --> 00:31:47,957
we done well at Tung wong!

384
00:31:48,207 --> 00:31:49,448
How did you know?

385
00:31:49,558 --> 00:31:51,961
we got rich in few years time.

386
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:53,562
Guess what we do?

387
00:31:53,672 --> 00:31:55,745
Friend's friend told me that.

388
00:31:55,995 --> 00:31:57,136
Let's play Mahjong!

389
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:23,903
You suspect their l.D. since Sunday?

390
00:32:31,852 --> 00:32:35,405
why tell me after 3 days?

391
00:32:37,877 --> 00:32:41,942
Don't forget that we are cops!

392
00:32:42,062 --> 00:32:44,235
No sympathy on criminals!

393
00:32:44,355 --> 00:32:46,637
Ah Fu and I were in 169 squad.

394
00:32:47,348 --> 00:32:49,419
we stayed together.

395
00:32:49,569 --> 00:32:51,642
He may be a criminal now.

396
00:32:51,772 --> 00:32:54,275
He is upsetting the society.

397
00:32:54,445 --> 00:32:56,217
Don't be too passionate!

398
00:32:56,327 --> 00:32:57,678
when we were fighting
with the Vietkung in 79.

399
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:01,051
I was hit by a bomb!

400
00:33:01,262 --> 00:33:02,934
And Ah Fu was shot too.

401
00:33:03,184 --> 00:33:06,297
But he carried me for four miles!

402
00:33:06,417 --> 00:33:08,048
And he had saved my life!

403
00:33:08,088 --> 00:33:11,732
My job is to charge him today!

404
00:33:11,982 --> 00:33:14,065
I feel guilty.

405
00:33:14,175 --> 00:33:17,408
I didn't get to sleep lately?

406
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:20,582
People look down on the men from China,

407
00:33:20,732 --> 00:33:22,384
all because of people like Ah Fu.

408
00:33:22,504 --> 00:33:24,265
They commit crimes here!

409
00:33:24,385 --> 00:33:26,978
They become thieves here!

410
00:33:27,138 --> 00:33:30,042
They should be kept in jail!

411
00:33:30,192 --> 00:33:33,946
Shut up, father is dead?

412
00:33:34,096 --> 00:33:35,557
Shut up your dirty mouth!

413
00:33:35,657 --> 00:33:37,730
You can never be a gentleman.

414
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:53,095
I am sorry, my dad is in the hospital!

415
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:57,309
I hope that he will recover!

416
00:33:58,911 --> 00:34:01,313
Boss, your shrimp dumplings are good!

417
00:34:02,214 --> 00:34:04,506
Did your dad teach you?

418
00:34:04,616 --> 00:34:07,120
Yes, my dad is from Shan Tung!

419
00:34:08,410 --> 00:34:11,634
To have shrimp dumplings now
is meaningful!

420
00:34:11,854 --> 00:34:13,416
we can pay our respect to your dad!

421
00:34:20,323 --> 00:34:24,597
King San, you said you like my dumplings.

422
00:34:24,978 --> 00:34:29,142
I had spent a whole day, do have some!

423
00:34:29,683 --> 00:34:31,664
Come, it's cold!

424
00:34:43,016 --> 00:34:47,090
It's a chance Cheung Chow
asks for our help!

425
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,193
He has been a sales representative!

426
00:34:49,283 --> 00:34:51,355
Try to press him to tell us!

427
00:34:51,435 --> 00:34:53,416
Then we will have a lot of cases!

428
00:34:55,369 --> 00:34:58,592
Please come in!

429
00:34:58,712 --> 00:35:01,215
Cheung Chow!

430
00:35:01,355 --> 00:35:05,109
Thanks for coming!

431
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:38,663
The deal was $350,000!

432
00:35:38,853 --> 00:35:43,438
The Kwong brothers said I lied!

433
00:35:43,618 --> 00:35:46,120
Obviously they put pressure on us?

434
00:35:46,301 --> 00:35:47,853
They don't keep their words!

435
00:35:48,033 --> 00:35:49,804
That's why I hate "Big Circles"!

436
00:35:49,874 --> 00:35:52,067
No, I mean the people!

437
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:55,441
That spoils your image!

438
00:36:02,558 --> 00:36:06,412
Some one is fooling around.

439
00:36:13,829 --> 00:36:14,861
The Kwong brothers are very mysterious.

440
00:36:15,011 --> 00:36:17,303
They seldom fix up
with other men from China.

441
00:36:17,423 --> 00:36:20,446
The usual place they go
is the Mahjong house.

442
00:36:20,516 --> 00:36:24,590
They play for high stakes,
minimum is $500.

443
00:36:24,830 --> 00:36:27,122
The source of money is unknown.

444
00:36:27,263 --> 00:36:29,776
It's the 1st time
they wanna trade with Cheung Chow.

445
00:36:29,906 --> 00:36:31,998
How many people will go together?

446
00:36:32,588 --> 00:36:35,091
The four of them make up an army!

447
00:36:35,271 --> 00:36:37,674
The Kwongs won't be
afraid of Cheung Chow.

448
00:36:37,884 --> 00:36:41,007
Don't know who will
stand for Cheung Chow!

449
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:43,580
So they will have their guns.

450
00:36:46,202 --> 00:36:49,016
Pal, keep calm!

451
00:36:49,716 --> 00:36:53,469
what? I am not an executor!

452
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,652
I am afraid your mind
is filled with killings,

453
00:36:55,782 --> 00:36:59,106
and no passion!

454
00:36:59,466 --> 00:37:01,338
I have the mid-night show tickets!

455
00:37:07,575 --> 00:37:10,698
Remember to pick us up in this area!

456
00:37:10,848 --> 00:37:13,240
I know, you have said a hundred times!

457
00:37:14,041 --> 00:37:16,033
I have got the mid-night show tickets!

458
00:37:16,203 --> 00:37:18,786
Right, the four Kwongs
are really brothers?

459
00:37:18,886 --> 00:37:20,247
Yes!

460
00:37:23,001 --> 00:37:24,241
why?

461
00:37:27,765 --> 00:37:28,906
How is it?

462
00:37:29,016 --> 00:37:32,250
I had grabbed a rubber
called Kwong in Kong Sai!

463
00:37:32,460 --> 00:37:34,543
But he should have two brothers.

464
00:37:34,723 --> 00:37:36,083
was it that co-incidental?

465
00:37:36,224 --> 00:37:38,626
The data have no trace
that they are in H.K.

466
00:37:38,966 --> 00:37:40,739
I don't think so!

467
00:37:43,181 --> 00:37:45,163
Heung Tung! King San!
Hok Kwan! Come on...!

468
00:37:46,804 --> 00:37:48,787
- Come in!
- Please!

469
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,002
Please come in!

470
00:37:55,233 --> 00:37:56,996
No body here!

471
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,216
what would you like to drink?

472
00:37:58,326 --> 00:37:59,678
Po Lee, Sau Mei, Jasmine, all of them!

473
00:37:59,748 --> 00:38:01,000
Right!

474
00:38:05,734 --> 00:38:06,985
This way please!

475
00:38:09,017 --> 00:38:11,610
- Damn, it really is he!
- what shall we do?

476
00:38:12,631 --> 00:38:15,554
Be alert, get ready at any time!

477
00:38:17,015 --> 00:38:21,190
Remember, never expose our identity!

478
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:22,792
Come in, please!

479
00:38:23,493 --> 00:38:25,995
The bosses have gone to call you!

480
00:38:29,589 --> 00:38:33,132
Come...please!

481
00:38:34,214 --> 00:38:37,857
This is Boss Hoi, Boss Hok,
Boss Ming, Boss Chu!

482
00:38:37,977 --> 00:38:40,269
Tung! San! King!

483
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:41,651
we are of the same origin.

484
00:38:42,222 --> 00:38:46,385
we can feel free! Alright?

485
00:38:46,566 --> 00:38:48,228
- Hoi, what would you like?
- Lung Chan!

486
00:38:48,448 --> 00:38:50,950
Lung Chan, get me a bottle of Lung Chan!

487
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:51,992
Yes!

488
00:38:56,596 --> 00:38:58,668
They just came out?

489
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:00,871
They are from Check Lai.

490
00:39:01,021 --> 00:39:03,724
They had no alternative, so they left.

491
00:39:03,944 --> 00:39:06,857
The fight at Tung wong restaurant
was done by them!

492
00:39:07,037 --> 00:39:08,809
Tung, you look familiar!

493
00:39:12,682 --> 00:39:14,344
where did we meet before?

494
00:39:15,185 --> 00:39:17,588
I can remember even just seeing once!

495
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:19,570
Have you ever stayed
in Kwong Sai Kwai Lam?

496
00:39:19,710 --> 00:39:23,154
No chance,
I stayed in Canton all the time!

497
00:39:24,515 --> 00:39:26,687
How come you stayed there all the time?

498
00:39:30,882 --> 00:39:32,343
what did you say?

499
00:39:32,553 --> 00:39:35,156
You should know
the language of Kwong Sai!

500
00:39:35,626 --> 00:39:38,530
Pals, are you talking
business or kidding?

501
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:40,061
Can you tell me?

502
00:39:40,181 --> 00:39:42,574
You had worked at
the Kwai Lam Security Dept?

503
00:39:44,696 --> 00:39:46,157
It's you, can't escape!

504
00:39:46,308 --> 00:39:49,220
You have gun wound on your arm,
what does it mean?

505
00:40:23,616 --> 00:40:26,839
I told you that
politeness can make money already!

506
00:40:52,375 --> 00:40:53,837
- He asks me to look for you!
- How is he?

507
00:40:54,007 --> 00:40:55,358
He won't get through!

508
00:41:00,934 --> 00:41:03,536
Ah Kong...I am Leung!

509
00:41:03,727 --> 00:41:04,968
what do you want to tell me?

510
00:41:05,349 --> 00:41:07,851
who did this?
I will finish them for you!

511
00:41:08,031 --> 00:41:14,397
Kwong Sai Security office,
"Big Circle" undercover!

512
00:41:15,269 --> 00:41:17,150
Ah Kong!

513
00:41:27,742 --> 00:41:29,092
Hide the instrument!

514
00:41:29,273 --> 00:41:31,865
Call the police,
say he came here himself.

515
00:41:31,985 --> 00:41:35,099
I have not been here, understand?

516
00:41:35,289 --> 00:41:36,650
Understand!

517
00:41:40,684 --> 00:41:42,977
FUCK! FUCK!

518
00:41:45,029 --> 00:41:47,221
what's that meaning?

519
00:41:53,778 --> 00:41:58,362
The headline-4 got killed in the public!

520
00:41:58,472 --> 00:41:59,934
Trouble this time!

521
00:42:00,104 --> 00:42:03,137
Sir, they discovered that
Heung Tung is a cop.

522
00:42:03,207 --> 00:42:05,190
If their identity got revealed.

523
00:42:05,290 --> 00:42:06,851
They can't carry out their duty anymore.

524
00:42:07,001 --> 00:42:08,143
They have to go back to China!

525
00:42:08,223 --> 00:42:10,305
Shut up, none of your business here!

526
00:42:10,965 --> 00:42:13,368
First in Tung wong Rest.
It's the second time.

527
00:42:13,468 --> 00:42:14,619
So what if they recognize you?

528
00:42:14,769 --> 00:42:17,272
A cop back there,
a thief here is the same.

529
00:42:17,482 --> 00:42:19,875
Many cops turn to be thieves here!

530
00:42:19,985 --> 00:42:22,377
You are too nervous!

531
00:42:22,457 --> 00:42:23,709
It's impossible!

532
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,902
China cops will never be thieves.

533
00:42:27,052 --> 00:42:28,513
They have pistols!

534
00:42:28,653 --> 00:42:30,636
Can't we self-defend ourselves?

535
00:42:31,127 --> 00:42:32,477
we're a policeman!

536
00:42:32,587 --> 00:42:35,401
It's our job to fight crime,
we have to be tough!

537
00:42:35,501 --> 00:42:37,903
Here is Hong Kong,
it's a place of law and order.

538
00:42:38,053 --> 00:42:40,035
we can't just kill the thieves.

539
00:42:40,135 --> 00:42:42,208
You are only a sneaker!

540
00:42:42,398 --> 00:42:45,631
I sneak in only for freedom.

541
00:42:45,781 --> 00:42:47,543
Please do respect me!

542
00:42:47,653 --> 00:42:50,166
Shut up, or I put you in jail!

543
00:42:50,306 --> 00:42:52,488
And send you back
to Mainland China. Fuck.

544
00:42:57,193 --> 00:43:00,316
Yours friends could be
the ones we look for!

545
00:43:00,436 --> 00:43:03,239
They killed 2 guards and a pedestrian!

546
00:43:03,389 --> 00:43:05,572
Hurting four policemen,
keep an eye on them!

547
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,824
Catch them alive!

548
00:43:17,004 --> 00:43:18,555
Sir, how is Cheung Chow!

549
00:43:18,675 --> 00:43:20,327
I hide him in an isolated room.

550
00:43:20,477 --> 00:43:23,510
He has nightmares everyday!

551
00:43:29,606 --> 00:43:30,537
Let's go!

552
00:43:31,689 --> 00:43:33,049
Let's go to have some bear!

553
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,733
Beer! Not bear! FUCK!

554
00:43:51,598 --> 00:43:53,581
will Ah Fu come back?

555
00:43:55,322 --> 00:43:57,825
He is missing for a few days.

556
00:43:58,706 --> 00:43:59,837
So hot!

557
00:44:01,589 --> 00:44:06,394
The air-cond. is no good,
you want some beer?

558
00:44:07,024 --> 00:44:08,687
I get it myself!

559
00:44:19,167 --> 00:44:20,529
So hot!

560
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:24,553
Don't be shy, you are old enough!

561
00:44:26,374 --> 00:44:29,708
Put on your clothes,
I got to talk to you!

562
00:44:41,029 --> 00:44:44,152
Actually we can talk about anything!

563
00:44:44,583 --> 00:44:47,506
It wasn't time to let Ah Fu tell you!

564
00:44:47,996 --> 00:44:51,020
I think you can guess!

565
00:44:53,492 --> 00:44:56,195
we plan to rob the bank!

566
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:58,468
There will be around $7.0M.

567
00:44:58,647 --> 00:45:00,930
I hope you two can help me!

568
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,431
Some beer!

569
00:45:09,369 --> 00:45:10,920
why look for us suddenly?

570
00:45:11,350 --> 00:45:14,674
well, you are cruel enough!

571
00:45:14,794 --> 00:45:17,496
And because of Ah Fu, we can trust you!

572
00:45:17,687 --> 00:45:22,692
Our old partners are gone!

573
00:45:22,902 --> 00:45:24,885
And they can't have the share!

574
00:46:05,476 --> 00:46:07,127
God, come again!

575
00:46:07,598 --> 00:46:13,655
Madam, help, madam...Come again!

576
00:46:14,665 --> 00:46:15,697
It's O.K., Mariana!

577
00:46:15,917 --> 00:46:18,509
Him, my darling, O.K.!

578
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:20,792
OK, I see!

579
00:46:20,792 --> 00:46:21,933
That team of people?

580
00:46:22,083 --> 00:46:24,065
who knows who did it?

581
00:46:24,276 --> 00:46:26,978
There was no uniform, no writing!

582
00:46:27,158 --> 00:46:28,720
The "Big Circle"!

583
00:46:29,841 --> 00:46:31,303
Because of your Mariana!

584
00:46:31,443 --> 00:46:33,424
You let people in so easily!

585
00:46:33,805 --> 00:46:37,148
I was drying my hair when they rushed in.

586
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:40,522
Did they insult you?

587
00:46:41,953 --> 00:46:43,415
No!

588
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:47,450
But hit me, ask me where
Cheung Chow was hiding.

589
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:52,394
Look at my fingers!

590
00:46:52,634 --> 00:46:53,886
Oh no!

591
00:46:57,449 --> 00:47:01,193
I don't care, they have taken anything!

592
00:47:03,365 --> 00:47:04,617
YOU STUPlD!

593
00:47:05,278 --> 00:47:08,190
I was going to kill myself!

594
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:11,333
Stop that darling, don't cry!

595
00:47:12,345 --> 00:47:13,807
How much did you lose?

596
00:47:15,308 --> 00:47:18,951
Altogether is more than $200,000!

597
00:47:19,512 --> 00:47:21,184
That much?

598
00:47:27,590 --> 00:47:28,732
where are you going?

599
00:47:28,802 --> 00:47:32,666
Anywhere, just to leave this place!

600
00:47:32,816 --> 00:47:36,779
How can I face them, they trust me!

601
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:38,241
Let me think!

602
00:47:38,381 --> 00:47:40,984
I can protect you, don't go!

603
00:47:41,304 --> 00:47:43,076
Can you protect me for my whole life?

604
00:47:43,146 --> 00:47:45,549
Those people warned me
of telling the truth.

605
00:47:45,689 --> 00:47:47,461
Or they will hurt me on my face!

606
00:47:48,051 --> 00:47:50,764
I know you were involved
in Cheung Chow's case.

607
00:47:50,945 --> 00:47:53,867
I won't betray you!

608
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:58,352
Because I can't help loving you!

609
00:47:59,893 --> 00:48:01,255
Forget it, Hok Kwan!

610
00:48:01,425 --> 00:48:03,817
we better break up!

611
00:48:04,658 --> 00:48:08,002
Darling, don't leave me alone.

612
00:48:08,142 --> 00:48:10,224
I will die without you!

613
00:48:10,365 --> 00:48:13,708
My heart breaks without seeing you!

614
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:16,140
But shorten the pain!

615
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,722
It won't be good if we stay together.

616
00:48:18,863 --> 00:48:21,576
You don't have a steady income!

617
00:48:21,745 --> 00:48:25,300
And I worry about your life!

618
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:27,081
It's only my fancy!

619
00:48:27,081 --> 00:48:30,104
I will go with you if I had $350,000!

620
00:48:30,244 --> 00:48:34,098
we go to Hawaii!

621
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:36,051
And start all over again!

622
00:48:36,331 --> 00:48:38,002
$350,000 is not a problem!

623
00:48:38,112 --> 00:48:39,885
But I can't leave!

624
00:48:39,955 --> 00:48:41,105
Don't you have a passport?

625
00:48:41,145 --> 00:48:43,739
I can get you a forge passport!

626
00:48:43,929 --> 00:48:45,690
Then we can go anywhere!

627
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:47,192
It's no use having the passport!

628
00:48:47,302 --> 00:48:48,233
why?

629
00:48:48,413 --> 00:48:50,816
I can't tell you!

630
00:48:50,956 --> 00:48:53,358
So you lie to me!

631
00:48:53,428 --> 00:48:55,820
You only play with me!

632
00:48:55,930 --> 00:48:57,392
I can swear...!

633
00:48:57,502 --> 00:48:59,374
I really want to marry you!

634
00:48:59,524 --> 00:49:02,328
Go to hell, I won't trust you!

635
00:49:03,939 --> 00:49:06,442
O.K. I tell you!

636
00:49:06,622 --> 00:49:08,273
But you have to keep to secret!

637
00:49:08,364 --> 00:49:10,756
I am an informer!

638
00:49:10,866 --> 00:49:13,990
The police wants us to be undercovers!

639
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:15,110
what?

640
00:49:27,443 --> 00:49:29,625
what's wrong?

641
00:49:30,076 --> 00:49:31,337
Nothing!

642
00:49:43,129 --> 00:49:45,742
I didn't know that you love your parents!

643
00:49:46,272 --> 00:49:47,935
My mum died early!

644
00:49:48,115 --> 00:49:49,776
I live with my dad!

645
00:49:49,956 --> 00:49:53,500
He is proud of me as a cop!

646
00:49:55,362 --> 00:49:59,326
He is a good teacher!

647
00:50:00,257 --> 00:50:04,942
This time I sneaked into Hong Kong!

648
00:50:05,412 --> 00:50:08,015
He was questioned real hard.

649
00:50:08,365 --> 00:50:11,808
So, if my dad died because of me.

650
00:50:12,549 --> 00:50:14,831
what do I do?

651
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:24,962
It looks like raining!

652
00:50:26,163 --> 00:50:28,236
Nothing I can do!

653
00:50:31,098 --> 00:50:33,601
Let's talk business!

654
00:50:34,482 --> 00:50:38,546
who is behind the four brothers?

655
00:50:38,936 --> 00:50:40,398
Don't know?

656
00:50:41,198 --> 00:50:45,263
It was said that I was responsible!

657
00:50:45,783 --> 00:50:47,666
It gets on me!

658
00:50:48,257 --> 00:50:51,179
But nobody will know you did it!

659
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:55,264
I will hide away in the New Territories!

660
00:50:56,334 --> 00:50:57,586
For how long?

661
00:50:59,017 --> 00:51:00,368
Hard to say!

662
00:51:00,518 --> 00:51:03,222
I wait till things calm down!

663
00:51:04,272 --> 00:51:07,916
I am used to this way of living!

664
00:51:08,587 --> 00:51:09,828
Sorry!

665
00:51:10,259 --> 00:51:13,482
I now realize your way of life!

666
00:51:16,665 --> 00:51:19,167
I am tough, I survive!

667
00:51:20,599 --> 00:51:22,671
I haven't been to wars.

668
00:51:23,662 --> 00:51:25,124
But look at me!

669
00:51:25,935 --> 00:51:31,340
I have stitches allover my body!

670
00:51:33,273 --> 00:51:36,916
Some by thieves, some by police.

671
00:51:38,598 --> 00:51:40,370
To do my job it's been 1 3 years.

672
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:43,142
Don't know what I look like!

673
00:51:43,643 --> 00:51:47,387
An informer will die sooner or later!

674
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:51,261
The cops think that I am a thief.

675
00:51:51,691 --> 00:51:55,135
The thief may think that I am a cop!

676
00:51:55,996 --> 00:51:59,229
I worry all the time!

677
00:51:59,939 --> 00:52:04,003
You can stay on for two years and change.

678
00:52:04,734 --> 00:52:07,557
As for me?

679
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:12,282
I have no friends and my wife is gone!

680
00:52:13,093 --> 00:52:18,619
To be pessimistic!

681
00:52:18,698 --> 00:52:20,981
I won't have the national salute!

682
00:52:21,792 --> 00:52:23,153
what do you think?

683
00:52:24,054 --> 00:52:25,416
You say it!

684
00:52:28,549 --> 00:52:30,320
Damn it!

685
00:52:31,582 --> 00:52:33,034
Do you understand?

686
00:52:35,055 --> 00:52:38,078
Yes, I understand!

687
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:40,441
Do you know!

688
00:52:40,521 --> 00:52:43,745
But you were quite smart!

689
00:52:43,825 --> 00:52:45,596
I know you look down on me!

690
00:52:46,127 --> 00:52:51,963
You said that I was a worthless coward.

691
00:52:52,083 --> 00:52:54,786
Right? Don't deny that!

692
00:52:56,297 --> 00:52:59,100
I felt that you were bad!

693
00:52:59,451 --> 00:53:00,491
And now?

694
00:53:00,641 --> 00:53:05,016
But you are a real pal!

695
00:53:05,206 --> 00:53:07,598
I know, you don't have to say!

696
00:53:22,844 --> 00:53:26,078
I will retire after this year.

697
00:53:27,890 --> 00:53:34,056
I have saved more than $100,000!

698
00:53:35,237 --> 00:53:41,084
I can run my own business!

699
00:53:42,134 --> 00:53:45,678
This is for you!

700
00:53:45,748 --> 00:53:47,109
For me?

701
00:53:48,301 --> 00:53:49,752
Really?

702
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:02,245
Your dumplings are good!

703
00:54:02,636 --> 00:54:04,827
Give me some more other time!

704
00:54:04,998 --> 00:54:07,601
How many can you have? 50?

705
00:54:07,860 --> 00:54:09,623
80!

706
00:56:32,870 --> 00:56:37,354
Kill me...!

707
00:56:39,166 --> 00:56:42,609
Kill me, I don't know anything!

708
00:56:48,676 --> 00:56:51,789
Bastard, something wrong here?

709
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:56,184
I give you a chance, tell me who did it!

710
00:56:56,404 --> 00:56:59,737
I'll fulfill your wish to be a hero!

711
00:57:00,308 --> 00:57:06,554
I...I don't know!

712
00:57:45,204 --> 00:57:48,748
Let me punch him and let the rats...

713
00:57:48,858 --> 00:57:50,929
get into his mouth.

714
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:52,922
Then he will talk!

715
00:58:08,878 --> 00:58:10,950
O.K. have you got back your memories!

716
00:58:11,100 --> 00:58:13,172
I want you to tell me a few names!

717
00:58:23,803 --> 00:58:25,265
Damn it!

718
00:58:25,685 --> 00:58:27,457
I'll kill you!

719
00:58:27,497 --> 00:58:29,049
You want to be a hero!

720
00:58:29,830 --> 00:58:32,432
Is it worthwhile?

721
00:58:33,583 --> 00:58:36,396
They have saved my life.

722
00:58:36,476 --> 00:58:39,920
I have put myself to death already.

723
00:58:40,020 --> 00:58:41,381
How is it?

724
00:58:41,482 --> 00:58:44,605
He won't tell, kill him!

725
00:58:45,626 --> 00:58:46,656
You have got guts!

726
00:59:39,691 --> 00:59:40,942
Tung!

727
01:00:07,159 --> 01:00:09,662
- what? Is he die?
- Yes.

728
01:01:12,657 --> 01:01:14,018
I tell you all!

729
01:01:14,158 --> 01:01:16,560
Biggy was actually killed by you!

730
01:01:17,291 --> 01:01:19,173
I don't want promotion because of you!

731
01:01:19,313 --> 01:01:21,595
I'll be fired soon!

732
01:01:22,096 --> 01:01:24,799
The commissioners
wants you under custody.

733
01:01:24,949 --> 01:01:27,352
The legal dept. wants to prosecute you.

734
01:01:27,522 --> 01:01:31,276
If no prosecution,
they send you back in 24 hrs.

735
01:01:31,496 --> 01:01:32,847
- Sir!
- Stop.

736
01:01:32,987 --> 01:01:35,489
I am useless!
I can't control the three of you.

737
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:37,892
we have finished many cases!

738
01:01:37,963 --> 01:01:39,423
So I ask for amnesty!

739
01:01:39,574 --> 01:01:42,798
Go to fix up wolf's team,
there could be a chance.

740
01:01:42,947 --> 01:01:44,499
How are they now?

741
01:01:44,649 --> 01:01:48,814
They ask us to be
ready the job in 24 hours.

742
01:01:48,904 --> 01:01:51,075
- The same bank you said before?
- Yes!

743
01:01:51,266 --> 01:01:52,507
Do as you are told!

744
01:01:55,410 --> 01:01:57,813
And your dad is dead!

745
01:01:58,894 --> 01:02:01,397
There was a telex at your place...

746
01:02:01,507 --> 01:02:04,620
Sorry!

747
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:11,277
Sir, was there any word from my father?

748
01:02:11,377 --> 01:02:15,661
I don't know! Sorry!

749
01:02:28,484 --> 01:02:31,177
Damn it, we work hard for him!

750
01:02:31,398 --> 01:02:35,041
Now he send us back, what does it mean?

751
01:02:35,442 --> 01:02:36,682
You say it!

752
01:02:37,674 --> 01:02:39,655
Tung, Mr. Ching is cunning!

753
01:02:39,785 --> 01:02:41,668
we stop Ah Fu's operation!

754
01:02:42,779 --> 01:02:44,020
No!

755
01:02:46,303 --> 01:02:50,787
we have started, we have to insist on!

756
01:02:52,779 --> 01:02:55,281
I don't know what for!

757
01:02:55,832 --> 01:02:58,545
He has no mercy, your dad just died!

758
01:02:58,975 --> 01:03:00,958
You betrayed your friend.

759
01:03:01,088 --> 01:03:03,590
why? why finish the cases?

760
01:03:03,670 --> 01:03:05,443
There are 20,000 police in H.K.

761
01:03:05,483 --> 01:03:07,354
why we have to do the investigation?

762
01:03:07,494 --> 01:03:08,746
Just for staying here?

763
01:03:08,856 --> 01:03:11,769
Mr. Ching has got our weak point.

764
01:03:11,949 --> 01:03:14,772
Even if we worked for 2 years,
he won't let us go.

765
01:03:14,872 --> 01:03:16,644
He will force us to carry on.

766
01:03:16,824 --> 01:03:18,495
And he gets promoted!

767
01:03:18,666 --> 01:03:20,127
And we have more enemies.

768
01:03:20,308 --> 01:03:22,590
we will end up like Biggy!

769
01:03:22,990 --> 01:03:24,972
I'm afraid!

770
01:03:26,263 --> 01:03:29,697
I dreamt we went to Hawaii!

771
01:03:29,777 --> 01:03:33,741
And sun bathing on the beach!

772
01:03:33,881 --> 01:03:35,753
In pairs!

773
01:03:36,183 --> 01:03:39,617
Me and Diana, King San with Hung!

774
01:03:39,767 --> 01:03:42,060
You won't believe it Tung.

775
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,802
Your girl has good figure!

776
01:03:44,912 --> 01:03:48,676
Hok Kwan, we can't go anywhere
without a passport.

777
01:03:54,732 --> 01:03:56,394
I was dreaming!

778
01:03:57,756 --> 01:04:00,058
we have nowhere to go!

779
01:05:11,211 --> 01:05:12,563
I am sorry, miss!

780
01:05:19,139 --> 01:05:21,641
Don't worry, it's O.K.!

781
01:05:24,965 --> 01:05:25,986
Thanks!

782
01:05:26,176 --> 01:05:27,428
Let's go!

783
01:05:32,412 --> 01:05:33,444
Immigration?

784
01:05:33,554 --> 01:05:35,216
I wanna report a Chinese male,

785
01:05:35,336 --> 01:05:38,359
using a Li Tai Chung passport...

786
01:05:38,459 --> 01:05:40,341
He will take flight BC-100!

787
01:05:40,481 --> 01:05:43,404
He is 5'4", short hair, big eyes!

788
01:05:51,172 --> 01:05:52,103
The money has been exchanged?

789
01:05:52,213 --> 01:05:53,044
It's in the bag!

790
01:05:53,224 --> 01:05:54,165
would the customs look at immigration?

791
01:05:54,336 --> 01:05:56,938
H.K. has no financial control!

792
01:05:57,128 --> 01:05:58,370
Let's go!

793
01:06:00,251 --> 01:06:02,014
what's upsetting?

794
01:06:02,064 --> 01:06:03,835
No, I am happy.

795
01:06:05,407 --> 01:06:06,768
You don't miss me?

796
01:06:15,567 --> 01:06:18,169
Don't worry, it's O.K.!

797
01:06:18,280 --> 01:06:20,883
Let's go!

798
01:06:25,797 --> 01:06:28,310
You line up first, I go to get the drug!

799
01:06:33,175 --> 01:06:34,947
will be a change your passport!

800
01:06:43,556 --> 01:06:45,638
Mister. Can I have your passport?

801
01:06:50,413 --> 01:06:53,436
Mister. Please come with me,
we want to talk with you!

802
01:07:08,662 --> 01:07:09,793
Don't go!

803
01:07:27,972 --> 01:07:30,564
My heart beats fast, go quick!

804
01:07:30,754 --> 01:07:32,526
Don't worry, it's O.K.!

805
01:07:32,627 --> 01:07:36,190
He knew the end at To Kwa wan!

806
01:07:54,048 --> 01:07:55,289
I'll kill you!

807
01:08:22,827 --> 01:08:25,930
Get away! Get away quickly!

808
01:08:26,942 --> 01:08:28,283
Oh no!

809
01:08:44,860 --> 01:08:45,801
what are you doing?

810
01:08:45,911 --> 01:08:47,784
You want to die!

811
01:09:04,811 --> 01:09:06,272
- You take a look over there!
- No!

812
01:09:06,373 --> 01:09:08,254
And you check the taxi station!

813
01:09:14,971 --> 01:09:16,222
Tung!

814
01:09:26,042 --> 01:09:27,704
He's take the money gone?

815
01:09:34,291 --> 01:09:36,793
Hok Kwan, open the door!

816
01:09:47,865 --> 01:09:50,578
The money is evidence,
what do you want to do?

817
01:09:51,489 --> 01:09:54,402
I thought Diana really loved me!

818
01:09:54,522 --> 01:09:56,283
She said she would follow me!

819
01:09:56,433 --> 01:09:58,416
why did you come back?

820
01:09:58,586 --> 01:10:00,357
She deceived me!

821
01:10:01,449 --> 01:10:05,613
She has another man,
she betrayed me at the airport.

822
01:10:05,974 --> 01:10:09,197
She told the immigration
that I had a forged passport!

823
01:10:09,757 --> 01:10:11,218
I managed to escaped!

824
01:10:12,410 --> 01:10:14,172
And fought with the police.

825
01:10:14,572 --> 01:10:18,116
I snatched a gun and hurt the man.

826
01:10:18,255 --> 01:10:20,238
How dare you!

827
01:10:20,769 --> 01:10:22,951
Cheung Chow's case is under proceeding.

828
01:10:23,121 --> 01:10:25,424
we have to return the money in two days.

829
01:10:25,534 --> 01:10:26,774
The money is now lost.

830
01:10:27,545 --> 01:10:29,948
And you made a mess in the airport.

831
01:10:31,520 --> 01:10:34,022
we will end up in jail?

832
01:10:34,472 --> 01:10:35,724
- Tung!
- Go away!

833
01:10:36,845 --> 01:10:38,717
I know I was wrong, I am sorry!

834
01:10:38,797 --> 01:10:40,559
I don't deserve surviving!

835
01:10:40,669 --> 01:10:43,382
I die for my wrong doings!

836
01:10:44,053 --> 01:10:45,193
Go away!

837
01:10:45,233 --> 01:10:48,256
It doesn't help
even if you shoot yourself!

838
01:10:50,349 --> 01:10:54,844
when we came here,
we said live and die together.

839
01:10:55,044 --> 01:10:58,077
You kill yourself
at this critical moment.

840
01:10:58,147 --> 01:11:00,129
That proves you are a chicken!

841
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:02,932
You are irresponsible...

842
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:06,636
you should be sorry to me and King San!

843
01:11:06,846 --> 01:11:12,792
If you have the guts, pull the trigger!

844
01:11:15,665 --> 01:11:19,258
Those ballroom-girl,
do they know about you?

845
01:11:19,388 --> 01:11:21,461
I have told her!

846
01:11:24,524 --> 01:11:25,786
Hok Kwan!

847
01:11:29,679 --> 01:11:30,930
Ah Fu!

848
01:11:31,771 --> 01:11:33,123
Get in!

849
01:11:38,037 --> 01:11:39,399
Ah Fu, you've come here at night!

850
01:11:40,611 --> 01:11:42,272
Are you ready to get rich?

851
01:11:50,611 --> 01:11:52,592
we gather here and do it tomorrow!

852
01:11:52,692 --> 01:11:54,355
we have a meeting tonight.

853
01:11:54,755 --> 01:11:56,827
Cheer up, let's go!

854
01:12:13,404 --> 01:12:15,806
It's here, come in!

855
01:12:23,604 --> 01:12:27,348
Leave your pager here, and stay here!

856
01:12:31,082 --> 01:12:32,123
Come, sit!

857
01:12:36,208 --> 01:12:37,869
The few million dollars are over there.

858
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:40,933
we go over after seeing the armor truck.

859
01:12:41,082 --> 01:12:43,365
we can see if anything goes wrong.

860
01:12:43,615 --> 01:12:46,958
No traffic jam, good spot!

861
01:12:54,446 --> 01:12:57,259
I'll tell you the details!

862
01:12:57,329 --> 01:12:58,570
Relax!

863
01:13:01,403 --> 01:13:02,865
Come, sit!

864
01:13:04,817 --> 01:13:05,748
$100 or $200?

865
01:13:05,898 --> 01:13:07,559
Yes!

866
01:13:17,310 --> 01:13:18,671
what are you doing here?

867
01:13:18,811 --> 01:13:20,162
To cook!

868
01:13:21,314 --> 01:13:24,237
Be careful tomorrow for your first time!

869
01:13:24,867 --> 01:13:27,059
My brother will take care of you!

870
01:13:28,731 --> 01:13:30,182
I'll be careful!

871
01:13:30,923 --> 01:13:32,906
whenever my brother commits a crime.

872
01:13:33,216 --> 01:13:35,919
I can't sleep for weeks!

873
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:37,950
I have to worry about you too.

874
01:13:38,721 --> 01:13:42,575
Promise me you'll be alright!

875
01:14:08,241 --> 01:14:10,645
Bad smell, go to hell...

876
01:14:11,135 --> 01:14:12,476
Is he alright?

877
01:14:13,007 --> 01:14:14,148
O.K.!

878
01:14:17,151 --> 01:14:18,613
Something wrong with you?

879
01:14:19,373 --> 01:14:21,976
He's like this every time!

880
01:14:22,196 --> 01:14:24,378
To be ready for the fight!

881
01:14:25,019 --> 01:14:26,570
It's O.K. if we had one less.

882
01:14:27,281 --> 01:14:30,504
Don't worry, it will be O.K.!

883
01:14:30,694 --> 01:14:34,438
He is very brutal doing his job!

884
01:14:35,039 --> 01:14:38,062
I do whenever my brother tells me!

885
01:14:38,172 --> 01:14:41,406
If he wants me dead, I'll kill myself!

886
01:14:42,417 --> 01:14:46,030
See, he is bloody mad, Pak Man!

887
01:14:47,462 --> 01:14:49,344
Nine blocks already, be careful!

888
01:14:53,768 --> 01:14:55,541
Can't contact him!

889
01:14:55,721 --> 01:15:02,708
They have joined the gang!

890
01:15:02,888 --> 01:15:04,139
And they will go along with the project.

891
01:15:04,279 --> 01:15:07,723
we carry out our plan before dawn!

892
01:15:08,734 --> 01:15:11,766
The three Kin-Luen bastards!

893
01:15:11,897 --> 01:15:14,400
will be trapped with the gang tomorrow.

894
01:15:14,580 --> 01:15:15,931
If there was exchange of fire.

895
01:15:16,081 --> 01:15:19,104
would they be hurt too?

896
01:15:19,214 --> 01:15:21,717
An hour ago, the special task force!

897
01:15:21,757 --> 01:15:23,419
Have got their pictures!

898
01:15:23,559 --> 01:15:27,843
But it's hard to say if it is chaotic!

899
01:15:32,018 --> 01:15:35,661
I want to talk to you alone!

900
01:15:36,062 --> 01:15:39,295
About the incidence
at the airport tonight.

901
01:15:39,365 --> 01:15:41,967
It was done by Hok Kwan!

902
01:15:42,358 --> 01:15:46,222
Your understand was a total failure.

903
01:15:46,893 --> 01:15:51,568
In the past year,
they had commit a lot of serious crime.

904
01:15:51,758 --> 01:15:54,260
In other words, if it got revealed.

905
01:15:55,692 --> 01:15:59,766
The police will be attacked by the media.

906
01:15:59,807 --> 01:16:03,871
we don't have our future anymore.

907
01:16:04,011 --> 01:16:08,605
Lucky only you and I know about it!

908
01:16:08,715 --> 01:16:13,090
If they all get killed tomorrow!

909
01:16:13,821 --> 01:16:16,743
Then nothing has ever happened!

910
01:16:17,594 --> 01:16:20,187
Do you know what I mean?

911
01:17:07,095 --> 01:17:08,226
Yours!

912
01:17:13,281 --> 01:17:14,733
They are from America!

913
01:17:14,994 --> 01:17:17,165
I made this out of copper!

914
01:17:17,906 --> 01:17:19,467
It is a little bit heavy.

915
01:17:19,578 --> 01:17:23,022
Normal pistols can't make a hole on it.

916
01:17:24,563 --> 01:17:26,646
Come, King San, look!

917
01:17:27,205 --> 01:17:28,667
I don't trust this!

918
01:17:28,837 --> 01:17:31,019
You are freshman, you wear it!

919
01:18:41,492 --> 01:18:43,153
Something wrong with him!

920
01:19:21,833 --> 01:19:23,295
Miss, we're the police.

921
01:19:23,395 --> 01:19:25,687
Can we stay on the balcony!

922
01:19:29,071 --> 01:19:30,312
Nobody's home!

923
01:19:30,402 --> 01:19:31,643
we're special task force!

924
01:19:31,713 --> 01:19:32,544
we wanna stay on the balcony...

925
01:19:32,724 --> 01:19:34,186
to keep an eye on the bank!

926
01:19:35,437 --> 01:19:37,630
My mum is out, can't let you in!

927
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:41,043
I wish that you can help, it's fatal!

928
01:19:41,734 --> 01:19:43,816
I am a woman, not convenient!

929
01:19:44,286 --> 01:19:46,268
Next door would be O.K.

930
01:19:54,657 --> 01:19:56,729
Impossible!

931
01:20:02,835 --> 01:20:04,818
A police was attacked at the airport.

932
01:20:04,858 --> 01:20:06,519
A suspect with forged passport.

933
01:20:06,699 --> 01:20:09,923
Snatched the police pistol
and hurting a man.

934
01:20:10,533 --> 01:20:13,977
Our reporter has
interviewed the two victims.

935
01:20:14,317 --> 01:20:17,240
It's him, he has robbed my money!

936
01:20:17,310 --> 01:20:19,713
He is a cop from China!

937
01:20:19,783 --> 01:20:21,244
He said he was a Chinese policeman.

938
01:20:22,155 --> 01:20:23,507
He said he was a Chinese policeman.

939
01:20:23,657 --> 01:20:24,898
Now working as an informer.

940
01:20:25,038 --> 01:20:25,979
what did the police respond?

941
01:20:26,089 --> 01:20:28,381
They deny it, but I don't believe them!

942
01:20:28,451 --> 01:20:30,334
The police is not trying to catch him.

943
01:20:30,514 --> 01:20:33,207
He is at large
and can always threaten me!

944
01:20:33,327 --> 01:20:35,198
I want 24 hours protection
from the police.

945
01:20:36,630 --> 01:20:37,882
Police from China?

946
01:20:37,992 --> 01:20:39,763
You killed the Kwong brothers.

947
01:20:39,943 --> 01:20:41,926
Hok Kwan, they have the lighter.

948
01:20:42,026 --> 01:20:43,797
They killed Biggy!

949
01:21:05,980 --> 01:21:07,642
Open the door...what's happening inside?

950
01:21:14,779 --> 01:21:18,012
Tung, are you alright?

951
01:21:18,163 --> 01:21:19,404
Look Hok Kwan!

952
01:21:22,167 --> 01:21:24,248
Send someone to search the top!

953
01:22:58,445 --> 01:22:59,386
Hok Kwan!

954
01:23:21,239 --> 01:23:22,600
Ah Fu...!

955
01:23:22,741 --> 01:23:25,773
You betrayed me!

956
01:23:35,344 --> 01:23:42,020
King San...!

957
01:24:24,523 --> 01:24:25,465
Don't move!

958
01:25:09,150 --> 01:25:13,834
The ones in the alley,
you have 3 minutes!

959
01:25:13,994 --> 01:25:16,698
Drop your weapons or I forced out!

960
01:25:27,328 --> 01:25:29,310
Sir, they are coming out!

961
01:25:32,403 --> 01:25:34,386
Don't shoot!

962
01:25:34,526 --> 01:25:37,759
I'll kill him whoever fires!

963
01:25:40,451 --> 01:25:41,583
I am Hok Kwan!

964
01:25:41,663 --> 01:25:44,265
Is Mr. Ching here? I wanna see him!

965
01:25:48,940 --> 01:25:50,703
Move back, did you hear me?

966
01:25:50,823 --> 01:25:52,374
Or we die together!

967
01:26:01,443 --> 01:26:02,574
Fire!

968
01:26:15,147 --> 01:26:16,499
Mr. Ching.

969
01:26:25,247 --> 01:26:28,471
Don't come over, move back 20 yards.

970
01:26:32,384 --> 01:26:35,088
Move back 20 yards, it's an order!

971
01:26:38,441 --> 01:26:39,683
You betrayed us?

972
01:26:39,753 --> 01:26:41,835
If you fire, you get shot!

973
01:26:41,985 --> 01:26:43,347
I don't care!

974
01:26:46,099 --> 01:26:47,340
It's no use killing me!

975
01:26:47,460 --> 01:26:49,012
It's not my idea to kill Hok Kwan.

976
01:26:49,152 --> 01:26:51,865
It was an order, I didn't agree.

977
01:26:51,945 --> 01:26:54,017
I had argued with them,
but they wouldn't listen.

978
01:26:54,178 --> 01:26:57,721
Your were a soldier,
you should understand.

979
01:26:57,901 --> 01:26:59,242
The lower ranks
have to obey all the time.

980
01:26:59,392 --> 01:27:03,026
And Hok Kwan made such a big mess...

981
01:27:03,186 --> 01:27:05,689
he was surely sentenced to death.

982
01:27:06,110 --> 01:27:09,233
To sacrifice him,
I've got an alternative.

983
01:27:09,804 --> 01:27:11,675
Then I can help you!

984
01:27:11,855 --> 01:27:15,709
Li Heung Tung, trust me!
I promise you be alright!

985
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:19,894
That's an order, but don't have to obey!

986
01:27:20,384 --> 01:27:22,887
If I was ordered to kill a kid!

987
01:27:23,057 --> 01:27:24,938
I won't obey!

988
01:27:25,329 --> 01:27:27,622
I am conscientious!

989
01:27:28,353 --> 01:27:32,107
You gave the order,
so you are responsible!

990
01:27:32,287 --> 01:27:34,879
Li Heung Tung, do you want to stay?

991
01:27:35,039 --> 01:27:37,962
Don't lie to me, I won't trust you!

992
01:27:38,032 --> 01:27:42,307
what did we say when sneaking in...

993
01:27:42,487 --> 01:27:44,669
to live and die together!

994
01:27:45,620 --> 01:27:46,551
Goodbye!
