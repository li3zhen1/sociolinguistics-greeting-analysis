三个月了

00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,210
我们要承认一个事实
we have to admit one thing.

10
00:02:36,210 --> 00:02:38,240
其实破案要依赖线报
we need the informers!

不信任香港人

00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:44,720
我们布落那些线起不到作用
The informers can't do much!

14
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,250
我现在的撒手锏就是以毒攻毒
I have got an idea, we have to use their own men...

你们落到来香港根本学不到什么东西

去金冠戏院看几场性变态的外语片

你说呀！
Isn't it!

68
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,800
阿大大哥

69
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,110
打住，不好哥前哥后，我受不起

怎样，我介绍这只U.S.A.的家乡鸡

75
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,880
吃不吃得惯呀？

76
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:56,100
Call机，就是你们叫做的传呼机
This is the pager!

00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,320
Call机又叫太空机

给这部机接收了就 “嘟…”
And then "Do..."!

82
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:22,920
不可能的
Impossible, it's only a receiver!

83
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:25,530
这个是很简单的电波接收仪器

84

You know nothing!

85

我以前当过无线电通讯兵
I was a radio operator!

“Buffet” 是自助餐的英语叫法

我老爸第一次带我来食Buffet的时候

清了肠胃才来吃餐饱的

95
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,440

Get as much as you like?

00:07:58,440 --> 00:07:59,460
当然！
Yes! Take it easy, don't be rude!

00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:03,570
不要急不及待，失礼人了！

如果吃完这餐

坐到肚饿，又吃夜晚那餐行不行呢？

你前世未吃过饭吗？

只龙虾要来陈设的！

111
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:03,100
陈设又放在这里，坑人吗！

00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,470
不识，礼貌上打个招呼吧了！

不好说笑了，大大！
Stop kidding, Biggy!

打住，不要老友前老友后呀！

00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:08,190
我想申请每人一支枪
Everyone should have a pistol.

127
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:15,060
香港做卧底好惨的，无枪的！
Undercovers don't have guns!

128
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:17,310
但是我们的工作好危险的！
It's dangerous to work in H.K.!

129
00:10:17,310 --> 00:10:19,780
你镇定些，我有路买的嘛！

130
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:23,180
不过你们记着，你们现在是大圈

131
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:25,380
你们不应该申请
Don't try to get the guns.

132
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,920
应该用非法的手段来弄到手的
Hire from the guns smugglers!

133
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:59,010
两支航空曲，每支蚊半

价钱高了些！
It's too expensive!

137
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:09,090
大哥，你们拿着这三支生财工具

138
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,320
一单买卖就赚几十蚊啦！

139
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,130
点会高啊？

140
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,120
跛张的价钱公道的
He is reliable!

141
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,460
不会骗你的老板

142
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,630
满意就付款吧！
Pay if you want it!

143
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:21,270
学军，给他！
Hok Kwan, pay!

144
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:30,170
你那份照规矩哦！
Your usual rule!

145
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,780
慢慢计啦！
Say it again!

146

是了，那三十发子弹呢？
Right, the 30 rounds of bullets?

147
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:37,750
我入去拿给你吧！
I get them for you!

148
00:11:44,430 --> 00:11:45,450
黑鬼唐？
Negro Tong?

149
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,190
黑鬼唐！
Negro Tong!

150
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,470
大大，我等今天等了三年了

别动呀！

152
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,270
干什么呀，嬲我无拜你山吗？

153
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:01,350
废话，上次找你出货
Rubbish, last time you helped me.

154
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,070
一转身就给警察拉了
I ended up in jail!

155
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:05,470
契弟，出卖我？
Bastard, betrayed me!

156
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,710
我契弟，我出卖你？
Me, bastard? I betrayed you?

157
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,680
我也给警察拉了！
The police got me too!

158
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:13,520
肋骨都打断几条
I broke my ribs as well!

159
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:16,820
我大大出来混是说义气的
I wanna sincere!

160
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:18,860
如果我和那些警察合作
You would spend 3 more years. If I told the cops!

161
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,630
你最少坐多三、四年呀！

162
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,300
你现在这样说法，即是硬生生冤枉我啦！
what do you mean, wanna frame me!

163
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:25,890
你说到会飞都无用
It's no use how you say it!

164
00:12:26,370 --> 00:12:27,530
我今日就要杀你
I wanna kill you today.

165
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,050
看看这三个人什么来头
Look at these three pistols.

166
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:38,640
去…去那边…行！
Go...over there!

167
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:45,820
别动呀！
Don't move!

168
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:51,120
唐哥！
Tong!

169
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:57,470
赤泥？
Chick Lai?

170
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,270
两个月前逃出来的
I came here two months ago.

171
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,240
赤泥在那里？
which prison camp?

172
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,270
建联！
Kin Luen!

173
00:13:02,270 --> 00:13:03,140
谁是监头？
who was in-charge?

174
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:04,840
山东佬，邦爷！
Uncle Pong, the man from San Tung!

175
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,280
正宗屎忽鬼来的
He really is a pimp!

176
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:10,780
还未死吗？那个臭家伙！
He is still alive. That bastard!

177
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:13,050
唐哥，七年前是赤泥
Tong, in Chick Lai 7 years ago.

178
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:15,390
领导五一大暴动那个黑鬼唐就是你？
You were the head of the 5-1 riot!

179
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,720
我们在里面
The old ones always talk about you!

180
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,660
时常都听到一些前辈提起你的

181
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,460
你们听过我个名？
You have heard about my name?

182
00:13:20,460 --> 00:13:22,550
是呀，唐哥你好出名的！
Yes, you were famous!

183
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,000
这个反骨仔是你的老朋友吗？
He is your friend?

184
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,190
是呀，我们是老友来的
Yes, we are old friends!

185
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,940
打住，不要老友前老友后
Shut up! who the hell is your old friend.

186
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,610
你呀！不过是我们的
Don't forget you are our temp commander!

187
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,660
临时买枪指导员吧了

188
00:13:36,910 --> 00:13:39,900
你这个打靶，原来你是做反骨仔的
You are an informer, you bastard!

189
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,310
那些钱给回他们！
Give me back the money!

190
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:49,250
不是嘛唐哥，那我有什么好处啊？
You said we have it all!

191
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:49,980
拿来！
Give it to me!

192
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:03,300
大家大圈的，无谓为了些桂枝仔伤感情
Don't spoil our friendship because of the bastard.

193
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:05,690
这家伙的事，你给句说话我好了！
You tell me one thing!

194
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,570
我们什么都看不到啊
we didn't see anything.

195
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,940
我们今日入来赤柱是游水的
we are here to swim!

196
00:14:47,910 --> 00:14:50,040
这一枪取你命
I want your life.

197
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,940
对不起，我不记得拿回条游水裤
I am sorry, I forgot my trunks!

198
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:55,980
什么游水裤呀？
what trunks?

199
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,030
不要啊，大佬！
Don't, please! Let me go, take the pistol!

200
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,920
这些枪你拿去，拿去啦！

201
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,690
我什么都看不到
I have seen nothing.

202
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:41,720
我…我出去游水！
I...I go to swim!

203
00:15:44,489 --> 00:15:47,612
No...

204
00:15:48,873 --> 00:15:53,567
Betrayed me?

205
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:53,000
出卖我？

206
00:16:06,690 --> 00:16:07,450
怎样？
Thanks.

207
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:08,320
谢谢！
Come over, my left ear can't hear!

208
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:09,850
今次发瘟了

209
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:12,200
我只耳朵好像给支枪震聋了

210
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,170
不是吧！你掩着右耳
It shouldn't, cover your right ear.

211
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:18,700
学军，你去他左面大声说话
Hok Kwan, speak loudly on his left.

212
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,860
看他听不听到
- See if he can hear! - Yes.

213
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,340
死啦，真是听不到啊！
I can't hear a thing!

214
00:16:32,650 --> 00:16:35,550
你行近些，对正些，大声些试下
Come closer, try to speak loudly!

215
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:41,430
死仔，玩我！
You bastard, fool me! I have enough!

216
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:42,450
还玩我不够啊！
I heard you told Negro Tong the other day...

217
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,990
前日你和黑鬼唐说

218
00:16:45,430 --> 00:16:47,900
打住，不要老友前老友后
"Shut up, I am not your friend!"

219
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:50,560
我个脑即时 “轰” 一声
I thought I would finish!

220
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,560
我想死定啦！

221
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,900
以为你们真是不理我了！
I thought you leave me alone!

222
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:58,840
别傻了，男子汉大丈夫嘛！
You fool, don't be narrow minded!

223
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,300
没这么小气的，大家是战友嘛！
we are comrades!

224
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:03,810
东哥！
Tung!

225
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:05,650
我碰到一个以前部队中的
I met my good friend in the army and his sister.

226
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:07,120
好朋友和他妹妹

227
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,180
有靓女呀？
Beautiful girl?

228
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,920
惩越战那时，他救过我的
He saved my life in the war.

229
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:14,190
他请我去他家里吃饭，我想请你批准
He invited me for dinner, I hope I can go!

230
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:15,380
他是怎样下来的？
when did he come?

231
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:16,930
五年前申请下来的
He got the permission five years ago.

232
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:22,930
小心点，别暴露身份
Be careful, don't expose yourself.

233
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:01,940
程警司！
Inspector Ching!

234
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:06,240
资本主义社会下产生的经济犯罪手法
The crimes under the property of HK...

235
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,870
真是光怪陆离
is really amazing!

236
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,940
我们现在接触到一宗
we have a "Self-kidnapping" case!

237
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:12,180
自己劫自己的怪案

238
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,650
案中珠宝商勾结坏份子
A jewelry shop owner rubbed his own shop.

239
00:18:15,690 --> 00:18:19,180
打劫自己的店铺，以骗取保险金
And tried to get the compensation!

240
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,990
而事后坏份子吞没赃物
His partners got away with the jewelry.

241
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,190
还勒索珠宝商
And blackmailed the owner.

242
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,590
透过大大的关系
Through Biggy...

243
00:18:26,630 --> 00:18:29,900
珠宝商打算聘请我们代为出头
The owner asked us to get the jewelleries back.

244
00:18:30,100 --> 00:18:31,470
夺回珠宝

245
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,200
订金在这里，你数数它呀大哥！
Boss, this is the deposit!

246
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:39,010
学军，数数它
Hok Kwan, check it.

247
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:57,900
不好意思几位老板
Sorry, we're late!

248
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,830
今日小姐们迟了点上班！

249
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,500
到来很久了吗？
Let me kiss you!

250
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,830
和你调个位
Let's change.

251
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:15,900
不用了！
No...!

252
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,640
对不起，不好意思！
Excuse me!

253
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,240
你的男朋友啊？
Your boyfriend?

254
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:30,560
傻仔，他是我契哥来的
He is my cousin!

255
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:33,160
不过他喜欢跳舞，所以时常上来！
He always comes here cause he likes dancing!

256
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,930
我以为他拥有你
I thought you were his.

257
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:36,360
你说什么啊？
what did you say?

258
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,030
对不起，我说错话
I am sorry!

259
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:42,940
我知道你想着些什么事的
I know what you are thinking.

260
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:45,270
不过你不要乱听人家说话
Don't listen to what people say!

261
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,040
我们这里不是个个小姐
Not every girl goes out with the guests here.

262
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,530
肯陪人客出街的

263
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:51,180
树大一定是有枯枝的啦
There are bad ones in a good family too!

264
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,740
一定有些人不自爱的

265
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:55,920
香港地行行都是这样的！
Every job is the same here in H.K.!

266
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:59,320
很多女明星一样为了钱出来卖身
Some of the stars "work" for money!

267
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:00,860
不过都是看自己的
It all depends!

268
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,760
我就不是这么贱格的！
I do behave!

269
00:20:03,490 --> 00:20:07,160
我嫌钱腥的，我情愿穷些，辛苦些
I don't really like money!

270
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,860
你说我这个人是否很硬颈呢？
Am I too mean?

271
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,860
怎会呢，我看你的人格值得敬佩就真
No, I respect you!

272
00:20:15,310 --> 00:20:16,290
多谢你！
Thanks!

273
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,110
我想找兴仔
I want to see Siu Hing.

274
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,750
什么，兴仔是你叫的吗？
what?

275
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:06,020
兴哥！
- Dear Hing! - Is that you?

276
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,220
你就是？
I am camel, Siu Hing is my superior!

277
00:21:07,290 --> 00:21:10,560
我就是驼龙，兴哥是我的大佬

278
00:21:17,470 --> 00:21:18,940
大佬，那个表叔来了
Hing, that bastard is coming.

279
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,340
我叫李向东，我是大圈的
I am Li Ho Tung, from China.

280
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,970
我是代表杨老板和你说话的！
I represent Boss Yeung!

281
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:29,740
你和我说话啊？
who are you talking to?

282
00:21:30,410 --> 00:21:31,640
他和我说话啊？
who is he talking too?

283
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:33,850
凭什么呀？
what has he got in hand?

284
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,190
姓杨那家伙派这呆子来
That Yeung bastard, sent a fool over.

285
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:39,860
算什么？
what does it mean?

286
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,190
这样更侮辱过打你两巴呢，大佬！
This means he doesn't respect you!

287
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,930
我要求你在两日之内
I want you to hand over your stuff,

288
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,990
即刻将所有的货无条件交还给我们
to us in two days' time!

289
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,670
这个是我传呼机号码
That's my paging number!

290
00:22:00,710 --> 00:22:04,080
你想清楚，两日之内随时传呼我吧！
Think it over, contact me in these two days!

291
00:22:17,390 --> 00:22:21,000
等我扑醒你啦，知不知和谁说话？
Do you know who you are talking to?

292
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,030
我祥兴在油尖区
My status in T.S.T. is the same as a mayor!

293
00:22:23,030 --> 00:22:25,400
就等如是你们广东省的省长

294
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,040
无论谁见到我都要立正，敬礼
Everyone has to salute at me!

295
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,010
只有我说给你听怎做
Only I can give the order.

296
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,340
你无资格教我怎样做的
You can't tell me what to do.

297
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,710
明不明白啊？
- Do you understand? - I understand!

298
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:38,440
我明白！

299
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:48,020
明日是我阿妈生日，打人不吉利
It's my mum's birthday tomorrow, we'll wait.

300
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:49,530
算你走运啦！
You are lucky!

301
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:52,650
回去说给姓杨知道，叫他不用再说了
Tell Mr. Yeung not to negotiate anymore.

302
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,500
我和我老母做完大寿
I have to celebrate my mum's birthday.

303
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,660
就会替他老母做忌，明不明白呀？
Then I will put his mum to sleep, understand?

304
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:58,730
我明白！
I understand!

305
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,740
还有，大笨圈！
Stupid!

306
00:23:03,170 --> 00:23:05,710
我以后不想在油尖区里见到你
I don't wanna see you in T.S.T. anymore. Understand?

307
00:23:05,710 --> 00:23:06,910
明不明白呀？
Understand!

308
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:07,770
我明白！

309
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:12,950
看什么呀，大笨圈！
what are you looking at?

310
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,680
下次见到你，剪掉你老二啦！
If I see you again, I chop yours off!

311
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:17,080
走！
Let's go!

312
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,610
今晚的行动
The target tonight is to insult Siu Hing publicly!

313
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,510
就是要在大庭广众里惩罚兴仔

314
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:50,910
成功的话
If we succeed.

315
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,360
我们就会争取到
we can build up our fame instantly!

316
00:23:52,360 --> 00:23:54,620
在最短时间内建立声名

317
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:57,490
打入香港的黑社会犯罪阶层
And joint the Hong Kong underground.

318
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:00,990
对方人多，战略上占绝大的优势
They have more people, so they are better off.

319
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,730
不过亦有极大的弱点
But they have their weak point too.

320
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:07,330
就是他们根本无任何作战的心理准备
They are not ready to fight!

321
00:24:08,010 --> 00:24:10,000
而且兴仔为人卑鄙
And because Siu Hing is selfish.

322
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,230
出席的各路英雄亦未必会插手
People may not help him!

323
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:16,910
这个亦都是香港人不团结的劣根性
That's Hong Kong people,

324
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,850
我们需要作出迅速
and we have to attack fast!

325
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:21,610
和决定性的要点攻击

326
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,450
然后尽快撤退
and retreat quickly!

327
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:28,250
整个过程不可以超过五分钟，明白吗？
The whole operation is no more than 5 minutes!

328
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:29,260
明白！
I understand!

329
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:34,660
利害，军事行动，十足打仗一样
Great, a military operation!

330
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,400
人家在上面不用召人
we don't need outside support!

331
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,560
分分钟都有几百个人在那里

332
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,170
一人一笃口水都浸死我们！
we get drawn easily!

333
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,270
要点攻击，我们得四个人而已
Main point attack!

334
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,540
上去开台打麻雀差不多
Four of us only better play Mahjong.

335
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,980
这些叫做 “找死” 啊！
we will surely die!

336
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,640
你的任务是负责两电
Your job is "Two Electrics".

337
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,280
还指挥我做事呢！
Give me orders!

338
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,290
不是呢，我是诚意邀请你参予
No, I sincerely ask you to join in.

339
00:25:00,420 --> 00:25:03,990
我没说不做，我像无义气的人吗？
I didn't say no!

340
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:07,290
不过我想请教一下，战友
But tell me.

341
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:10,070
什么事叫做两电哪？
what "Two Electrics" is?

342
00:25:10,070 --> 00:25:11,660
就是破坏电话总机
That's the phone and the switch!

343
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:13,790
和负责总电灯的开关掣

344
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,460
为什么我要做这些无聊的事呀？
why ask me to do such silly things?

345
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:17,540
因为这两个岗位
Because it's safe for you!

346
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:20,010
对你的性命来说是最安全

347
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:24,210
你们先混进去
- You two sneak in first! - Yes!

348
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:25,510
是！

349
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,700
贵哥，这么早到呀，随便…！
Boss Kwan, good on you!

350
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:44,400
恭喜！
Congratulations!

351
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,300
成哥，谭Sir，招呼不到，随便…！
Boss Shing, Tang Sir, thank you for you coming!

352
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,830
你死了去那里呀？
You get lost!

353
00:25:52,910 --> 00:25:54,310
叫了你们七点前好到的了嘛！
I said before seven, now it's eight already!

354
00:25:54,310 --> 00:25:55,300
现在几点钟呀？
what time is it?

355
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,910
以为你们撞车全死了！
I thought you got run over!

356
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:58,750
阿妈临出门口，条腰好痛
Mum's back hurt when coming!

357
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:00,240
要吃ABC才行得动嘛！
She had to take the drugs!

358
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,440
你在吃ABC
The guests were having prawn noodles!

359
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:03,720
那些人客就猛点虾球伊面

360
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,510
今日我分分钟白做呀！
I earn nothing today!

361
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,390
我都说了不好做的啦
I said no celebrations before!

362
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:08,860
生日一早过了啦！

363
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,960
你个仆街，这么大声是否想落个仔面啊
why talk to me that loud!

364
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:13,450
看看你件死人衫，穿得像拜山似的
The clothes are for corpse only!

365
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,730
正菁也！
That brings bad luck!

366
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,300
别这样，阿哥！
Stop that!

367
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,360
什么呀？驳嘴！
Damn it, respect me will you!

368
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:20,270
全都去死！
Go to hell!

369
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:33,480
No.1 ！
No.1!

370
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,010
各位嘉宾
Everybody, it's Mrs. Ko's birthday today.

371
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:58,570
今日是高老太的荣寿好日子

372
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,480
我代表本酒楼送首生日歌给高老太
Let's celebrate by singing!

373
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:04,970
兴哥，电话，是钟表行姓杨的打来
Go to hell!

374
00:27:01,964 --> 00:27:05,517
Hing, your call, it's from Mr. Yeung!

375
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:32,540
祝你生日快乐…！
Happy birthday to you...!

376
00:27:35,910 --> 00:27:46,220
祝你生日快乐…！
Happy birthday to you...!

377
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:52,950
全部趴低
Get down on your knees!

378
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:59,930
控制两电部门的手足给个讯息出来
Give me the signal!

379
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:01,930
打鼓！
Hit the drum!

380
00:28:12,050 --> 00:28:13,740
上，上啊！
Come, let's go!

381
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:17,880
无义气！
You chicken!

382
00:28:19,090 --> 00:28:19,890
好了
The whole place is under our control!

383
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:22,260
大家明白了我们已经控制了这个场面

384
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:24,860
兄弟
well you don't have to use the pistols!

385
00:28:25,230 --> 00:28:27,660
是英雄好汉就不用拿支枪出来靠吓

386
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,200
有本事就收起支枪，大家一起从长计议
Put down your gun, let's talk!

387
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,570
全部趴低，趴低！
Get down on your knees!

388
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,220
各位
Everybody we've to solve our problem!

389
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:50,520
我现在和兴仔解决一些私人的恩怨

390
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:53,290
请各单位的前辈给面子我李向东
And hope that I get the respect.

391
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:56,760
不要插手落这件事，明不明白？
Please stay out of it?

392
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:57,990
明白…！
- Understand? - Understand...

393
00:28:57,990 --> 00:28:59,020
说自己的罪状
Tell us your sin!

394
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,290
是我不对，吞了人家的货
I was wrong to take people's goods.

395
00:29:01,460 --> 00:29:02,830
我愿意退还出来
I promise to hand them back!

396
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:08,400
大声读！
Read it loud!

397
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,080
我兴仔，是契弟
Me, Siu Hing is a pimp.

398
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:13,880
今日其实不是我老母生日
It's not my mum's birthday, I wanna rip off!

399
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,080
存心捡兄弟便宜

400
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:17,350
我不孝，我闹老母，我打细妹
I am bad to my family!

401
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,710
我不是人，我是只狗
I am a beast!

402
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:25,650
大声些！
Louder!

403
00:29:27,890 --> 00:29:30,260
我今日真是罪有应得
I deserve what I should!

404
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:32,860
以后复仇，我活该给人打死
If not, you chop me!

405
00:29:36,330 --> 00:29:37,130
撤退！
Retreat!

406
00:29:37,570 --> 00:29:38,330
打鼓！
Hit the drum!

407
00:29:55,842 --> 00:29:57,613
Let's go!

408
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:00,020
走了，无事啦！

409
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:01,290
理不过，走了！
Please stay out, let's go!

410
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:03,190
你无事呀嘛？
- Are you alright? - You betrayer!

411
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,090
无义气！

412
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,360
饮杯水了，妈！
Mum, a cup of tea!

413
00:30:08,030 --> 00:30:10,000
我今晚真是饮得杯落
Let's drink!

414
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,660
我条气顺了
I'm very happy!

415
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:41,030
普天下被压迫的人民都有一本血泪账
All working people had a debt written in blood and tears.

416
00:30:41,030 --> 00:30:47,670
要报仇！要伸冤！要报仇！要伸冤！
They want to take revenge!

417
00:30:47,670 --> 00:30:53,740
血债要用血来偿
They wanna avenge!

418
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:03,090
消灭坐山雕，人民得解放
Finish the power, release the people.

419
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:11,930
翻身做主人，深山见太阳
To be the master, and see the sun again!

420
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,760
好啊！
Good!

421
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:18,770
京生，欠一个人打麻雀，入来！
we need one more person to play Mahjong!

422
00:31:22,870 --> 00:31:24,270
你和我个妹几合拍
You match with my sister.

423
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:30,170
介绍个老友给你们两个识
Come, meet my good friend!

424
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,040
我在解放军的死党，一齐出生入死
we were like brothers in war!

425
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:34,070
京生！
King San!

426
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:36,450
杨才，花名豺狼！      杨大哥！
- Nick name "wolf"! - Boss Yeung!

427
00:31:36,850 --> 00:31:37,750
叫阿狼得了！
Just call me "wolf"!

428
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:39,080
李明豹！
- Li Ming Pal! - How are you?

429
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:39,860
好吗？
- Boss Pal! - Come, sit down!

430
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,450
豹哥！              来，坐！

431
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,460
兄弟，你们最近敦煌酒楼那件事好利害啊
we done well at Tung wong!

432
00:31:48,830 --> 00:31:49,660
你怎知？
How did you know?

433
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,190
落了来几年就身光颈靓
we got rich in few years time.

434
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:53,860
你估我们做什么？
Guess what we do?

435
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:56,200
朋友的朋友刚说起
Friend's friend told me that.

436
00:31:56,370 --> 00:31:57,460
开档啦！
Let's play Mahjong!

437
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,820
原来星期日
You suspect their l.D. since Sunday?

438
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:24,090
你已经开始怀疑他们的身份了？

439
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:35,640
为什么你三日之后先报告？
why tell me after 3 days?

440
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:42,110
你不要忘记我们都是公安人员出身
Don't forget that we are cops!

441
00:32:42,450 --> 00:32:44,720
不应该同情那些犯罪份子
No sympathy on criminals!

442
00:32:44,790 --> 00:32:46,720
阿虎和我都是一六九师出身
Ah Fu and I were in 169 squad.

443
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,650
我们曾经出生入死
we stayed together.

444
00:32:49,990 --> 00:32:51,930
但是他现在可能是罪犯
He may be a criminal now.

445
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,660
对破坏社会秩序的坏份子
He is upsetting the society.

446
00:32:54,930 --> 00:32:56,520
我们绝对不可以手软
Don't be too passionate!

447
00:32:56,670 --> 00:32:58,030
七九年打越南
when we were fighting with the Vietkung in 79.

448
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:01,130
我给迫击炮碎片打中
I was hit by a bomb!

449
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,230
阿虎虽然亦都中了枪
And Ah Fu was shot too.

450
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:05,070
但是他仍然背着我走四里路
But he carried me for four miles!

451
00:33:05,070 --> 00:33:06,470
送我去战地医院
And he had saved my life!

452
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,280
那样我才捡回性命
My job is to charge him today!

453
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:11,670
今日我为了职责，检举他出来

454
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:13,980
已经觉得好内疚
I feel guilty.

455
00:33:14,580 --> 00:33:17,280
我这几晚都睡不安宁，你知不知呀？
I didn't get to sleep lately?

456
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,990
大陆人在这里给人歧视，为了什么？
People look down on the men from China,

457
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,990
就因为有阿虎这样的人
all because of people like Ah Fu.

458
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:24,760
这么辛苦，这么艰难落到来
They commit crimes here!

459
00:33:24,790 --> 00:33:27,350
不好好地做人，反而走去打、砸、抢
They become thieves here!

460
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:30,060
这些倒乱份子是应该消灭的
They should be kept in jail!

461
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:34,500
什么事呀，黑口黑面，死老豆吗？
Shut up, father is dead?

462
00:33:34,570 --> 00:33:35,900
闭上你的衰口！
Shut up your dirty mouth!

463
00:33:36,410 --> 00:33:38,310
狗嘴长不出象牙来
You can never be a gentleman.

464
00:33:48,690 --> 00:33:53,180
对不起，我老爸入了医院病了几个月
I am sorry, my dad is in the hospital!

465
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:57,290
希望他吉人天相，大步槛过啦，来！
I hope that he will recover!

466
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:01,330
东哥做的水饺真是No.1 ！
Boss, your shrimp dumplings are good!

467
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:04,490
这些水饺是你老豆教你做的？
Did your dad teach you?

468
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:07,130
是呀，我爸爸是山东人哪！
Yes, my dad is from Shan Tung!

469
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:12,140
在这个时候吃碗水饺来哀掉你老豆
To have shrimp dumplings now is meaningful!

470
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:13,440
真是够意思！
we can pay our respect to your dad!

471
00:34:20,650 --> 00:34:24,810
京生，你不是喜欢我做的水饺吗？
King San, you said you like my dumplings.

472
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,920
我做了整天了
I had spent a whole day, do have some!

473
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:29,250
你不是不赏面吧！

474
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:31,430
来，凉了！
Come, it's cold!

475
00:34:43,270 --> 00:34:47,070
长洲今次求你们帮他，要打蛇随棍上
It's a chance Cheung Chow asks for our help!

476
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,170
他和这么多人出货
He has been a sales representative!

477
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:51,440
无论如何都迫他说出来
Try to press him to tell us!

478
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:53,440
这样就可以追查到很多事情来啦！
Then we will have a lot of cases!

479
00:34:55,690 --> 00:34:58,890
-这么人齐呀，你估选美吗？ -认真赏面，请坐！
Please come in!

480
00:34:58,890 --> 00:35:00,190
长洲！
Cheung Chow!

481
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:01,590
赏面，多谢！
Thanks for coming!

482
00:35:01,590 --> 00:35:03,250
赏面…！

483
00:35:36,290 --> 00:35:38,890
说好是三十五元替他们出货的！
The deal was $350,000!

484
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:42,400
那几兄弟忽然间说我不老实
The Kwong brothers said I lied!

485
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,920
说起码值多十元
Obviously they put pressure on us?

486
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:46,490
大佬啊，那即是明抢我的

487
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,230
说不说口齿先
They don't keep their words!

488
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:50,240
所以我一直都好憎那些大圈的
That's why I hate "Big Circles"!

489
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,710
不是…只是那班大圈
No, I mean the people!

490
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,840
影响到你们的，你说是不是呀？
That spoils your image!

491
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,920
去胡混，有人静静地去胡混
Some one is fooling around.

492
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,160
姓江的这四兄弟
The Kwong brothers are very mysterious.

493
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:17,130
平时很少和其他大圈交往
They seldom fix up with other men from China.

494
00:36:17,530 --> 00:36:19,140
唯一知道他们出入的场所
The usual place they go is the Mahjong house.

495
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:20,470
就是瑞兴麻雀馆
They play for high stakes, minimum is $500.

496
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,740
打好大的，打的都五百、一千

497
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:27,330
这班人的钱怎来，无人知
The source of money is unknown.

498
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,670
他们都是第一次找长洲出货
It's the 1st time they wanna trade with Cheung Chow.

499
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:32,080
你盘算他们会带几多人来呢？
How many people will go together?

500
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:35,480
他们四兄弟加起来，已经是一支军队
The four of them make up an army!

501
00:36:35,950 --> 00:36:37,780
不会放长洲在眼内
The Kwongs won't be afraid of Cheung Chow.

502
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:41,450
不过这样，他们又不知长洲找什么人出头
Don't know who will stand for Cheung Chow!

503
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:43,760
所以今次他们好可能带枪
So they will have their guns.

504
00:36:46,830 --> 00:36:49,350
兄弟，和气生财啊！
Pal, keep calm!

505
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:50,690
做什么呀？
what? I am not an executor!

506
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:53,670
你以为我现在去执行打靶任务啊！

507
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:56,110
我惊你满脑子什么思想
I am afraid your mind is filled with killings,

508
00:36:56,110 --> 00:36:59,400
打击坏份子，不要手软那些坏事呀！
and no passion!

509
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:01,810
买了午夜场戏票了！
I have the mid-night show tickets!

510
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,050
你要记着
Remember to pick us up in this area!

511
00:37:09,050 --> 00:37:11,190
保持在这条街的范围内接应我们

512
00:37:11,190 --> 00:37:13,620
成了，你说了几十次啦！
I know, you have said a hundred times!

513
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:16,280
我买了午夜场戏票了！
I have got the mid-night show tickets!

514
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:19,190
是了，你说姓江的有四兄弟是不是？
Right, the four Kwongs are really brothers?

515
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:20,730
是！
Yes!

516
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:24,130
干什么呀？
why?

517
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:28,730
怎样？
How is it?

518
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:30,810
我调派广西那年
I had grabbed a rubber called Kwong in Kong Sai!

519
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,740
捉过一个姓江的抢劫犯

520
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:34,740
但是他好像得两兄弟而已
But he should have two brothers.

521
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:36,110
没这么巧吧？
was it that co-incidental?

522
00:37:36,450 --> 00:37:38,740
没收到消息说他们落了来香港
The data have no trace that they are in H.K.

523
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:40,410
应该不是他们
I don't think so!

524
00:37:43,350 --> 00:37:45,550
东哥！生哥！军哥！来…！
Heung Tung! King San! Hok Kwan! Come on...!

525
00:37:46,990 --> 00:37:47,750
请入来！
- Come in! - Please!

526
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:48,820
请内进！

527
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,020
几位，请入去！
Please come in!

528
00:37:55,500 --> 00:37:57,560
长哥，还有人会到！
No body here!

529
00:37:57,670 --> 00:37:58,570
开壶什么茶先呢？
what would you like to drink?

530
00:37:58,570 --> 00:38:00,230
普洱、寿眉、水仙一样一些啦！
Po Lee, Sau Mei, Jasmine, all of them!

531
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:00,960
好啊！
Right!

532
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:06,640
请内进！
This way please!

533
00:38:09,250 --> 00:38:11,250
糟，真是他们！
- Damn, it really is he! - what shall we do?

534
00:38:11,250 --> 00:38:12,080
怎办？
Be alert, get ready at any time!

535
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,650
提高警觉，随时会战斗

536
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:21,560
记着，我们的身份不可以泄露
Remember, never expose our identity!

537
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,790
几位，请入来！
Come in, please!

538
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,390
几位大哥，刚刚打电话传呼你们
The bosses have gone to call you!

539
00:38:29,730 --> 00:38:33,670
来…过来坐…这边…！
Come...please!

540
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:38,140
等我介绍，海哥，河哥，民哥，川哥
This is Boss Hoi, Boss Hok, Boss Ming, Boss Chu!

541
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:40,540
这几个好兄弟，东哥，生哥，军哥
Tung! San! King!

542
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,010
大家自己人
we are of the same origin.

543
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:45,850
正所谓同声同气，怎样都好说些嘛！
we can feel free! Alright?

544
00:38:45,850 --> 00:38:46,680
你说是不是？
- Hoi, what would you like? - Lung Chan!

545
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,750
饮什么茶啊，海哥？

546
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,580
龙井！
Lung Chan, get me a bottle of Lung Chan!

547
00:38:48,650 --> 00:38:51,250
龙井？飞壶龙井过来！

548
00:38:51,250 --> 00:38:52,020
好啊！
Yes!

549
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:58,730
这几位兄弟新落来的吗？
They just came out?

550
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:01,020
我们从赤泥逃出来
They are from Check Lai.

551
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:04,030
无路走，所以被逼要落来
They had no alternative, so they left.

552
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,800
敦煌酒楼打兴仔那件事
The fight at Tung wong restaurant was done by them!

553
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,140
就是他们的杰作
Tung, you look familiar!

554
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,900
东哥，好面善！

555
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,140
我们在那里见过面？
where did we meet before?

556
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,510
见过我实记得的！
I can remember even just seeing once!

557
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:19,650
你以前有无在桂林住过？
Have you ever stayed in Kwong Sai Kwai Lam?

558
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,050
未有机会，我一直都是住在广州
No chance, I stayed in Canton all the time!

559
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:26,660
你真的一直没有离开过广州？
How come you stayed there all the time?

560
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:31,930
你说什么话？
what did you say?

561
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:35,250
别装傻，桂林话你懂得听的
You should know the language of Kwong Sai!

562
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:36,570
老兄
Pals, are you talking business or kidding?

563
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,860
你们是来谈判的，还是来开玩笑的？

564
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:40,230
可以说清楚吗？
Can you tell me?

565
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,530
你曾经在桂林公安局做过事，是不是？
You had worked at the Kwai Lam Security Dept?

566
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:46,430
是你，错不了！
It's you, can't escape!

567
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,080
我记得你的手掌有枪伤
You have gun wound on your arm, what does it mean?

568
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,340
你不用装神弄鬼了

569
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,010
大哥啊，叫了你们和气生财的了！
I told you that politeness can make money already!

570
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,440
他叫我传呼你的
- He asks me to look for you! - How is he?

571
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,200
他怎样？
He won't get through!

572
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:55,140
没得救了！

573
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,750
阿江…我是阿狼
Ah Kong...I am Leung!

574
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:04,910
有什么事说给我听？
what do you want to tell me?

575
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,960
究竟是那班人干的？
who did this? I will finish them for you!

576
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:07,720
我一定帮你干掉他们！
Kwong Sai Security office, "Big Circle" undercover!

577
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:14,630
广西公安局，大圈卧底！

578
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,360
阿江…！
Ah Kong!

579
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,070
收拾好那些行医仪器
Hide the instrument!

580
00:41:29,450 --> 00:41:31,970
打电话报警，说他自己摸上来
Call the police, say he came here himself.

581
00:41:32,210 --> 00:41:34,980
我从来没有在这里出现过，你知的啦！
I have not been here, understand?

582
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,250
无问题！
Understand!

583
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,750
Fuck！ Fuck！
FUCK! FUCK!

584
00:41:45,630 --> 00:41:46,990
“勿” 是什么意思？
what's that meaning?

585
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:57,000
头条啊，黑帮无法无天
The headline-4 got killed in the public!

586
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:58,660
闹市枪杀四人
Trouble this time!

587
00:41:58,810 --> 00:41:59,870
这黑镬子走不了啦！
Sir, they discovered that Heung Tung is a cop.

588
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:03,200
程Sir，对方认出阿东是差人

589
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,280
他们身份如果泄露了出去
If their identity got revealed.

590
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:07,080
不可以再执行任务
They can't carry out their duty anymore.

591
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,420
要执包袱返乡下了！
They have to go back to China!

592
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,280
闭上你的嘴，不关你事！
Shut up, none of your business here!

593
00:42:11,350 --> 00:42:13,290
敦煌酒楼一次，现在又一次
First in Tung wong Rest. It's the second time.

594
00:42:13,690 --> 00:42:14,820
认出你又怎样！
So what if they recognize you?

595
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,080
在大陆做差人，落到来不可以做贼吗？
A cop back there, a thief here is the same.

596
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:19,920
香港很多差人转行做贼啦！
Many cops turn to be thieves here!

597
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:22,630
完全是你做贼心虚，作出过度反应
You are too nervous!

598
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:23,690
绝对不可能！
It's impossible!

599
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:27,020
在大陆从来无差人转行做贼
China cops will never be thieves.

600
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:28,730
他们都是有枪
They have pistols!

601
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,530
不通我们不可以自保吗？
Can't we self-defend ourselves?

602
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:32,500
我们是差人
we're a policeman!

603
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:35,610
打击坏份子，绝对不能手软的
It's our job to fight crime, we have to be tough!

604
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:38,080
这里是香港，香港是有法律的
Here is Hong Kong, it's a place of law and order.

605
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:40,110
不是在街见到那些贼就打死他
we can't just kill the thieves.

606
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:42,450
你是什么差人啊，是偷渡劳改犯而已
You are only a sneaker!

607
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:46,120
我劳改偷渡，完全是政治思想问题
I sneak in only for freedom.

608
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:47,790
你不好侮辱我人格
Please do respect me!

609
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:50,360
你再顶我的嘴，就捉你入去坐两年监
Shut up, or I put you in jail!

610
00:42:50,360 --> 00:42:51,590
然后再押你返大陆
And send you back to Mainland China. Fuck.

611
00:42:51,590 --> 00:42:52,360
Fuck！

612
00:42:57,600 --> 00:42:59,140
你们这些朋友好可能就是
Yours friends could be the ones we look for!

613
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:00,660
我们找了很久的悍匪来的
They killed 2 guards and a pedestrian!

614
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,530
他们打死过两个护卫员

615
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:03,510
打伤过一个路人
Hurting four policemen, keep an eye on them!

616
00:43:03,510 --> 00:43:05,470
四个警察，盯紧他们啊！

617
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:17,190
我是要生口，不要随意又打死他们
Catch them alive!

618
00:43:17,190 --> 00:43:18,650
程Sir，长洲他怎样？
Sir, how is Cheung Chow!

619
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:20,560
我收藏他在特别隔离房
I hide him in an isolated room.

620
00:43:20,590 --> 00:43:21,660
他晚晚都发恶梦
He has nightmares everyday!

621
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:23,450
惊你这班狂人会杀死他

622
00:43:29,700 --> 00:43:30,490
走！
Let's go!

623
00:43:31,970 --> 00:43:33,160
饮 “B” 酒！
Let's go to have some bear!

624
00:43:34,040 --> 00:43:36,060
啤酒，不是B酒！
Beer! Not bear! FUCK!

625
00:43:36,270 --> 00:43:37,000
Fuck！

626
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,310
阿虎今日不回来吗？
will Ah Fu come back?

627
00:43:55,490 --> 00:43:57,690
几日都不见人，都不知干什么
He is missing for a few days.

628
00:43:58,960 --> 00:43:59,930
好热啊！
So hot!

629
00:44:01,860 --> 00:44:06,300
那个冷气坏坏的，你喝不喝啤酒？
The air-cond. is no good, you want some beer?

630
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,190
我自己拿行了！
I get it myself!

631
00:44:19,450 --> 00:44:20,240
好热啊！
So hot!

632
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:24,540
怕什么丑呢，成年人了
Don't be shy, you are old enough!

633
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:29,320
穿回衣服，有些正经事和你谈
Put on your clothes, I got to talk to you!

634
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,140
大家都是自己人，本来什么都可以谈
Actually we can talk about anything!

635
00:44:44,770 --> 00:44:45,980
以前没这个必要
It wasn't time to let Ah Fu tell you!

636
00:44:45,980 --> 00:44:47,530
我叫阿虎先不好跟你说

637
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:51,170
其实你都想到，我们三个是做明攻
I think you can guess!

638
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,380
我想了有几个月 ，去做间银行
we plan to rob the bank!

639
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:58,450
有成六、七百粒现水
There will be around $7.0M.

640
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:01,120
我想找你和你两个兄弟帮手
I hope you two can help me!

641
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:02,180
饮啤酒啦！
Some beer!

642
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:10,860
为何会找我们？
why look for us suddenly?

643
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:14,660
一来，你们的身手够好，和我们差不多
well, you are cruel enough!

644
00:45:14,900 --> 00:45:17,570
二来，你和阿虎的交情，信得过
And because of Ah Fu, we can trust you!

645
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,270
三来，和我们一向合作的那几个
Our old partners are gone!

646
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:22,700
突然间潜逃了
And they can't have the share!

647
00:45:23,080 --> 00:45:24,570
注定我们有缘啦！

648
00:46:05,750 --> 00:46:07,220
God， come again！
God, come again!

649
00:46:07,660 --> 00:46:09,020
Madam， help
Madam, help, madam...Come again!

650
00:46:10,830 --> 00:46:13,450
Madam… Come again！

651
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:16,000
It's okay， Mariana！
It's O.K., Mariana!

652
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,330
Him， my darling， okay！
Him, my darling, O.K.!

653
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:21,000
Okay， I see！
OK, I see!

654
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,030
是谁人干的？
That team of people?

655
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:24,230
谁干谁干，天晓得！
who knows who did it?

656
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:26,830
又无凿个字在额头，又无穿着制服的
There was no uniform, no writing!

657
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,770
大圈仔！
The "Big Circle"!

658
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,480
最衰你个死人Mariana！
Because of your Mariana!

659
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:33,350
干什么不问清楚就开门给人入来
You let people in so easily!

660
00:46:33,750 --> 00:46:35,480
刚才我洗完头回来
I was drying my hair when they rushed in.

661
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,480
那些人就扑过来了

662
00:46:39,290 --> 00:46:40,480
有无污辱你呀？
Did they insult you?

663
00:46:42,020 --> 00:46:43,550
当然是无啦！
No!

664
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:47,550
打我啊，问我长洲躲藏在那里
But hit me, ask me where Cheung Chow was hiding.

665
00:46:49,030 --> 00:46:49,870
你看看
Look at my fingers!

666
00:46:49,870 --> 00:46:52,490
十只手指都给他们打到扁了！

667
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:54,100
阴功！
Oh no!

668
00:46:57,640 --> 00:46:59,640
我不依呀，打烂了所有东西
I don't care, they have taken anything!

669
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:01,300
还拿了我的首饰

670
00:47:03,380 --> 00:47:04,470
You stupid！
YOU STUPlD!

671
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:08,480
我刚才想了想傻到想自杀呀！
I was going to kill myself!

672
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:11,520
不要这样，达令，不要哭啦！
Stop that darling, don't cry!

673
00:47:12,420 --> 00:47:13,820
你不见了多少钱哪？
How much did you lose?

674
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,290
加上姐妹放在我这里的手饰
Altogether is more than $200,000!

675
00:47:17,290 --> 00:47:18,780
大约二十几万

676
00:47:19,560 --> 00:47:20,720
这么多钱啊？
That much?

677
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:28,800
你去那里？
where are you going?

678
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:30,200
去那里不好
Anywhere, just to leave this place!

679
00:47:30,870 --> 00:47:32,810
总之离开这个伤心地啦！

680
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:34,640
这些姐妹那样信我
How can I face them, they trust me!

681
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:36,540
我怎样向人家交待

682
00:47:37,050 --> 00:47:38,310
钱等我想想办法
Let me think!

683
00:47:38,310 --> 00:47:40,910
你不用走，我可以保护你呀！
I can protect you, don't go!

684
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,190
你可以保护我一世吗？
Can you protect me for my whole life?

685
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:45,820
那些人说，如果我知道些事不说
Those people warned me of telling the truth.

686
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,810
就会毁我容的！
Or they will hurt me on my face!

687
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:50,750
我知道长洲那件事你有份的
I know you were involved in Cheung Chow's case.

688
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:53,820
我宁愿死，刚才都无出卖你
I won't betray you!

689
00:47:55,060 --> 00:47:58,230
谁叫我喜欢你呢，前世欠了你的！
Because I can't help loving you!

690
00:47:59,940 --> 00:48:01,130
算吧，学军！
Forget it, Hok Kwan!

691
00:48:01,470 --> 00:48:03,840
我们分开吧，有缘无份！
we better break up!

692
00:48:04,610 --> 00:48:08,170
达令…不要离开我
Darling, don't leave me alone.

693
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:10,070
无了你，我会死的！
I will die without you!

694
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:13,640
我以后见不到你，你估我心不痛吗？
My heart breaks without seeing you!

695
00:48:14,120 --> 00:48:16,320
不过长痛不如短痛呀！
But shorten the pain!

696
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:18,750
我跟着你都无好日子过的
It won't be good if we stay together.

697
00:48:18,920 --> 00:48:21,650
你出来混的，今日不知明日事
You don't have a steady income!

698
00:48:21,860 --> 00:48:25,090
我怎可以为我的爱人日日提心吊胆呀
And I worry about your life!

699
00:48:25,360 --> 00:48:26,990
我整天在幻想
It's only my fancy!

700
00:48:27,360 --> 00:48:29,000
如果我有三、四十万
I will go with you if I had $350,000!

701
00:48:29,000 --> 00:48:30,300
我就会带你一齐走
we go to Hawaii!

702
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:32,970
一齐去夏威夷，在世外桃源里

703
00:48:32,970 --> 00:48:34,340
我们重新开始
And start all over again!

704
00:48:34,340 --> 00:48:36,000
过些自由自在的生活

705
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,070
三、四十万不是一个问题
$350,000 is not a problem!

706
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:39,940
但是我不可以走的！
But I can't leave!

707
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:41,000
你无护照啊？
Don't you have a passport?

708
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:41,910
不要紧
I can get you a forge passport!

709
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:44,000
我识人可以帮你买个假护照

710
00:48:44,150 --> 00:48:45,580
这样全世界都可以去啦！
Then we can go anywhere!

711
00:48:45,780 --> 00:48:47,320
有证都是无用的！
It's no use having the passport!

712
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,370
为什么？
why?

713
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:50,910
我不能说给你听的
I can't tell you!

714
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:53,560
原来你说来说去都是想玩我的
So you lie to me!

715
00:48:53,560 --> 00:48:55,060
你由头到尾都是无诚意的
You only play with me!

716
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:56,060
你走，走呀
I can swear...!

717
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:57,460
达令…我可以发毒誓
I really want to marry you!

718
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:59,500
我是一心一意娶你做老婆的！

719
00:48:59,500 --> 00:49:00,660
你正衰人来的
Go to hell, I won't trust you!

720
00:49:00,660 --> 00:49:02,290
我以后都不会信男人的了！

721
00:49:03,830 --> 00:49:06,490
好了…我说给你知
O.K. I tell you!

722
00:49:06,900 --> 00:49:08,030
但你要守秘密！
But you have to keep to secret!

723
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,640
我不是什么事坏份子，我是差人
I am an informer!

724
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,110
我在大陆当差的
The police wants us to be undercovers!

725
00:49:12,110 --> 00:49:14,010
所以香港警方逼我们做卧底

726
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:14,910
什么？
what?

727
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:29,710
干什么，有心事啊？
what's wrong?

728
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:31,320
没有！
Nothing!

729
00:49:33,460 --> 00:49:36,120
大家战友嘛，说出来听听

730
00:49:39,030 --> 00:49:40,470
我刚刚收到个消息

731
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:42,460
我老爸的病好危险

732
00:49:43,340 --> 00:49:45,530
估不到你这么高大都这么孝顺！
I didn't know that you love your parents!

733
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,140
我阿妈很早就死了
My mum died early!

734
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,970
我两父子相依为命
I live with my dad!

735
00:49:50,210 --> 00:49:53,340
我做军人或者做差人他都引以为荣
He is proud of me as a cop!

736
00:49:56,050 --> 00:49:59,150
说真呢，我老爸是个老实的教员
He is a good teacher!

737
00:50:00,590 --> 00:50:04,750
我这次从劳改场那里偷渡下来香港
This time I sneaked into Hong Kong!

738
00:50:05,730 --> 00:50:07,890
连累他给人审到心脏病发
He was questioned real hard.

739
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:11,760
你说，如果他为我死了
So, if my dad died because of me.

740
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,200
你叫我怎做人呢？
what do I do?

741
00:50:23,710 --> 00:50:24,800
天要下雨
It looks like raining!

742
00:50:26,450 --> 00:50:27,920
没有办法呀！
Nothing I can do!

743
00:50:31,450 --> 00:50:33,280
都是说回些正经事先
Let's talk business!

744
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:38,480
究竟是那班人同江氏兄弟出头呢？
who is behind the four brothers?

745
00:50:39,190 --> 00:50:40,390
查不到！
Don't know?

746
00:50:41,460 --> 00:50:43,190
不过外面周围有消息流出
It was said that I was responsible!

747
00:50:43,530 --> 00:50:45,190
说这件事是我促成的

748
00:50:46,030 --> 00:50:47,300
我要全背上身的了！
It gets on me!

749
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:49,340
不过到目前为止
But nobody will know you did it!

750
00:50:49,340 --> 00:50:51,030
都未有人知道是你们干的

751
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:55,240
我明天就去新界，去我老表那里躲藏先
I will hide away in the New Territories!

752
00:50:57,050 --> 00:50:57,910
去多久？
For how long?

753
00:50:59,180 --> 00:51:00,210
很难说的
Hard to say!

754
00:51:00,620 --> 00:51:03,020
无那么风大雨大了，就回来！
I wait till things calm down!

755
00:51:04,390 --> 00:51:07,620
惯啦，年中实有几次要潜逃的
I am used to this way of living!

756
00:51:08,820 --> 00:51:09,760
对不起！
Sorry!

757
00:51:10,660 --> 00:51:13,320
我现在才体会到做卧底的滋味
I now realize your way of life!

758
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:19,160
我命硬，死不去！
I am tough, I survive!

759
00:51:20,970 --> 00:51:22,630
我不似得你们打过仗
I haven't been to wars.

760
00:51:23,710 --> 00:51:24,760
不过你看看
But look at me!

761
00:51:26,070 --> 00:51:31,380
全身上下，由头到脚，无块肉是好的
I have stitches allover my body!

762
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:36,780
有些是古惑仔弄的，有些是差佬弄的
Some by thieves, some by police.

763
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:40,250
我做了这行十三年
To do my job it's been 1 3 years.

764
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,850
人不似人，鬼不似鬼
Don't know what I look like!

765
00:51:43,730 --> 00:51:47,460
做卧底正一开大又死，开细又死！
An informer will die sooner or later!

766
00:51:48,830 --> 00:51:51,260
遇到差佬就惊他当你是贼
The cops think that I am a thief.

767
00:51:51,930 --> 00:51:55,100
遇到古惑仔又惊他知你是差佬
The thief may think that I am a cop!

768
00:51:56,100 --> 00:51:59,010
日日提心吊胆，晚晚都无觉好睡
I worry all the time!

769
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,210
你大哥干完这两年后
You can stay on for two years and change.

770
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:04,010
可以转行做第二样事

771
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:07,410
我，我是什么？
As for me?

772
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:12,220
朋友又无，老婆又走路
I have no friends and my wife is gone!

773
00:52:13,360 --> 00:52:18,820
说得难听一点，将来就算我死在街里
To be pessimistic!

774
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:20,890
都无英国旗盖啦！
I won't have the national salute!

775
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,190
你说像什么！
what do you think?

776
00:52:24,630 --> 00:52:25,690
你说啊！
You say it!

777
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:29,900
他老母！
Damn it!

778
00:52:31,670 --> 00:52:32,730
你明的啦！
Do you understand?

779
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:37,910
我明，我明白的！
Yes, I understand!

780
00:52:39,550 --> 00:52:40,450
你知不知呀！
Do you know!

781
00:52:40,650 --> 00:52:43,810
你们几个初初来时，傻得几可爱
But you were quite smart!

782
00:52:44,220 --> 00:52:45,450
我知你们看不起我的！
I know you look down on me!

783
00:52:46,420 --> 00:52:52,220
实说我做事断估，怕死，不修边幅
You said that I was a worthless coward.

784
00:52:52,330 --> 00:52:54,920
是不是？你不用不认了！
Right? Don't deny that!

785
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:58,930
最初我是觉得你很嚣张的！
I felt that you were bad!

786
00:52:59,630 --> 00:53:00,530
现在呢？
And now?

787
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:05,230
还是很嚣张，不过蛮算几有义气
But you are a real pal!

788
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:07,870
我够知了，不用你说呀，挑！
I know, you don't have to say!

789
00:53:22,990 --> 00:53:25,980
我想做完今年就退休不干了
I will retire after this year.

790
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,560
我储了几年钱的
I have saved more than $100,000!

791
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:34,000
多就无了，十万，八万啦！

792
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:40,700
想搞些小生意，打工无发达的！
I can run my own business!

793
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:45,610
这个送给你
This is for you!

794
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:46,900
送给我？
For me?

795
00:53:48,320 --> 00:53:49,180
真的？
Really?

796
00:53:57,930 --> 00:54:02,300
说开又说，你包的饺子No.1 ，真是棒
Your dumplings are good!

797
00:54:02,930 --> 00:54:04,970
我将来回来的时候，记得包给我吃啊！
Give me some more other time!

798
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:06,190
你吃得几多只啊？
How many can you have? 50?

799
00:54:06,870 --> 00:54:07,730
五十只啊？
80!

800
00:54:08,170 --> 00:54:09,640
八十只呀！

801
00:54:14,280 --> 00:54:15,000
再见！

802
00:56:32,950 --> 00:56:37,480
杀了我…！
Kill me...!

803
00:56:39,250 --> 00:56:42,160
杀了我，无东西说呀！
Kill me, I don't know anything!

804
00:56:48,630 --> 00:56:51,900
老友，你这里是不是有病啊？
Bastard, something wrong here?

805
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:54,360
你说，是那边班人干的
I give you a chance, tell me who did it!

806
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,160
我会给条路你行
I'll fulfill your wish to be a hero!

807
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:59,670
你不肯说，硬要做英雄，我会成全你

808
00:57:00,480 --> 00:57:06,510
我…我什么都不知
I...I don't know!

809
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:47,120
等我打他两下心口
Let me punch him and let the rats...

810
00:57:47,190 --> 00:57:48,820
他张开口一叫的时候

811
00:57:48,860 --> 00:57:51,260
这些老鼠走了入去他的肚里乱跑
get into his mouth.

812
00:57:51,360 --> 00:57:52,620
我就不信他不说
Then he will talk!

813
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:10,970
好啦，你的记忆恢复来啦！
O.K. have you got back your memories!

814
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:13,170
我现在要你大声说几个名出来听听
I want you to tell me a few names!

815
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:25,190
仆街，死蛤！
Damn it!

816
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:27,460
全家死，我们要杀你呀
I'll kill you!

817
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:28,990
你这么有义气，为什么呀！
You want to be a hero!

818
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,290
老友，这班人值得你为他们死吗？
Is it worthwhile?

819
00:58:33,670 --> 00:58:36,100
他们救过我性命
They have saved my life.

820
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:39,900
我当那次我已经死了
I have put myself to death already.

821
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:41,070
怎样？
How is it?

822
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:44,510
他不会说的了，埋了他！
He won't tell, kill him!

823
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:46,380
你本事！
You have got guts!

824
00:59:39,770 --> 00:59:40,530
东哥！
Tung!

825
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:08,600
不会吧，真是死了？
- what? Is he die? - Yes.

826
01:00:08,600 --> 01:00:09,360
是！

827
01:01:12,830 --> 01:01:14,020
我说给你们听
I tell you all!

828
01:01:14,430 --> 01:01:16,420
大大是间接给你们害死的
Biggy was actually killed by you!

829
01:01:17,530 --> 01:01:19,260
为了你们，我不用旨意升职啦！
I don't want promotion because of you!

830
01:01:19,530 --> 01:01:21,470
警务署长个位我都无得做啦！
I'll be fired soon!

831
01:01:22,370 --> 01:01:24,630
警务署长说即刻要拉了你们三个
The commissioners wants you under custody.

832
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:27,440
律政司就考虑是不是要告你们
The legal dept. wants to prosecute you.

833
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:29,540
就算不告，二十四小时之内
If no prosecution, they send you back in 24 hrs.

834
01:01:29,580 --> 01:01:31,370
随时都会押你们返大陆

835
01:01:31,610 --> 01:01:32,180
程Sir！
- Sir! - Stop.

836
01:01:32,180 --> 01:01:33,840
不用Sir了，我无用
I am useless! I can't control the three of you.

837
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:35,540
我管不了你们三个

838
01:01:35,620 --> 01:01:38,090
我们破了这么多案，难道无功劳吗？
we have finished many cases!

839
01:01:38,090 --> 01:01:39,550
所以我才帮你们求情
So I ask for amnesty!

840
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:40,890
如果拉了阿虎那班人
Go to fix up wolf's team, there could be a chance.

841
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:42,650
或者有些转机的

842
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:44,460
那件事什么进展啊？
How are they now?

843
01:01:45,190 --> 01:01:46,900
他们都叫我们准备
They ask us to be ready the job in 24 hours.

844
01:01:46,900 --> 01:01:48,890
在二十四小时内随时动手

845
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:50,530
就是早两日说那间银行？
- The same bank you said before? - Yes!

846
01:01:50,530 --> 01:01:51,260
是呀！
Do as you are told!

847
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,570
照做啦！

848
01:01:54,740 --> 01:01:57,900
还有，你阿爸过了身了
And your dad is dead!

849
01:01:58,940 --> 01:02:01,270
有封电报发去你的通讯地址
There was a telex at your place...

850
01:02:01,640 --> 01:02:03,010
我不觉意看到的
Sorry!

851
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:04,610
对不起！

852
01:02:05,510 --> 01:02:06,280
程Sir
Sir, was there any word from my father?

853
01:02:07,750 --> 01:02:11,380
电报有无说我阿爸有遗言交待给我？

854
01:02:11,550 --> 01:02:13,280
不知道，怕没有了！
I don't know! Sorry!

855
01:02:14,520 --> 01:02:15,390
对不起！

856
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:31,200
他老味啊，我们替他搏命
Damn it, we work hard for him!

857
01:02:31,510 --> 01:02:32,700
现在给他利用完了
Now he send us back, what does it mean?

858
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:34,640
又遣返我们上去，算什么意思？

859
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:36,440
你说！
You say it!

860
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:39,710
东哥，和这些人合作不过的
Tung, Mr. Ching is cunning!

861
01:02:39,950 --> 01:02:41,640
阿虎这事都是推了他好些
we stop Ah Fu's operation!

862
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:43,650
不可以！
No!

863
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:50,450
由不得我们不做，现在唯有见步行步
we have started, we have to insist on!

864
01:02:53,090 --> 01:02:55,260
我都不知我们现在为了什么！
I don't know what for!

865
01:02:56,030 --> 01:02:58,460
你阿爸刚刚死了，他仍然这样逼你
He has no mercy, your dad just died!

866
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:00,920
你就要出卖老友
You betrayed your friend.

867
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,470
为了什么？为了破案哪？
why? why finish the cases?

868
01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:05,530
香港有二万几个差人
There are 20,000 police in H.K.

869
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:07,160
为什么要我们破案？
why we have to do the investigation?

870
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:08,740
为了居留？
Just for staying here?

871
01:03:08,940 --> 01:03:11,840
姓程那契弟吃定我们不放的了
Mr. Ching has got our weak point.

872
01:03:12,080 --> 01:03:13,480
就算我们干足两年
Even if we worked for 2 years, he won't let us go.

873
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:14,880
他都不会放过我们
He will force us to carry on.

874
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:16,680
一定要我们干下去

875
01:03:17,050 --> 01:03:18,480
等他可以升官发财
And he gets promoted!

876
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:20,280
我们的仇人就越来越多
And we have more enemies.

877
01:03:20,560 --> 01:03:22,550
迟早学似大大这样的收场
we will end up like Biggy!

878
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:24,950
越想越心淡
I'm afraid!

879
01:03:26,260 --> 01:03:27,160
上晚啊
I dreamt we went to Hawaii!

880
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:29,760
我发梦我们三个带了很多钱走去夏威夷

881
01:03:30,060 --> 01:03:31,690
在沙滩里晒太阳
And sun bathing on the beach!

882
01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:33,900
戴着些名牌太阳眼镜

883
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:36,000
一双一对这样
In pairs!

884
01:03:36,370 --> 01:03:39,570
我就和黛安娜，京生和继红
Me and Diana, King San with Hung!

885
01:03:40,010 --> 01:03:42,170
东哥你啊，说你都不信
You won't believe it Tung.

886
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:45,010
你和鬼妹啊！身材No.1的！
Your girl has good figure!

887
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:48,610
学军，我们什么身份都无，去得那里
Hok Kwan, we can't go anywhere without a passport.

888
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:56,190
我发梦而已！
I was dreaming!

889
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:59,420
我们当然不会这样做啦！
we have nowhere to go!

890
01:05:11,170 --> 01:05:12,260
小姐，麻烦你
I am sorry, miss!

891
01:05:19,170 --> 01:05:21,570
不用这么紧张，无事的
Don't worry, it's O.K.!

892
01:05:24,910 --> 01:05:25,610
谢谢！
Thanks!

893
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:27,480
走吧！
Let's go!

894
01:05:32,420 --> 01:05:33,480
机场移民局是吗？
Immigration?

895
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:35,380
我要举报一个中国籍的男人
I wanna report a Chinese male,

896
01:05:35,720 --> 01:05:38,490
他行使一本姓名叫做李大忠的假护照
using a Li Tai Chung passport...

897
01:05:38,690 --> 01:05:40,520
他会搭BC-100班机离境
He will take flight BC-100!

898
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:43,430
他五尺四寸高，短头发，大眼
He is 5'4", short hair, big eyes!

899
01:05:51,470 --> 01:05:52,270
这些钱安全的吗？
The money has been exchanged?

900
01:05:52,270 --> 01:05:53,210
全在这里了！
It's in the bag!

901
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:54,230
海关会不会查？
would the customs look at immigration?

902
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:57,040
放心啦，香港带钱出入境是自由的
H.K. has no financial control!

903
01:05:57,210 --> 01:05:57,910
入去了！
Let's go!

904
01:06:00,280 --> 01:06:01,840
干什么，你不开心啊？
what's upsetting?

905
01:06:01,980 --> 01:06:03,810
不是，开心…！
No, I am happy.

906
01:06:05,750 --> 01:06:06,720
这么快不拖我啦？
You don't miss me?

907
01:06:15,560 --> 01:06:18,230
不用这么紧张，现在又不是偷渡
Don't worry, it's O.K.!

908
01:06:18,330 --> 01:06:20,730
大摇大摆地行过去就得的了！
Let's go!

909
01:06:25,670 --> 01:06:27,070
我不记得帮你买胃药
You line up first, I go to get the drug!

910
01:06:27,070 --> 01:06:28,170
你替我排着队先啊！

911
01:06:33,110 --> 01:06:34,780
你的护照就到期了
will be a change your passport!

912
01:06:43,620 --> 01:06:45,560
先生，拿个护照给我看看
Mister. Can I have your passport?

913
01:06:50,730 --> 01:06:53,360
先生，请你跟我入房，我有些事问你
Mister. Please come with me, we want to talk with you!

914
01:07:08,780 --> 01:07:09,480
不要跑！
Don't go!

915
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:29,470
我现在个心在卜卜跳啊
My heart beats fast, go quick!

916
01:07:29,470 --> 01:07:30,800
行快两步啦！
Don't worry, it's O.K.!

917
01:07:30,870 --> 01:07:32,640
你定吧，无事的！

918
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,230
我们架车去到土瓜湾
He knew the end at To Kwa wan!

919
01:07:34,310 --> 01:07:36,000
他就会发觉自己上当了啦！

920
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:54,660
打死你！
I'll kill you!

921
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:26,190
走啊…快走啊！
Get away! Get away quickly!

922
01:08:26,590 --> 01:08:27,990
什么事啊？
Oh no!

923
01:08:37,070 --> 01:08:37,970
干什么啊！

924
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:45,700
你干嘛你？
what are you doing?

925
01:08:46,380 --> 01:08:47,710
他妈的，赶死啊！
You want to die!

926
01:09:05,130 --> 01:09:06,000
那面有无啊？
- You take a look over there! - No!

927
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:06,630
无呀！
And you check the taxi station!

928
01:09:06,630 --> 01:09:08,030
无呀？去的士站那面！

929
01:09:15,040 --> 01:09:15,840
东哥！
Tung!

930
01:09:26,090 --> 01:09:27,450
他拿了钱走？
He's take the money gone?

931
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:36,930
学军…开门！
Hok Kwan, open the door!

932
01:09:48,240 --> 01:09:50,640
这些钱是呈堂的证物，你打算怎么办？
The money is evidence, what do you want to do?

933
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:54,040
我以为黛安娜真心爱我的
I thought Diana really loved me!

934
01:09:54,550 --> 01:09:56,680
他说嫁给我，和我一齐走的
She said she would follow me!

935
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:57,650
那你又回来？
why did you come back?

936
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:00,080
他骗了我
She deceived me!

937
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:05,460
她另外有个情人，去到机场她出卖我
She has another man, she betrayed me at the airport.

938
01:10:06,260 --> 01:10:08,990
和那些海关人员告密说我那个是假护照
She told the immigration that I had a forged passport!

939
01:10:09,830 --> 01:10:11,090
给我走甩了
I managed to escaped!

940
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:14,090
和那些干警打起上来
And fought with the police.

941
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:18,160
抢了支枪，打伤了个臭男人
I snatched a gun and hurt the man.

942
01:10:18,470 --> 01:10:20,170
这些事你都做得出来
How dare you!

943
01:10:20,910 --> 01:10:22,900
长洲件案就来开审了
Cheung Chow's case is under proceeding.

944
01:10:23,180 --> 01:10:25,480
这笔钱过两日要给回程警司
we have to return the money in two days.

945
01:10:25,650 --> 01:10:26,980
现在钱不见了
The money is now lost.

946
01:10:27,820 --> 01:10:29,810
还在机场干出这些事来
And you made a mess in the airport.

947
01:10:31,620 --> 01:10:33,920
我们坐定监啦，你知不知呀？
we will end up in jail?

948
01:10:34,460 --> 01:10:35,120
东哥！
- Tung! - Go away!

949
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:35,710
行开！

950
01:10:36,990 --> 01:10:38,980
我知错了，我对你们不起
I know I was wrong, I am sorry!

951
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:40,930
我这种人不死都是无用的了
I don't deserve surviving!

952
01:10:41,060 --> 01:10:43,390
我现在打死我自己来补偿我的过失
I die for my wrong doings!

953
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:44,830
行开！
Go away!

954
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:48,330
你开枪打死你自己，有个屁用呀！
It doesn't help even if you shoot yourself!

955
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:51,730
我带你两个出来
when we came here, we said live and die together.

956
01:10:52,170 --> 01:10:55,010
说过三个人要同生共死

957
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:58,110
在这个这么困难的时候，你离开我们
You kill yourself at this critical moment.

958
01:10:58,350 --> 01:11:00,140
这样证明你是一个懦夫
That proves you are a chicken!

959
01:11:00,650 --> 01:11:02,950
证明你坚持自己的罪行到底
You are irresponsible...

960
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:06,450
你无义气，对不起我，对不起京生
you should be sorry to me and King San!

961
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:12,920
对不起你自己，你开枪啦，开枪啦…
If you have the guts, pull the trigger!

962
01:11:16,030 --> 01:11:19,260
那个舞女知不知我们的身份，知不知啊？
Those ballroom-girl, do they know about you?

963
01:11:19,630 --> 01:11:21,570
我全说给她听了！
I have told her!

964
01:11:24,740 --> 01:11:25,530
学军！
Hok Kwan!

965
01:11:29,680 --> 01:11:30,540
阿虎啊！
Ah Fu!

966
01:11:31,650 --> 01:11:32,630
入去先啊！
Get in!

967
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:39,080
亚虎，这么夜呀！
Ah Fu, you've come here at night!

968
01:11:40,790 --> 01:11:42,190
你们准备好发财未呀？
Are you ready to get rich?

969
01:11:50,730 --> 01:11:52,670
现在集合，明日行动！
we gather here and do it tomorrow!

970
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,290
今晚要集宿和开会
we have a meeting tonight.

971
01:11:55,070 --> 01:11:56,800
精神啊，走吧！
Cheer up, let's go!

972
01:12:13,820 --> 01:12:15,690
是这里了，入来！
It's here, come in!

973
01:12:23,630 --> 01:12:26,230
所有传呼机大家都交出来
Leave your pager here, and stay here!

974
01:12:26,570 --> 01:12:27,430
不要出去

975
01:12:31,210 --> 01:12:33,400
过来，坐！
Come, sit!

976
01:12:36,280 --> 01:12:37,710
几百万就在对面
The few million dollars are over there.

977
01:12:38,610 --> 01:12:40,840
看着架解款车来才过去
we go over after seeing the armor truck.

978
01:12:40,980 --> 01:12:43,350
有什么风吹草动，随时可以看到
we can see if anything goes wrong.

979
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:46,920
又不用怕塞车，很好吧！
No traffic jam, good spot!

980
01:12:54,660 --> 01:12:55,630
不用这么紧张
I'll tell you the details!

981
01:12:55,630 --> 01:12:57,400
一会我会说清那些细节给你们听

982
01:12:57,400 --> 01:12:58,330
轻松一下先吧！
Relax!

983
01:13:01,370 --> 01:13:02,730
坐啊，来！
Come, sit!

984
01:13:04,740 --> 01:13:05,710
打一、二百？
$100 or $200?

985
01:13:05,710 --> 01:13:07,370
是，照旧了！
Yes!

986
01:13:17,350 --> 01:13:18,580
你都来干什么？
what are you doing here?

987
01:13:18,920 --> 01:13:19,980
煮饭！
To cook!

988
01:13:21,420 --> 01:13:24,080
你明日第一次干，你小心些啊
Be careful tomorrow for your first time!

989
01:13:24,930 --> 01:13:26,760
我叫了阿哥看着你的啦！
My brother will take care of you!

990
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:29,850
我会小心！
I'll be careful!

991
01:13:31,030 --> 01:13:32,590
每一次阿哥出去干
whenever my brother commits a crime.

992
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:35,570
我都会担心到几个礼拜睡不着
I can't sleep for weeks!

993
01:13:36,140 --> 01:13:37,970
今次还要担心你
I have to worry about you too.

994
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:42,160
你要应承我，阿哥和你都不会有事的
Promise me you'll be alright!

995
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:10,530
臭婊子，打死你…！
Bad smell, go to hell...

996
01:14:10,670 --> 01:14:12,400
他无事呀？
Is he alright?

997
01:14:13,170 --> 01:14:14,140
无事的！
O.K.!

998
01:14:17,040 --> 01:14:18,100
你无事呀？
Something wrong with you?

999
01:14:19,480 --> 01:14:22,140
他每次做事前都是这样的了
He's like this every time!

1000
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:24,220
做好作战的心理准备
To be ready for the fight!

1001
01:14:25,050 --> 01:14:26,420
明日可以少个的
It's O.K. if we had one less.

1002
01:14:27,220 --> 01:14:30,450
不用担心，你不要看他这样
Don't worry, it will be O.K.!

1003
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:34,750
他临场好勇的，他花名叫丧军呀！
He is very brutal doing his job!

1004
01:14:35,230 --> 01:14:38,130
我东哥说什么，我就干什么，无两句的
I do whenever my brother tells me!

1005
01:14:38,230 --> 01:14:41,360
叫我死，我就即刻死，不会托手挣的
If he wants me dead, I'll kill myself!

1006
01:14:42,540 --> 01:14:45,870
看看，他真是又狼又丧，八万！
See, he is bloody mad, Pak Man!

1007
01:14:47,410 --> 01:14:48,970
九章啦，你还打！
Nine blocks already, be careful!

1008
01:14:53,710 --> 01:14:55,050
还未联络到他们！
Can't contact him!

1009
01:14:55,620 --> 01:15:00,550
你的意思是说他们三个
They have joined the gang!

1010
01:15:00,550 --> 01:15:02,820
现在已经同那班悍匪在一起

1011
01:15:02,820 --> 01:15:04,220
明日就去打劫
And they will go along with the project.

1012
01:15:04,220 --> 01:15:07,590
是，天光之前我会去目的地那里布防
we carry out our plan before dawn!

1013
01:15:08,800 --> 01:15:11,860
这三个在建联走出来的卧底
The three Kin-Luen bastards!

1014
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:14,400
明日和那班人一起中伏
will be trapped with the gang tomorrow.

1015
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:16,140
如果打起上来
If there was exchange of fire.

1016
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:19,200
在混乱之中他们好可能会有伤亡
would they be hurt too?

1017
01:15:19,270 --> 01:15:21,780
在一个小时之前所有负责行动的伙计
An hour ago, the special task force!

1018
01:15:21,780 --> 01:15:23,210
都收到他们三个的相
Have got their pictures!

1019
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:27,610
不过枪战起上来，很难说的！
But it's hard to say if it is chaotic!

1020
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:35,580
有一句说话，我只对你一个人说
I want to talk to you alone!

1021
01:15:36,090 --> 01:15:39,230
今晚在机场闯祸那家伙
About the incidence at the airport tonight.

1022
01:15:39,230 --> 01:15:41,690
已经证实了就是学军
It was done by Hok Kwan!

1023
01:15:42,460 --> 01:15:46,300
你的卧底计划根本是彻底失败
Your understand was a total failure.

1024
01:15:46,830 --> 01:15:48,430
在这一年来
In the past year, they had commit a lot of serious crime.

1025
01:15:48,570 --> 01:15:51,710
他们做了很多非常过份的事

1026
01:15:51,710 --> 01:15:54,000
如果这些事一旦穿了出去
In other words, if it got revealed.

1027
01:15:55,580 --> 01:15:59,540
我们警方就会受到所有舆论界的攻击
The police will be attacked by the media.

1028
01:15:59,750 --> 01:16:03,710
我和你的职位前途就即刻玩完
we don't have our future anymore.

1029
01:16:04,020 --> 01:16:07,120
幸好现在知道这个计划的人
Lucky only you and I know about it!

1030
01:16:07,120 --> 01:16:08,660
都还是很少

1031
01:16:08,660 --> 01:16:12,920
如果明日他们三个都被人打死了的话
If they all get killed tomorrow!

1032
01:16:13,790 --> 01:16:16,660
这样我们当这件事从来无发生过
Then nothing has ever happened!

1033
01:16:17,700 --> 01:16:20,030
你明白我的意思了吗？
Do you know what I mean?

1034
01:17:07,950 --> 01:17:08,710
你的！
Yours!

1035
01:17:13,990 --> 01:17:15,480
那两件是美国货来
They are from America!

1036
01:17:15,860 --> 01:17:17,720
这件是我自己用铜片做的
I made this out of copper!

1037
01:17:18,660 --> 01:17:20,330
虽然是重些，h些
It is a little bit heavy.

1038
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:22,390
不过普通的点三八点二二
Normal pistols can't make a hole on it.

1039
01:17:22,560 --> 01:17:23,690
都打不穿的

1040
01:17:25,270 --> 01:17:27,320
来，京生，你穿！
Come, King San, look!

1041
01:17:28,070 --> 01:17:29,540
我一向都不信这些东西
I don't trust this!

1042
01:17:29,970 --> 01:17:31,840
来啊，你是新人呀！
You are freshman, you wear it!

1043
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:43,470
他真是丧了！
Something wrong with him!

1044
01:19:22,350 --> 01:19:24,010
小姐，我们是差人
Miss, we're the police.

1045
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,250
想借你的阳台用一下，麻烦你开门！
Can we stay on the balcony!

1046
01:19:29,520 --> 01:19:30,620
无人在家啊
Nobody's home!

1047
01:19:30,990 --> 01:19:32,390
我们是特别行动组的
we're special task force!

1048
01:19:32,390 --> 01:19:33,330
想借你的阳台
we wanna stay on the balcony...

1049
01:19:33,330 --> 01:19:34,730
监视对面间银行
to keep an eye on the bank!

1050
01:19:36,200 --> 01:19:38,320
我阿妈去了买菜，我拿不到主意的
My mum is out, can't let you in!

1051
01:19:38,600 --> 01:19:40,500
有人想打劫对面间银行
I wish that you can help, it's fatal!

1052
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:41,660
麻烦你帮帮手
I am a woman, not convenient!

1053
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,270
我一个女人，不方便的！

1054
01:19:45,070 --> 01:19:46,730
不用了，隔壁那间搞定了
Next door would be O.K.

1055
01:19:55,250 --> 01:19:57,180
无可能的！无可能的！
Impossible!

1056
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:05,430
上晚机场发生袭警开枪事件
A police was attacked at the airport.

1057
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:07,360
一个持假护照离境的嫌疑犯

1058
01:20:07,360 --> 01:20:08,660
抢走警员佩枪
Snatched the police pistol and hurting a man.

1059
01:20:08,660 --> 01:20:10,690
并枪伤一名中国籍男子

1060
01:20:11,500 --> 01:20:14,660
事后该名男子在医院接受记者的访问
Our reporter has interviewed the two victims.

1061
01:20:15,240 --> 01:20:18,110
是他，就是他了，是他抢我的钱
It's him, he has robbed my money!

1062
01:20:18,110 --> 01:20:20,470
他是大陆差人，他是大陆差人来的
He is a cop from China!

1063
01:20:20,470 --> 01:20:21,910
是他自己说给我听的
He said he was a Chinese policeman.

1064
01:20:22,810 --> 01:20:24,280
那个人说自己是大陆差人
He said he was a Chinese policeman.

1065
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:25,610
现在替警方办事
Now working as an informer.

1066
01:20:25,680 --> 01:20:26,580
警方怎说？
what did the police respond?

1067
01:20:26,580 --> 01:20:29,210
警方说根本无这回事，但是我就不信
They deny it, but I don't believe them!

1068
01:20:29,350 --> 01:20:31,080
他们根本无通缉他的
The police is not trying to catch him.

1069
01:20:31,420 --> 01:20:32,590
那些差人帮着他
He is at large and can always threaten me!

1070
01:20:32,590 --> 01:20:34,020
难保他又再开枪打我的
I want 24 hours protection from the police.

1071
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:35,780
我要求警方二十四小时保护我

1072
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:38,320
大陆差人？
Police from China?

1073
01:20:38,490 --> 01:20:40,120
是他们杀死了大江那几兄弟
You killed the Kwong brothers.

1074
01:20:40,630 --> 01:20:42,790
学军，打火机是他们手上
Hok Kwan, they have the lighter.

1075
01:20:42,960 --> 01:20:44,400
大大是他们杀死的
They killed Biggy!

1076
01:21:06,620 --> 01:21:07,350
开门…！
Open the door...what's happening inside?

1077
01:21:07,350 --> 01:21:08,250
什么事呀？

1078
01:21:15,400 --> 01:21:18,930
东哥…你怎样？
Tung, are you alright?

1079
01:21:18,930 --> 01:21:19,760
看着学军！
Look Hok Kwan!

1080
01:21:22,800 --> 01:21:24,860
你即刻带两班伙计上去
Send someone to search the top!

1081
01:22:58,970 --> 01:22:59,560
学军！
Hok Kwan!

1082
01:23:22,290 --> 01:23:23,360
阿虎…！
Ah Fu...!

1083
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:26,290
你…你出卖我！
You betrayed me!

1084
01:23:36,040 --> 01:23:41,910
京生，京生…！
King San...!

1085
01:24:25,120 --> 01:24:25,810
别动！
Don't move!

1086
01:25:09,960 --> 01:25:11,160
巷里面的人听着
The ones in the alley, you have 3 minutes!

1087
01:25:11,160 --> 01:25:14,290
我们现在给三分钟你弃械投降

1088
01:25:14,530 --> 01:25:17,000
如不答应，我们就会使用武力
Drop your weapons or I forced out!

1089
01:25:27,980 --> 01:25:29,280
程Sir，他们出来了
Sir, they are coming out!

1090
01:25:32,990 --> 01:25:35,010
不要开枪啊…！
Don't shoot!

1091
01:25:35,320 --> 01:25:38,020
谁个开枪的，我就打死这个差佬先了！
I'll kill him whoever fires!

1092
01:25:40,830 --> 01:25:41,990
我是郭学军
I am Hok Kwan!

1093
01:25:42,060 --> 01:25:44,430
程Sir在不在这里？我要见程Sir！
Is Mr. Ching here? I wanna see him!

1094
01:25:49,470 --> 01:25:51,330
退后啊，听不听到啊？
Move back, did you hear me?

1095
01:25:51,370 --> 01:25:52,740
我最多和他揽着一齐死
Or we die together!

1096
01:26:01,850 --> 01:26:02,640
开火！
Fire!

1097
01:26:15,660 --> 01:26:16,630
姓程的！
Mr. Ching.

1098
01:26:25,740 --> 01:26:28,730
你们不要过来，叫他们退后二十码
Don't come over, move back 20 yards.

1099
01:26:32,710 --> 01:26:35,340
退后二十码，这是命令！
Move back 20 yards, it's an order!

1100
01:26:39,190 --> 01:26:40,420
你出卖我们？
You betrayed us?

1101
01:26:40,420 --> 01:26:42,460
你开枪就会给人打到像蜜蜂窝似的
If you fire, you get shot!

1102
01:26:42,460 --> 01:26:43,650
我预了啦！
I don't care!

1103
01:26:46,630 --> 01:26:47,650
你杀我无用的！
It's no use killing me!

1104
01:26:47,830 --> 01:26:49,450
杀学军不是我的意思
It's not my idea to kill Hok Kwan.

1105
01:26:49,500 --> 01:26:52,260
我是照命令做，我都不赞成
It was an order, I didn't agree.

1106
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:53,370
我和他们辩到面红耳绿
I had argued with them, but they wouldn't listen.

1107
01:26:53,370 --> 01:26:54,360
他们都是不接受
Your were a soldier, you should understand.

1108
01:26:54,770 --> 01:26:56,000
你当过兵的

1109
01:26:56,100 --> 01:26:58,300
你应该明白下级服从上司的命令

1110
01:26:58,340 --> 01:26:59,600
是无可奈何的
The lower ranks have to obey all the time.

1111
01:26:59,810 --> 01:27:01,770
而且学军上晚在机场里面
And Hok Kwan made such a big mess...

1112
01:27:01,910 --> 01:27:03,380
弄这么大件事出来
he was surely sentenced to death.

1113
01:27:03,640 --> 01:27:05,910
他等于一个已经判了刑的死囚

1114
01:27:06,650 --> 01:27:09,710
而且牺牲了他，我才有弯转余地
To sacrifice him, I've got an alternative.

1115
01:27:10,380 --> 01:27:12,110
我这样做才可以帮到你
Then I can help you!

1116
01:27:12,320 --> 01:27:16,020
李向东，你相信我，我保证你无事
Li Heung Tung, trust me! I promise you be alright!

1117
01:27:16,690 --> 01:27:18,280
就算是上级的命令
That's an order, but don't have to obey!

1118
01:27:18,660 --> 01:27:20,320
亦未必一定要服从

1119
01:27:20,890 --> 01:27:23,330
如果上级要我杀一群无辜的妇孺
If I was ordered to kill a kid!

1120
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:25,390
我是绝对不会接受
I won't obey!

1121
01:27:26,030 --> 01:27:27,830
我要问过我自己的良心先
I am conscientious!

1122
01:27:28,870 --> 01:27:30,200
你下令开火
You gave the order, so you are responsible!

1123
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:32,610
你就要对这件事负责任

1124
01:27:32,810 --> 01:27:35,410
李向东，你想不想在这里居留呀？
Li Heung Tung, do you want to stay?

1125
01:27:35,410 --> 01:27:38,210
你不要再骗我，你说的话我不会听
Don't lie to me, I won't trust you!

1126
01:27:38,580 --> 01:27:40,600
我们三个人偷渡出来时候
what did we say when sneaking in...

1127
01:27:40,810 --> 01:27:42,840
曾经说过同生共死

1128
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:45,210
生，一齐生，死，一齐死！
to live and die together!

1129
01:27:46,020 --> 01:27:46,820
再见
Goodbye!
