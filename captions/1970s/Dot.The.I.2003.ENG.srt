00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:51,260
Carmen, I don't want you to go back.

2
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,199
I'm not going back.

3
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:55,835
Good.

4
00:02:57,577 --> 00:02:59,408
I'm never going back.

5
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:09,045
Marry me, Carmen.

6
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,816
What?

7
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,092
Marry me.

8
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:21,364
Barnaby...

9
00:03:21,868 --> 00:03:24,393
- we've known each other for...
- Six months.

10
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:28,998
- Five.
- And a half. So what?

11
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:33,177
So what, Carmen?
I've never been so sure of anything.

12
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,047
I've never been so happy as since 
I met you.

13
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:45,053
Just promise me
you'll think about it. Please?

14
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:16,115
I'm afraid we are fully booked.
Another time, no doubt.

15
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,255
I'd like to propose a toast to Carmen...

16
00:04:20,326 --> 00:04:23,887
who's gonna be the blushing bride
to her sexy new husband.

17
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:25,726
Cheers.

18
00:04:26,966 --> 00:04:29,264
- Put it on automatic.
- I don't want to.

19
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,462
Just put it on automatic,
because it does it for you.

20
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:34,938
That's videotaping, not filmmaking.
I'm a filmmaker, not a videotaper.

21
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,476
Yeah, give me the fucking camera.
Put it on automatic...

22
00:04:37,543 --> 00:04:40,171
because it does it for you. Dick.

23
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,347
- Messieurs, bonsoir.
- Bonsoir.

24
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,018
We have a table.

25
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,851
- Under what name, monsieur?
- Kit Winter.

26
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,317
Yes.

27
00:04:54,861 --> 00:04:57,728
Gentlemen, I'm afraid there has been
a little mix-up.

28
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,061
Would you mind sharing a table?

29
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,192
- Fuck's sake.
- No, we don't mind.

30
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:05,499
- Which table?
- That one, monsieur.

31
00:05:06,939 --> 00:05:08,463
We'll take it.

32
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,856
Are you all right?

33
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:31,161
- Lesbians.
- What?

34
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,628
Lesbians.

35
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,300
Shut the fuck up, Theo.

36
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:39,065
I mean, hey, whatever floats your boat.

37
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:45,709
Oh, no.

38
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:48,847
It's a French tradition. You have to do it.

39
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:51,975
It's a French restaurant, French tradition.
It'll bring you luck.

40
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:54,576
- What's he talking about?
- I don't know.

41
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,679
- Go on.
- Okay.

42
00:06:00,426 --> 00:06:02,121
Mesdames et messieurs...

43
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:05,026
these ladies are celebrating a hen night.

44
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:07,563
In France, we have a tradition.

45
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:11,660
The bride-to-be must choose a man
for one last kiss.

46
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:14,562
A farewell to her single life.

47
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:22,307
- Not him.
- Check them out down here.

48
00:06:40,166 --> 00:06:43,465
Mesdames et messieurs,
the bride-to-be has chosen...

49
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:46,867
monsieur.

50
00:06:55,882 --> 00:06:57,213
Here goes.

51
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:10,687
Excuse me. Sorry.

52
00:09:11,784 --> 00:09:12,978
Bravo!

53
00:09:49,855 --> 00:09:52,255
So, this guy in the restaurant...

54
00:09:53,793 --> 00:09:55,818
- was he bothering you?
- No.

55
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,920
- He was...
- Did you hit him?

56
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,866
You hit him, didn't you?

57
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:04,932
Oh, that's beautiful.

58
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:10,705
You know, your temper is gonna get you
into serious trouble one of these days.

59
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,443
No, I've got it.

60
00:10:21,687 --> 00:10:25,054
You know, it's amazing what they can 
do with skin grafts now.

61
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:33,561
I'm sorry.

62
00:10:54,687 --> 00:10:57,451
- Maybe they'd like to join us.
- Oh, yeah.

63
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:07,563
I told you I'll be back.
You can't hide from me.

64
00:11:07,633 --> 00:11:10,761
Like, you can't say I'm not a fair man.
I gave you two months...

65
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:13,669
Now look, I told you.
Now get your things and out.

66
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,483
Where did you get this?

67
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:31,287
Are you...

68
00:11:32,758 --> 00:11:34,020
dealing drugs?

69
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:09,119
Yes?

70
00:12:10,429 --> 00:12:12,294
That French tradition?

71
00:12:13,265 --> 00:12:15,096
I was thinking that...

72
00:12:15,167 --> 00:12:18,398
Hey, where do you think you're going?
It's not your break.

73
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:21,497
Oy, you can't come back here.
Are you listening to me?

74
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:33,848
- Overreacting a little, aren't we?
- How did you find me?

75
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,047
Your friends at the restaurant,
they told me where you worked.

76
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:40,092
- I should get back.
- What, the burgers will get cold?

77
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:45,053
Have you been wondering?

78
00:12:45,731 --> 00:12:48,029
Or do you kiss like that all the time?

79
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:51,428
I've been wondering.

80
00:12:51,504 --> 00:12:55,031
I'm getting married, okay?
That's why I was having that...

81
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,665
chicken thing.

82
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:00,368
Hen night. It's called a hen night.

83
00:13:01,413 --> 00:13:02,573
I'm getting married.

84
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:06,140
Okay, then he gets to see you for the 
rest of his life.

85
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:09,583
What harm is there if you see me 
just once?

86
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:12,651
Would you like to see me beg?

87
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:15,622
Believe me, 
I'm no stranger to humiliation.

88
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:16,752
Get up.

89
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,922
- A coffee.
- No.

90
00:13:18,998 --> 00:13:21,592
One glass of water.
In a brightly-lit public place.

91
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:22,656
No.

92
00:13:22,735 --> 00:13:24,669
Okay, we don't even have to talk 
to each other.

93
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:26,500
- We don't even have to sit together.
- No.

94
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:28,733
You sit on one side of the room
and I sit on the other.

95
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,469
- No.
- And if everything goes really well...

96
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:33,171
we'll just wave to each other once 
in a while.

97
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:37,310
Why are you filming this?

98
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:41,050
- Just in case I never see you again.
- Which you won't.

99
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,747
Did you bone her?

100
00:13:44,423 --> 00:13:45,754
Take me off speakerphone.

101
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,520
He didn't bone it.

102
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:51,220
Tell me you got her number, at least.

103
00:13:51,297 --> 00:13:54,460
- She wouldn't give it to me.
- So what did you do?

104
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,390
She agreed to meet me.

105
00:13:56,468 --> 00:13:58,231
Hey, result.

106
00:13:58,904 --> 00:14:00,030
When?

107
00:14:37,176 --> 00:14:38,336
Hello?

108
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:05,202
- Are you sure there was someone there?
- Yes.

109
00:15:05,537 --> 00:15:08,005
- Following you?
- Yes. I...

110
00:15:10,843 --> 00:15:12,310
I don't know.

111
00:15:12,611 --> 00:15:16,707
Carmen, there's nothing to be scared of.
I won't let anything happen to you.

112
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,316
But what if it was him?

113
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,515
How could it be?

114
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:27,223
Think about it, Carmen.
There's no way he could find you here.

115
00:15:27,293 --> 00:15:28,817
Well, he found me before.

116
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,954
That was Madrid.
You're in another country now.

117
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:35,094
You don't know him.

118
00:15:37,336 --> 00:15:39,804
Maybe it was that guy from the hen night.

119
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:42,632
What?

120
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,302
- No, I don't think so.
- Well, how do you know?

121
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:50,379
Because...

122
00:15:53,018 --> 00:15:54,781
Maybe it was no one.

123
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:59,252
Maybe I imagined it.

124
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,734
Carmen, I...

125
00:16:13,739 --> 00:16:15,730
I booked the registry office.

126
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,744
- What?
- They had a cancellation. Next Saturday.

127
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,780
Next Saturday?

128
00:16:24,783 --> 00:16:26,774
Did I do the wrong thing?

129
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:32,818
- I can call them in the morning and cancel.
- No, don't.

130
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:37,057
I want to marry you.

131
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:39,726
I do.

132
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:11,185
Any more caffeine, they'd be peeling me...

133
00:17:11,697 --> 00:17:13,187
Oh, shit.

134
00:17:13,832 --> 00:17:15,356
What the fuck?

135
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,533
Why are you following me?

136
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:28,810
I thought you might like to explain
what the hell that was all about.

137
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:31,479
Well, this is a nice date.
I'm having a nice time.

138
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,744
This is not a date.

139
00:17:32,818 --> 00:17:34,911
I only showed up to tell you you're 
a son of a bitch.

140
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:38,616
- Well, at least we connected.
- I lost my job because of you.

141
00:17:38,690 --> 00:17:40,658
Is that what this is all about?

142
00:17:40,726 --> 00:17:43,194
You lost your job? 
Flipping burgers?

143
00:17:44,696 --> 00:17:45,958
Fuck you.

144
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:50,200
What do you do
that makes you so high and mighty?

145
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,674
I'm an actor.

146
00:17:58,210 --> 00:17:59,677
Unemployed...

147
00:18:02,147 --> 00:18:03,808
most of the time.

148
00:18:03,882 --> 00:18:06,350
In fact, I do unemployment really well.

149
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,648
You know, maybe I should just
stop pretending...

150
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,813
and start flipping burgers.

151
00:18:11,156 --> 00:18:14,819
Why don't you tell me about the fries
and the pickles and the buns?

152
00:18:16,728 --> 00:18:20,596
Look, you're here and I'm bleeding.

153
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:23,725
I know this great chemist.

154
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:35,869
Thanks.

155
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,051
Thank you.

156
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,622
There.

157
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,328
Thanks.

158
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:04,005
Are you hungry?

159
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:28,090
Hi, this is 7031.
Can I get something to eat?

160
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,806
So how do you know about this place?

161
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:53,782
How many jobs have you been 
fired from?

162
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,087
Exactly?

163
00:19:56,161 --> 00:19:57,651
Thirty-five...

164
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,592
in six months.

165
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,257
- I have a temper.
- Yeah, I noticed. Yeah.

166
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:08,265
- Sorry about that.
- That's okay.

167
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:12,170
- Where are you from?
- Madrid. You?

168
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,569
Rio. Brazil.

169
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:17,945
- Yeah?
- Yeah, but my dad's English.

170
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,818
So I came here when I was...

171
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,410
What the hell are you...

172
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:23,681
Carmen!

173
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:43,197
Get off me, you fat, fucking asshole.

174
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,774
You're back.

175
00:20:45,811 --> 00:20:48,939
- What is it this time?
- Two steaks, two apple pies.

176
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:50,311
Entertaining, were we?

177
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:53,010
- And one bottle of Campo Viejo.
- Viejo.

178
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:55,312
1996.

179
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:57,650
Commendable choice.

180
00:20:59,524 --> 00:21:02,118
Fiona, get me Sgt. Davies, would you?

181
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:25,106
What the blazes now? Stay there.

182
00:21:27,152 --> 00:21:28,813
Keep left, please.

183
00:21:29,821 --> 00:21:32,255
Please use the left-hand door.

184
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:35,854
Please use the door on the left.

185
00:21:35,927 --> 00:21:36,916
Carmen.

186
00:21:37,729 --> 00:21:39,856
Not through the revolving... 
Hey!

187
00:22:24,209 --> 00:22:25,574
Stop.

188
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:36,220
- Here.
- Thanks.

189
00:22:42,694 --> 00:22:44,821
I didn't ask for your help.

190
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:47,465
- I know.
- Didn't ask.

191
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:49,559
No.

192
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:00,875
Your coat.

193
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,647
At the hotel.

194
00:23:49,194 --> 00:23:50,684
It's a saying:

195
00:23:52,564 --> 00:23:53,895
"A kiss...

196
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:58,458
"is to dot the 'I'...

197
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,602
"on the word 'love."'

198
00:24:06,311 --> 00:24:08,211
Yeah, but there's no "I" in "love."

199
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,440
Well...

200
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:14,713
then I guess it doesn't work in English,
does it?

201
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:23,960
I better go.

202
00:24:29,434 --> 00:24:30,628
Bye.

203
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:55,189
Barnaby. You scared me.

204
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,791
Nice coat.

205
00:24:59,197 --> 00:25:01,791
- It's a friend's.
- Where's yours?

206
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:07,132
At work. I left it at work.

207
00:25:11,743 --> 00:25:13,768
Well, let's go and get it.

208
00:25:15,247 --> 00:25:18,148
Barnaby, what's the matter?

209
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:23,119
- Come on, let's go and get your coat.
- Barnaby, stop it.

210
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:26,419
- You need a coat. Everyone needs a coat.
- What's going on?

211
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:30,492
I called you at work.

212
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:34,557
What?

213
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,532
They told me you'd been fired.

214
00:25:40,939 --> 00:25:43,066
You were checking up on me?

215
00:25:45,010 --> 00:25:47,740
I was worried about you being followed.

216
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:51,442
Or did you make that up, too?

217
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,620
I don't know if I can do this.

218
00:26:05,697 --> 00:26:06,857
You know what Ford said.

219
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:09,400
Yeah, I don't give a flying fuck
what Ford said.

220
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:11,196
I don't see what the big deal is anyway.

221
00:26:11,269 --> 00:26:13,635
The big deal, Theo...

222
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:18,698
- What's that?
- Shit. It's my landlord.

223
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:21,069
- I've gotta go. Bye.
- Kit...

224
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:26,976
Asshole.

225
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:32,214
Carmen?

226
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:36,483
How did you find me?

227
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:48,530
Thanks. Did you pay it?

228
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:51,999
Please come in.

229
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:58,644
Reminds me of home.

230
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:06,385
- Is this your father?
- Yeah.

231
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,518
He used to be a soap star.

232
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:12,730
- Where is he now?
- He...

233
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:18,631
He's...

234
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:23,263
Well, I just came to give you your coat.

235
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,799
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

236
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,271
Wait.

237
00:27:29,748 --> 00:27:32,239
I've still got that wine that you gave me.

238
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,423
My father drank his wine out of mugs.

239
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,792
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

240
00:27:44,863 --> 00:27:47,161
Mine took it straight from the bottle.

241
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:49,723
He didn't want anything getting in 
the way.

242
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:57,172
- No, don't.
- Yes. Just a little.

243
00:27:57,242 --> 00:27:58,368
No.

244
00:27:59,678 --> 00:28:03,671
- Why do you have to film everything?
- 'Cause moments don't last.

245
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,346
They're not meant to.

246
00:28:06,718 --> 00:28:09,278
Look, I wanna remember you when 
you're gone...

247
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,982
and I'm married to this blond girl,
you know...

248
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:15,458
and she's very rich,
and I'm full of regret because of...

249
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,325
- I don't know, just tell me something.
- What?

250
00:28:19,030 --> 00:28:21,624
Anything. How did you meet your fiancé?

251
00:28:23,001 --> 00:28:25,993
I dance sometimes at this club.

252
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:28,133
They don't pay much, but...

253
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:31,198
Anyway, Barnaby came in one night.

254
00:28:34,345 --> 00:28:35,710
What does he do?

255
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,509
Nothing, not really. He is...

256
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:42,842
- I mean...
- Born with a silver spoon?

257
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,356
- What?
- Rich.

258
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:51,959
Yeah. A big spoon.

259
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:55,459
Then why are you so worried
about working?

260
00:28:55,533 --> 00:28:57,797
Because I like to earn my own money.

261
00:28:57,869 --> 00:29:00,201
- Is that okay for you?
- Yes.

262
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:03,465
- You think I'm marrying him for his money.
- No.

263
00:29:05,443 --> 00:29:08,276
Better, 'cause I'm not.

264
00:29:08,346 --> 00:29:09,335
Okay.

265
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:12,043
My turn.

266
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,120
What happened to your father?

267
00:29:23,728 --> 00:29:24,956
He...

268
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:31,165
- If you don't want to talk about it...
- No, it's okay.

269
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:32,863
He killed himself.

270
00:29:34,906 --> 00:29:36,134
Sorry.

271
00:29:36,975 --> 00:29:40,411
He did something that he couldn't 
live with...

272
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:43,539
and that's why he came here.

273
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:48,651
And what...

274
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:52,885
Sorry, what happened here?

275
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,229
You don't want to know.

276
00:30:03,735 --> 00:30:06,033
But it's why you left Madrid.

277
00:30:09,307 --> 00:30:11,207
And it's probably why you're marrying 
Barnaby.

278
00:30:11,276 --> 00:30:13,972
I'm marrying Barnaby because 
I love him.

279
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,573
Then why are you here?

280
00:32:04,555 --> 00:32:05,647
Yes?

281
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:13,624
- Hi.
- What are you doing here?

282
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,228
- Have you been following me?
- No.

283
00:32:19,304 --> 00:32:21,704
Your friends at the hen night...

284
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:25,139
They have a big mouth.

285
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:29,741
I brought you this.

286
00:32:35,186 --> 00:32:36,619
I meant to give it to you earlier.

287
00:32:38,189 --> 00:32:39,178
I hope you like it.

288
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:44,286
What?

289
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:48,488
This is my favorite book.

290
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:55,169
I have to get changed.

291
00:33:04,248 --> 00:33:06,546
- I'll wait outside, okay?
- Yeah.

292
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,643
- Bye.
- Bye.

293
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:30,601
Carmen.

294
00:33:45,990 --> 00:33:49,756
And there was me thinking that you were
trying to run away from me again.

295
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:53,422
Kit, I like you, really...

296
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:57,097
but I don't want to fuck up what I 
have with Barnaby.

297
00:33:57,468 --> 00:33:59,333
I'm getting married...

298
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:01,704
on Saturday.

299
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:03,368
This Saturday?

300
00:34:12,517 --> 00:34:14,781
I've had enough trouble for one life.

301
00:34:16,354 --> 00:34:17,844
Don't make any more.

302
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:29,793
Carmen.

303
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:44,014
Are you okay?

304
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:01,865
What do I do?

305
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:03,693
Are you going to eat that, Kit?

306
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:07,204
Theo, will you stop thinking about
your fucking stomach for one moment?

307
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:09,102
I mean, 
he's trying to make a decision here.

308
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:10,299
Sorry.

309
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:12,943
- You're in deep.
- I know.

310
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:16,704
- Well, that's good.
- That's good? How's that good?

311
00:35:17,682 --> 00:35:21,049
- Theo, tell me, how's that good?
- Well, 'cause, you know...

312
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:25,914
Well, you knew she was getting married
when you met her.

313
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,218
- I know.
- He's right.

314
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,849
I know he's right. I know.

315
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:31,895
I know, maybe I should just leave her be.
I don't...

316
00:35:33,664 --> 00:35:36,963
No, wait. I mean, think about it.

317
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:39,735
What if she is the one?

318
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:43,433
I mean, are you prepared to risk
the possibility of settling for second best...

319
00:35:43,508 --> 00:35:45,373
somewhere down the line?

320
00:35:45,443 --> 00:35:47,104
Oh, no, I've seen this one.

321
00:35:47,178 --> 00:35:49,510
I've seen this one.
No, 'cause you do a Graduate.

322
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,548
- A what?
- A Graduate. You know...

323
00:35:51,616 --> 00:35:55,074
turn up at the wedding,
and if she runs off with you...

324
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:57,914
there you have it.
You gonna eat that? Can I...

325
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,617
Theo, for Christ's sake, life is not 
a movie.

326
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:04,560
Yeah, it is.

327
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:08,127
Come on, whatever you say, whatever
you do, movies always got there first.

328
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:10,827
Even that line you just said comes 
from a movie.

329
00:36:10,902 --> 00:36:14,338
Kevin Spacey in 
the end of Swimming With Sharks.

330
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:17,602
"Because life is not a movie.

331
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:21,668
"Everyone lies. Good guys lose.

332
00:36:21,746 --> 00:36:25,409
"And love does not conquer all."

333
00:36:27,985 --> 00:36:29,816
Are you gonna eat that, Kit?

334
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,522
Not those.

335
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,775
Carmen, I wanted to say I'm sorry
for not trusting you.

336
00:37:01,919 --> 00:37:04,353
I'm gonna try not to be jealous...

337
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:06,647
or possessive, because...

338
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:11,719
- I know how you hate that.
- That guy from the hen night...

339
00:37:11,796 --> 00:37:14,993
- You don't have to explain anything.
- No, I want to.

340
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:20,361
He came to the burger bar.
He is the reason I got fired.

341
00:37:21,372 --> 00:37:23,340
And I did see him again.

342
00:37:24,008 --> 00:37:26,499
But I don't want to see him anymore.

343
00:37:31,215 --> 00:37:32,773
You want to postpone, don't you?

344
00:37:32,850 --> 00:37:35,284
- No, I didn't say that.
- It's okay.

345
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,715
- I know you have your doubts.
- I don't.

346
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,154
Look, I'm gonna check into a hotel 
tomorrow...

347
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:44,387
- until Saturday.
- Why?

348
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:47,627
Because I want you to have room 
to think...

349
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:50,058
to make the right decision.

350
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,795
I really love you, Carmen.

351
00:37:55,373 --> 00:37:58,740
And I swear I'll do anything I can
to make you happy.

352
00:41:54,778 --> 00:41:57,975
Marriage, according to the law
of this country...

353
00:41:58,048 --> 00:42:00,983
is a union between one man with 
one woman...

354
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:03,610
voluntarily entered into for life...

355
00:42:04,121 --> 00:42:06,487
and to the exclusion of all others.

356
00:42:06,557 --> 00:42:08,821
It is solemn and it is binding.

357
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:11,185
"Do you, Barnaby Caspian...

358
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:15,028
"take Carmen Colazzo
to be your lawfully wedded wife...

359
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:17,567
"to have and to hold from this day 
forward...

360
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:20,661
"for richer, for poorer, in sickness 
and in health...

361
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:23,337
"as long as you both shall live?"

362
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:27,799
I do.

363
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:34,407
"And do you, Carmen Colazzo...

364
00:42:34,485 --> 00:42:38,353
"take Barnaby Caspian
to be your lawfully wedded husband...

365
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:41,948
"to have and to hold from this day 
forward...

366
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:44,754
"for richer, for poorer...

367
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,725
"in sickness and in health...

368
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:50,289
"for as long as you both shall live?"

369
00:43:03,447 --> 00:43:04,573
I do.

370
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:33,274
- Hi.
- Looking for someone?

371
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:36,142
- Yeah, this couple getting married.
- How unusual.

372
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,912
- Spanish girl?
- Yes. That's her.

373
00:43:39,817 --> 00:43:41,785
She looked so beautiful.

374
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:44,245
You're too late.

375
00:43:48,125 --> 00:43:50,150
Carmen, wait!

376
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:55,356
Wait!

377
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,260
Double glazing, it's a bitch.

378
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:24,317
Born with a silver spoon?

379
00:44:25,095 --> 00:44:27,086
- What?
- Rich.

380
00:44:29,299 --> 00:44:33,133
Yeah. A big spoon.

381
00:44:35,139 --> 00:44:37,937
Then why are you so worried
about working?

382
00:44:38,876 --> 00:44:40,707
Because I like to earn my own money.

383
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:42,575
Is that okay for you?

384
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:46,072
- You think I'm marrying him for his money.
- No.

385
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,584
Better, 'cause I'm not.

386
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:55,321
But it's why you left Madrid.

387
00:44:58,095 --> 00:45:01,121
And it's probably why you're 
marrying Barnaby.

388
00:45:07,304 --> 00:45:10,432
I have got a little surprise for you.

389
00:45:13,343 --> 00:45:17,677
One Caribbean cruise for two, 
first-class.

390
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:22,180
- Barnaby.
- I know.

391
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,582
I couldn't resist.

392
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:28,391
I want to spoil my wife.

393
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:33,156
We could look a little happier.
They cost a small fortune.

394
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:40,868
I don't know
if I want to go away right now.

395
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:43,605
Sorry, what?

396
00:45:45,275 --> 00:45:46,799
Nothing, I...

397
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:54,180
- You surprised me.
- Carmen, we just got married!

398
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:55,646
I'm fine.

399
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:59,183
Well, if you're fine, then that's fine.

400
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:01,791
Fine. Fine. Fine

401
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:14,234
Carmen, I paid a lot of money for 
decent wine glasses.

402
00:46:15,539 --> 00:46:17,404
Please use them.

403
00:47:13,964 --> 00:47:15,431
I got married.

404
00:47:39,156 --> 00:47:40,555
Dot the "I."

405
00:47:44,761 --> 00:47:46,991
See? It does work in English.

406
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:26,950
Carmen?

407
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:29,483
Yes?

408
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:43,871
There's something that I have to tell you.

409
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:00,549
Something that...

410
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:03,988
That's not very...

411
00:51:17,974 --> 00:51:19,464
I lied to you.

412
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:52,704
My friends never told you where I 
worked, did they?

413
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:59,808
- No.
- Then it was you, wasn't it? Following me?

414
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:02,242
No.

415
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:08,614
Oh, Jesus, not again.

416
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:12,119
What are you talking about?

417
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:16,061
I can't believe I'm doing this to Barnaby.
He's been nothing but good to me.

418
00:52:16,133 --> 00:52:18,533
But you can't be with someone just 
because they're good to you.

419
00:52:18,602 --> 00:52:21,969
- Really? And why not?
- Well, no, because you need...

420
00:52:23,907 --> 00:52:26,171
- Because you need passion, I think...
- Passion?

421
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:27,335
Yeah.

422
00:52:28,812 --> 00:52:31,110
Don't talk to me about passion.

423
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,879
I've tried passion.

424
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:38,850
Passion for people who don't deserve it...

425
00:52:38,922 --> 00:52:41,891
for people who cause me pain.

426
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:46,293
I've followed my heart before.

427
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:49,557
You want to see what I got?

428
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,543
I wanted to leave.

429
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:09,447
He had...

430
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:12,619
other ideas.

431
00:53:15,825 --> 00:53:17,156
I'm sorry.

432
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:22,162
I thought he found me.

433
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:24,995
That he was here...

434
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,065
following me like he used to.

435
00:53:30,974 --> 00:53:33,169
Hiding in the shadows, but...

436
00:53:34,644 --> 00:53:37,112
- it was you.
- No.

437
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,372
No, it wasn't.

438
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:42,511
Carmen, wait!

439
00:54:11,281 --> 00:54:13,010
Barnaby, I'm sorry.

440
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:20,687
I know I fucked up, and you don't 
deserve it.

441
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:27,695
But I want you to know it's over.

442
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,265
I don't want to fuck up anymore.

443
00:54:38,475 --> 00:54:39,703
Barnaby.

444
00:54:41,845 --> 00:54:43,005
Leave.

445
00:54:44,481 --> 00:54:47,211
- Please.
- Just leave, before I...

446
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,548
- I'm not going to...
- Get out!

447
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:52,913
Okay.

448
00:55:20,116 --> 00:55:22,243
I hope this thing's working.

449
00:55:27,857 --> 00:55:31,122
You know, everyone thinks that I've 
got everything.

450
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,424
What have I got?

451
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:44,999
A nice home, money.

452
00:55:50,613 --> 00:55:52,012
I haven't got you.

453
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:57,215
I mean, I never did.

454
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:04,354
And without you...

455
00:56:10,900 --> 00:56:13,698
Some people say this is the easy way out.

456
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:23,509
It's taking more courage
than anything I've ever done before.

457
00:56:28,184 --> 00:56:30,152
Look at me, I'm shaking.

458
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:37,359
The camera never lies, even when it 
deceives.

459
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:43,095
This is what I've chosen to do.

460
00:56:45,101 --> 00:56:46,432
I love you.

461
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:46,356
Excuse me, 
miss, you can't come in here.

462
00:57:48,097 --> 00:57:49,496
Where is he?

463
00:57:56,506 --> 00:57:58,167
I'm so very sorry.

464
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:05,212
Take that fucking camera out of my face!

465
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:19,391
Kit!

466
00:58:22,098 --> 00:58:25,534
- Carmen. What happened?
- He's dead.

467
00:58:25,602 --> 00:58:27,365
- What?
- I killed him.

468
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:31,440
Barnaby. He's dead.
I killed him. He shot himself.

469
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:33,567
- Oh, Jesus, no.
- I got to call about his ambulance.

470
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:35,975
- Fuck. What have I done?
- It's not your fault!

471
00:58:36,045 --> 00:58:39,071
Don't you see?
It is my fault, Carmen. I've gotta call Ford.

472
00:58:39,148 --> 00:58:42,709
I've got to tell him what's happened.
It's gotta stop right away.

473
00:58:43,119 --> 00:58:45,747
- Who's Ford?
- Why did I do it? Fuck!

474
00:58:46,289 --> 00:58:47,881
What's going on?

475
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:50,856
Carmen, I'm so sorry.

476
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,055
What?

477
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:59,029
What the fuck is going on here?

478
00:58:59,102 --> 00:59:02,162
I knew it was wrong
right from the start. Okay?

479
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:04,664
I needed the money.

480
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:07,835
- Kit, you're scaring me.
- I wanted to tell you.

481
00:59:08,077 --> 00:59:10,978
I wanted to tell you before, but I just...

482
00:59:12,181 --> 00:59:13,648
Tell me what?

483
00:59:15,151 --> 00:59:18,552
Kit? Fuck. Tell me what?

484
01:00:21,250 --> 01:00:24,151
I'm Kit. Kit Winter.

485
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:29,189
- Ford.
- Ford?

486
01:00:33,997 --> 01:00:36,022
- This is Tom and Theo.
- Hi.

487
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,298
- Hi.
- Johnny Handsome.

488
01:00:39,769 --> 01:00:41,293
My assistants.

489
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:45,074
- Let me take your coat.
- Thanks.

490
01:00:58,054 --> 01:01:00,318
We're not actually his assistants.

491
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:03,188
That's just one of Ford's little jokes.

492
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:05,523
No. Yeah, 'cause we're the producers.

493
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:12,695
...letting Ford direct, you know.

494
01:01:12,769 --> 01:01:16,466
- Theo, coffee.
- Yeah, sure, director.

495
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:34,282
- Where are you from?
- Brazil.

496
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,589
But my dad's English, so I can work here.

497
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:41,095
Yeah, but you speak Spanish, yeah?

498
01:01:43,166 --> 01:01:46,192
No, I don't. 
In Brazil, we speak Portuguese.

499
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:50,064
Good.

500
01:01:51,874 --> 01:01:54,240
What have you been working on recently?

501
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:57,574
Things. Some projects, you know.

502
01:01:58,915 --> 01:02:01,213
It's a bit of a hectic time right now.

503
01:02:03,019 --> 01:02:04,213
Things.

504
01:02:04,454 --> 01:02:06,445
Do you want to be a star?

505
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:10,292
I don't know.

506
01:02:11,594 --> 01:02:12,583
Yes.

507
01:02:17,867 --> 01:02:20,529
- Sorry. Coffee's off.
- Thanks.

508
01:02:23,072 --> 01:02:26,439
So here it is. A love triangle.

509
01:02:27,009 --> 01:02:30,570
There's a couple about to get married,
only the girl's having doubts.

510
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:33,877
You know, the usual shit.
Is she marrying the right guy, blah-blah?

511
01:02:33,950 --> 01:02:37,613
She does love her fiancé,
but there's something missing.

512
01:02:39,055 --> 01:02:42,991
And then on her hen night, she meets 
someone else.

513
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:47,520
Someone with a little fire in his belly.

514
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:51,660
And that's when things start to get 
interesting.

515
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:52,894
Great.

516
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:55,834
- Where's the script?
- No script.

517
01:02:57,106 --> 01:03:00,473
Improvisation. Reality cinema.

518
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:03,172
It's all the rage.

519
01:03:03,446 --> 01:03:05,971
- If you get the part...
- Of course.

520
01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:10,051
...then you'll use this
whenever you're with the girl...

521
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,784
to get your side of the story.

522
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:21,623
You in?

523
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:24,896
That's it?

524
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:28,695
- You don't want me to audition?
- She's gonna love you.

525
01:03:28,771 --> 01:03:31,501
I mean, this whole Latino thing...

526
01:03:31,741 --> 01:03:33,140
it's so now.

527
01:03:33,442 --> 01:03:34,773
Righteous.

528
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:37,074
Theo, contract and release form.

529
01:03:40,516 --> 01:03:42,006
Great. Yeah.

530
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:53,789
He hasn't even 
told you the sucker punch yet.

531
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:56,388
- Theo.
- The real twist of the movie.

532
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:58,298
What's that?

533
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:03,961
I was gonna tell you about that when 
we'd finalized the details.

534
01:04:07,009 --> 01:04:10,877
- No. What's he talking about?
- The girl, yeah, and her fiancé?

535
01:04:10,947 --> 01:04:13,575
They don't know they're in the movie.

536
01:04:14,116 --> 01:04:15,208
What?

537
01:04:17,153 --> 01:04:18,711
That's the hook.

538
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:22,980
They have no idea that they're there
for our entertainment.

539
01:04:24,260 --> 01:04:26,285
It's kind of an emotional snuff movie.

540
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:28,455
Put it on automatic, because it does 
it for you.

541
01:04:28,531 --> 01:04:31,762
That's videotaping, not filmmaking.
I'm a filmmaker, not a videotaper.

542
01:04:31,834 --> 01:04:35,065
You meet the girl on the hen night.
The real thing.

543
01:04:35,137 --> 01:04:37,401
Would you mind sharing a table?

544
01:04:37,573 --> 01:04:41,839
- No rehearsals?
- Life has no rehearsals.

545
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:43,242
And there's something else.

546
01:04:43,312 --> 01:04:46,475
I'd quite like to play a little joke
on my fiancée this evening.

547
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:48,642
Do you know that French tradition,
the one where...

548
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:53,178
The bride-to-be
must choose a man for one last kiss.

549
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:55,656
And remember, don't let any other 
handsome guys in.

550
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,249
I'm afraid we are fully booked, sir.

551
01:04:57,326 --> 01:04:59,351
- That should cover it.
- Yes.

552
01:05:01,430 --> 01:05:02,590
Thank you very much.

553
01:05:02,665 --> 01:05:04,155
She's a real beauty.

554
01:05:04,834 --> 01:05:07,598
Spanish. A little nuts.

555
01:05:07,803 --> 01:05:09,737
A kind of Betty Blue.

556
01:05:10,006 --> 01:05:12,167
Why do you have to film everything?

557
01:05:12,975 --> 01:05:16,741
I know where she lives, where she works.

558
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:19,042
- How did you find me?
- Your friends at the restaurant.

559
01:05:19,115 --> 01:05:20,707
They have a big mouth.

560
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,650
I even know what her favorite book is.

561
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:27,379
Seduction ammo.

562
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,817
So you want me to break up this 
relationship for real?

563
01:05:30,927 --> 01:05:32,019
Fucking A.

564
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:35,796
The guy is a real rich tosspot.

565
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:39,933
You break this couple up, you're gonna
be doing the girl a favor, trust me.

566
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:41,560
I live in the same building as him.

567
01:05:41,637 --> 01:05:43,468
I can get into his flat and hide the 
cameras.

568
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:45,507
They've got
this sound and motion function.

569
01:05:45,574 --> 01:05:46,768
Switch themselves on and off.

570
01:05:46,842 --> 01:05:49,675
And then, when he's out, I can just get 
in and change over the tapes.

571
01:05:49,745 --> 01:05:51,269
- Marry me.
- Barnaby.

572
01:05:51,347 --> 01:05:53,338
Life is fucking art, man.

573
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:56,314
I don't believe this.

574
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:59,918
The salary's £300 a week, cash.

575
01:06:05,661 --> 01:06:07,185
I can't do it.

576
01:06:09,265 --> 01:06:10,459
What?

577
01:06:11,033 --> 01:06:14,594
I mean, doesn't this seem wrong to you?

578
01:06:14,704 --> 01:06:16,365
I don't see where wrong comes into it.

579
01:06:16,439 --> 01:06:19,203
Either you want to be a star, or you don't.

580
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:22,142
You want to be famous,
you gotta fuck someone over.

581
01:06:24,213 --> 01:06:28,582
Look, I'm flattered, really, guys.
But, no, thanks.

582
01:06:32,455 --> 01:06:36,755
No dog experience, but I don't believe
that you need dog experience to...

583
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,350
Okay, thank you, bye.

584
01:06:38,894 --> 01:06:40,486
- Okay, £400.
- No.

585
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:42,595
Yeah, where I come from, in my culture...

586
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:44,895
it's very important
to do really good burgers.

587
01:06:44,967 --> 01:06:46,992
Dreams don't fall into your lap.

588
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:50,837
I know you're in there.

589
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:53,602
You'd better have it
by the time I get back, or you're out!

590
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,871
£500. Final offer.

591
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:01,646
Hi, it's Kit. Yeah, the Brazilian. 
Yeah, hi.

592
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:05,153
Is the offer still open?

593
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:21,759
Carmen, I'm sorry.

594
01:07:26,442 --> 01:07:27,534
I tried to stop it.

595
01:07:27,610 --> 01:07:29,100
I can't do this anymore, Ford.

596
01:07:29,178 --> 01:07:31,612
You pull out now, and I'll sue.
Read your contract.

597
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:33,011
Just be there.

598
01:07:33,516 --> 01:07:35,882
But you didn't stop it, Kit.

599
01:07:37,286 --> 01:07:39,015
You didn't stop it.

600
01:07:40,756 --> 01:07:44,283
- It was all an act.
- No, it wasn't. It wasn't an...

601
01:07:46,762 --> 01:07:48,229
Not with you.

602
01:07:49,198 --> 01:07:51,689
I was scared that if I told you...

603
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:10,812
Ford? How did you get into my flat?

604
01:08:11,887 --> 01:08:15,254
- Barnaby.
- Barnaby?

605
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:19,120
Dead man walking.

606
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,387
No fucking way.

607
01:08:22,765 --> 01:08:25,666
- You know, sometimes...
- No fucking way.

608
01:08:26,702 --> 01:08:28,397
...I amaze myself.

609
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:32,800
Nice.

610
01:08:37,413 --> 01:08:41,440
I saw them.
I saw the police and the ambulance.

611
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:43,016
I saw them.

612
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:48,178
Actors.

613
01:08:48,257 --> 01:08:49,918
All right. If she says anything to you...

614
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:53,052
- I'm so sorry.
...just tell her it's police procedure.

615
01:08:54,230 --> 01:08:55,788
I saw blood.

616
01:09:00,703 --> 01:09:01,931
Fuck me.

617
01:09:02,338 --> 01:09:05,171
- I want to see that back.
- That was magic.

618
01:09:06,175 --> 01:09:07,665
Go on, man.

619
01:09:09,211 --> 01:09:11,270
- Did it work?
- It did, yeah.

620
01:09:11,747 --> 01:09:13,078
I love you.

621
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:17,176
Fake, like Kit's feelings for you.

622
01:09:17,253 --> 01:09:20,245
- No, that's not true.
- What is it you call it?

623
01:09:20,656 --> 01:09:21,816
The Method.

624
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:24,285
- You motherfucker.
- What?

625
01:09:24,593 --> 01:09:27,858
No one forced you to do anything.
You wanted to be a star. Remember?

626
01:09:27,930 --> 01:09:29,898
- Yeah, well, you fucking married her.
- I know.

627
01:09:29,965 --> 01:09:31,523
Great twist, eh?

628
01:09:36,138 --> 01:09:37,332
Okay.

629
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,365
Just calm down.

630
01:09:43,812 --> 01:09:47,612
I have only come to pay what I owe.

631
01:09:48,884 --> 01:09:50,112
Fuck...

632
01:09:51,053 --> 01:09:53,521
You've grown a conscience all of 
a sudden?

633
01:09:53,956 --> 01:09:56,823
You didn't seem to mind fucking 
another man's wife.

634
01:10:02,531 --> 01:10:05,022
Suit yourself, but I need the camera back.

635
01:10:06,001 --> 01:10:08,162
Take it and get out.

636
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:12,969
- And the others.
- Others?

637
01:10:15,110 --> 01:10:17,044
Yeah, well, I can't let you keep it, kid.

638
01:10:17,112 --> 01:10:19,979
It's far too expensive.
You must understand that.

639
01:10:20,049 --> 01:10:21,573
Not in my fucking flat.

640
01:10:21,650 --> 01:10:23,379
It's a bedsit, Kit.

641
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:42,665
This is really good stuff.

642
01:10:42,738 --> 01:10:45,536
Carmen, I swear I know nothing
about this.

643
01:10:45,608 --> 01:10:48,133
No, there he is telling you the truth.

644
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:50,041
If I'd told him about the hidden cameras...

645
01:10:50,112 --> 01:10:52,103
his performance wouldn't have been
so authentic.

646
01:10:52,181 --> 01:10:53,808
And believe me...

647
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:57,848
that's about as authentic as it gets.

648
01:11:01,190 --> 01:11:03,283
- When we met...
- She speaks.

649
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:06,718
...did you have it planned already?

650
01:11:07,096 --> 01:11:09,223
Honey, try and keep up.

651
01:11:10,165 --> 01:11:12,463
It's why we met.

652
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:18,900
The moment I saw you,
I knew I'd found my character.

653
01:11:21,644 --> 01:11:24,511
Tempestuous, vulnerable...

654
01:11:25,214 --> 01:11:26,374
needy.

655
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:29,479
Why are you so good to me?

656
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:32,315
And then when I found out
about this psycho ex-boyfriend of hers...

657
01:11:32,388 --> 01:11:35,255
and the acid attack, perfect.

658
01:11:35,591 --> 01:11:38,526
It is brilliant casting on my part,
you must admit.

659
01:11:39,361 --> 01:11:41,955
I mean, the girl's a complete fuck-up.

660
01:11:46,235 --> 01:11:48,362
What? You want me to feel bad?

661
01:11:49,805 --> 01:11:50,931
I'm...

662
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:54,306
an artist.

663
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:57,738
Does a painter feel for his paint?

664
01:12:00,382 --> 01:12:03,545
You want a little sprinkling of 
Freudian motivation.

665
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:04,984
Might help.

666
01:12:06,355 --> 01:12:08,721
Let me see, what can I tell you?

667
01:12:09,591 --> 01:12:11,388
That I grew up alone?

668
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:15,956
That my parents threw money at me
instead of love?

669
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:18,261
That I was shunted
from one nanny to another...

670
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,859
from one heartless boarding school
to the next?

671
01:12:20,936 --> 01:12:23,461
That I was 
taught to be emotionally frigid?

672
01:12:25,240 --> 01:12:26,832
Well, fuck that.

673
01:12:27,843 --> 01:12:30,038
I did it because I was bored.

674
01:12:30,946 --> 01:12:32,504
Because I could.

675
01:12:32,581 --> 01:12:35,175
Because I had the time and the money.

676
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:39,014
I did it because people like me...

677
01:12:39,788 --> 01:12:43,724
get to play with the lives of people 
like you.

678
01:12:45,694 --> 01:12:49,130
Because you so desperately wanted
to believe in love.

679
01:13:05,247 --> 01:13:08,375
Just got out of hand, didn't it?

680
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:14,855
You went and kissed each other...

681
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:17,818
like you weren't meant to kiss each other.

682
01:13:24,466 --> 01:13:26,661
You never kissed me like that.

683
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:31,567
Not once.

684
01:13:40,015 --> 01:13:42,813
I suppose that that is why I...

685
01:13:54,663 --> 01:13:56,722
- Fuck me, I'm good.
- What the fuck?

686
01:13:56,799 --> 01:13:59,962
I just thought a little tearful confession
would come in useful, you know.

687
01:14:00,035 --> 01:14:03,163
Cut it into the film somewhere,
but that's the last one.

688
01:14:04,273 --> 01:14:05,535
Trust me.

689
01:14:10,245 --> 01:14:11,837
I just realized.

690
01:14:12,648 --> 01:14:13,740
What?

691
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:16,615
Nobody ever is gonna see your film.

692
01:14:17,219 --> 01:14:18,811
And why is that?

693
01:14:19,021 --> 01:14:21,854
Because you need a release form
from Carmen.

694
01:14:21,924 --> 01:14:23,892
You need her permission.

695
01:14:24,726 --> 01:14:28,253
Making a film is all about organization.

696
01:14:32,100 --> 01:14:34,227
You've got to think of everything.

697
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:38,103
Cross the "T's" and...

698
01:14:40,075 --> 01:14:41,337
dot the "I's."

699
01:14:49,318 --> 01:14:51,286
You'll thank me one day.

700
01:15:53,782 --> 01:15:56,342
How do you feel about being nominated
for the award...

701
01:15:56,418 --> 01:15:58,079
at the 3rd Indie-Vision Festival?

702
01:15:58,153 --> 01:16:00,383
I gotta tell you, it's a buzz.

703
01:16:01,189 --> 01:16:03,180
It's a great honor.

704
01:16:05,027 --> 01:16:08,554
More than I could've hoped for 
with this, my first film.

705
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:12,029
But I had a wonderful cast, a good 
team around me, so...

706
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:14,564
- Sorry.
- Sorry, what?

707
01:16:14,636 --> 01:16:17,469
Are we excited
about tonight's proceedings?

708
01:16:17,606 --> 01:16:19,403
Of course, we're very happy...

709
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:22,466
that "Dot the I" has been nominated
for an award tonight.

710
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:25,012
Everybody's invited.
There's no hard feelings between us.

711
01:16:25,080 --> 01:16:26,513
We're all great friends now.

712
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:29,415
I think everyone's very proud of our 
achievements.

713
01:16:30,018 --> 01:16:33,647
Especially as it was our idea in the 
first place.

714
01:16:33,755 --> 01:16:36,451
And the film has been doing so 
wonderfully well...

715
01:16:36,525 --> 01:16:38,425
on the film-festival circuit.

716
01:16:38,493 --> 01:16:42,327
Of course, we wanna get it out there,
you know, into the cinemas.

717
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:46,394
Well, this evening's proceedings should 
bring us a lot of publicity.

718
01:16:46,468 --> 01:16:49,631
Yes, well, we want a hit. 
Absolutely, yeah.

719
01:16:52,407 --> 01:16:54,671
Okay, good. One more like that.

720
01:16:57,713 --> 01:16:58,941
Sorry, what?

721
01:16:59,748 --> 01:17:01,045
When we were making the movie...

722
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:04,916
Carmen didn't know she was in the film,
and she was, understandably...

723
01:17:05,654 --> 01:17:07,679
a little freaked out at the time.

724
01:17:07,756 --> 01:17:09,451
And then time went by...

725
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:11,316
and I quietly went to work.

726
01:17:11,393 --> 01:17:14,453
And I cut together
a really moving performance.

727
01:17:14,896 --> 01:17:17,592
And I showed it to her. She loved it.

728
01:17:17,866 --> 01:17:21,097
Well, of course she loved it.
She's beautiful in it. She's wonderful.

729
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:24,570
It was like six or seven months of 
pent-up emotion...

730
01:17:24,640 --> 01:17:27,268
suddenly flowed out of her.

731
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:33,638
And I took her in my arms
after the screening, gave her a cuddle.

732
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:38,409
I think we made a connection that was
deeper than anything we had in the film.

733
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:41,422
Something very real now between 
Carmen and me.

734
01:17:41,590 --> 01:17:44,354
And so now 
we come to the Newcomer Award.

735
01:17:45,127 --> 01:17:47,095
And I'm pleased to say that in this 
category...

736
01:17:47,162 --> 01:17:51,121
the judging panel have come
to a completely unanimous decision.

737
01:17:52,034 --> 01:17:54,901
This award goes to a film which is...

738
01:17:55,070 --> 01:17:57,402
uncompromising and remarkable.

739
01:17:58,206 --> 01:18:00,606
It is an extraordinary achievement.

740
01:18:00,676 --> 01:18:05,136
A tragic love story which is startling
in its authenticity and realism.

741
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:07,209
- Put it on automatic.
- What?

742
01:18:07,282 --> 01:18:10,410
It gives me great pleasure
to present the Newcomer Award...

743
01:18:10,485 --> 01:18:13,283
to Barnaby F. Caspian for "Dot the I"!

744
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:15,152
- You're gonna miss him.
- I can handle it.

745
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:17,384
Put the fucking thing on automatic.

746
01:18:55,297 --> 01:18:57,959
Jesus Christ. Jesus fucking Christ.

747
01:18:58,033 --> 01:18:59,557
He's got a gun!

748
01:19:01,970 --> 01:19:03,870
- Is he dead?
- I don't know.

749
01:19:03,939 --> 01:19:06,066
- Did you get the shot?
- I think so.

750
01:19:06,842 --> 01:19:09,310
- Did you get the shot, Theo?
- I got it.

751
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:10,605
Good.

752
01:19:15,851 --> 01:19:17,148
Barnaby?

753
01:19:29,231 --> 01:19:31,995
- You wanna tell us what's going on?
- I wish I knew.

754
01:19:32,067 --> 01:19:35,059
You're gonna have to do better 
than that, son.

755
01:19:39,374 --> 01:19:41,569
It was Tom and Theo's idea...

756
01:19:42,711 --> 01:19:44,235
the whole film.

757
01:19:46,281 --> 01:19:50,877
And they thought it would be a great idea
if the film spilled over into real life.

758
01:19:52,087 --> 01:19:53,247
Go on.

759
01:19:55,190 --> 01:19:58,023
The plan was that I was...

760
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:04,489
supposed to be upset because Carmen 
was back with Barnaby.

761
01:20:05,167 --> 01:20:08,227
I would seek my revenge in his 
moment of glory.

762
01:20:08,603 --> 01:20:11,128
I was going to pretend to shoot him.

763
01:20:11,673 --> 01:20:15,939
And he was going to pretend to go down.
Just for the cameras, you know?

764
01:20:16,845 --> 01:20:21,612
Then I would get jumped on, and we'd
let it go on just for a little while...

765
01:20:21,850 --> 01:20:24,751
until the whole ceremony descended 
into chaos.

766
01:20:24,820 --> 01:20:28,847
Then he would get up, and that was it.
We'd all have a good laugh.

767
01:20:29,224 --> 01:20:30,953
What was the point?

768
01:20:31,693 --> 01:20:33,923
What was the point? Publicity.

769
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:39,490
The stunt would hit the news,
and you can't buy that kind of publicity.

770
01:20:40,435 --> 01:20:44,428
Tom and Theo thought that the film
would be a hit off the back of it.

771
01:20:48,143 --> 01:20:51,203
- This is a starter pistol.
- I know.

772
01:20:51,580 --> 01:20:54,378
- It only fires blanks.
- I know.

773
01:20:55,784 --> 01:21:00,244
Then if you shot him with a starter pistol,
perhaps you could explain to me...

774
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:03,814
how Barnaby is lying in a hospital bed
fighting for his life.

775
01:21:04,292 --> 01:21:06,556
All I know is that that was the plan.

776
01:21:07,629 --> 01:21:10,120
That's why I was given the starter pistol.

777
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:13,497
- You can't go in there, love. Sorry.
- No, he's my husband.

778
01:21:13,568 --> 01:21:17,698
You know, maybe you should talk to 
Tom and Theo. It was their idea.

779
01:21:18,607 --> 01:21:21,804
And, you know,
they were always a little bit nuts.

780
01:21:23,078 --> 01:21:25,876
I don't know,
maybe they took the stunt to heart.

781
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:37,518
I don't know what you're talking about.

782
01:21:37,592 --> 01:21:40,288
I don't know anything about no 
publicity stunt.

783
01:21:55,543 --> 01:21:57,340
Is this camera yours?

784
01:22:02,617 --> 01:22:03,675
Yes.

785
01:22:05,153 --> 01:22:06,415
And this?

786
01:22:14,062 --> 01:22:16,895
- This has nothing to do with us.
- They found it in the ballroom.

787
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:19,160
- Another starting pistol?
- No.

788
01:22:19,567 --> 01:22:21,364
It's an automatic. Guess what?

789
01:22:21,436 --> 01:22:24,064
- It's recently been fired.
- So?

790
01:22:24,506 --> 01:22:26,667
I've never seen that fucking thing
in my life.

791
01:22:26,741 --> 01:22:30,142
Then perhaps you could explain why
it has your fingerprints all over it.

792
01:22:30,211 --> 01:22:32,042
- What?
- No, I swear.

793
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:33,273
I swear.

794
01:22:34,449 --> 01:22:36,644
Let's have a look at this, shall we?

795
01:22:39,888 --> 01:22:44,086
And tonight's proceedings
should bring us a lot of publicity.

796
01:22:44,826 --> 01:22:46,657
Because, you know, we want a hit.

797
01:22:46,728 --> 01:22:47,752
Absolutely.

798
01:22:47,829 --> 01:22:48,887
Sir.

799
01:22:55,937 --> 01:22:59,031
Well, boys,
you're in a whole heap of trouble.

800
01:23:00,308 --> 01:23:01,775
Barnaby's dead.

801
01:23:06,715 --> 01:23:08,683
So what have we got?

802
01:23:10,652 --> 01:23:12,620
To present the Newcomer Award...

803
01:23:12,687 --> 01:23:15,349
Put it on automatic.
You're gonna miss the shot.

804
01:23:15,423 --> 01:23:17,254
- You're gonna miss him.
- I can handle it.

805
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:19,486
Put the fucking thing on automatic.

806
01:23:56,898 --> 01:23:59,924
Jesus Christ. Jesus fucking Christ.

807
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:01,332
He's got a gun.

808
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:05,131
- Is he dead?
- I don't know.

809
01:24:05,206 --> 01:24:07,197
Oh, Jesus Christ.
Did you get the shot, Theo?

810
01:24:07,275 --> 01:24:09,266
- I think so.
- Did you get it?

811
01:24:09,611 --> 01:24:11,602
- I got it.
- Good.

812
01:24:41,843 --> 01:24:43,811
Theo, what the fuck have you done?

813
01:24:43,878 --> 01:24:47,473
I swear I found it in my pocket.
Honest, I don't know where it came from.

814
01:24:47,549 --> 01:24:50,143
What the fuck have you done?

815
01:24:50,218 --> 01:24:53,016
I think you should get yourselves a lawyer.

816
01:26:53,541 --> 01:26:56,237
Have you been following the 
Tom and Theo trial?

817
01:26:56,978 --> 01:26:58,468
Do you miss Barnaby?

818
01:26:58,846 --> 01:27:01,007
Carmen, who made your dress?

819
01:27:03,785 --> 01:27:05,047
Get that camera out of here!

820
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:34,324
Dot the I passes the $50 million mark.

821
01:29:34,402 --> 01:29:35,892
It's a lot of money.

822
01:29:38,740 --> 01:29:40,207
What are you doing?

823
01:29:43,678 --> 01:29:45,509
You got any papers in there?
