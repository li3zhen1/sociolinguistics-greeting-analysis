1
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:52,613
It's falling. It's falling!

2
00:01:52,863 --> 00:01:56,534
A little bird is falling from the sky.

3
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:58,452
Pick it up quickly.

4
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:05,501
What's the matter?

5
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,461
How could I know?

6
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:20,558
Get the kids out of the car quickly.

7
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:27,231
Hurry up. Out of the car.

8
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:34,530
Help!

9
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:49,397
Professor Liu, any developments on the...

10
00:03:49,647 --> 00:03:50,773
disaster that happened some days before?

11
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:54,485
Professor, any comment on the disaster?

12
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:59,031
It's heard that monsters are invading...

13
00:03:59,323 --> 00:04:00,533
the earth. Is it possible?

14
00:04:02,034 --> 00:04:04,620
Excuse me.

15
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:18,217
Enter the data in the computer.

16
00:04:18,843 --> 00:04:20,469
Zhu Qiguang, the waveform seems warped.

17
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:26,600
Locate the reason and report.

18
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:29,270
Zhu, come and take a look.

19
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,313
Problem in the communication system

20
00:04:32,565 --> 00:04:34,734
Look! These two are also out of order.

21
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:40,698
Chen, record and report it to the master.

22
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:42,742
The master is here.

23
00:04:44,952 --> 00:04:45,786
Reporting

24
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:48,372
A strong wave hit the control center.

25
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:51,167
Communication system is out of order.

26
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:16,233
Chen, call the engineers and

27
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:17,943
Fix the No. 3 transmission center now.

28
00:05:18,194 --> 00:05:18,986
Yes.

29
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,447
Hold it. Start the ultra-wave system.

30
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:22,823
Zhu Qiguang

31
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,950
Give me the city disaster report.

32
00:05:25,201 --> 00:05:26,160
Yes.

33
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:49,725
Professor

34
00:05:51,811 --> 00:05:52,603
Zhu Qiguang

35
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,897
The strong wave came from outer space.

36
00:05:55,105 --> 00:05:56,148
Keep track of it.

37
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,192
Professor, here's the city disaster report.

38
00:05:58,484 --> 00:06:00,486
10 miles away from here, there's an earthquake...

39
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:02,279
of magnitude 12 at the Mount Devil

40
00:06:08,244 --> 00:06:11,747
This volcano has been dormant for 2000 years.

41
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:13,290
How could it erupt all of a sudden!

42
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:15,668
Could it be...

43
00:06:18,796 --> 00:06:19,255
Professor

44
00:06:19,463 --> 00:06:21,715
Earthquake

45
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:42,403
Zhu Min

46
00:06:43,529 --> 00:06:44,321
Professor

47
00:06:44,864 --> 00:06:46,782
Stay calm. Keep working.

48
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:47,783
Professor

49
00:06:47,992 --> 00:06:50,953
Min, call the Earthquake Center and...

50
00:06:51,161 --> 00:06:52,079
find out the reason of earthquake.

51
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:53,205
Yes.

52
00:06:55,875 --> 00:06:56,750
Qiguang,

53
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:59,003
start computerized tracking on the mount

54
00:06:59,628 --> 00:07:00,504
Yes

55
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:04,049
Satellite Communication Section

56
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:05,175
Get ready

57
00:07:05,718 --> 00:07:08,721
North latitude 205.6! East longitude 131.8

58
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:16,312
Professor, tracking system is ready.

59
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:20,357
We've the Mount Devil locked on scanner

60
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:21,609
Report.

61
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:24,153
We've started the tracking on the mount.

62
00:07:28,616 --> 00:07:32,786
10, 9, 8, 7, 6

63
00:07:33,037 --> 00:07:38,417
<i>51413121110</i>

64
00:07:57,394 --> 00:07:58,228
What's this?

65
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,563
Professor!

66
00:08:10,699 --> 00:08:12,701
Professor, we are interfered

67
00:08:27,675 --> 00:08:30,970
Listen, human beings. I'm Princess Elzibub.

68
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,389
I've conquered the earth.

69
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:36,934
I'm your new master now.

70
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:40,270
The disaster was just a small example...

71
00:08:40,604 --> 00:08:42,982
of my great strength.

72
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:46,110
You just have to surrender to me

73
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,446
or I'll destroy the human race.

74
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:50,739
No one can be spared.

75
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:58,038
Zhu Qiguang

76
00:08:58,288 --> 00:09:00,290
Keep on tracking the Mount Devil,

77
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:03,293
analyze the data...

78
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:04,712
and find out where the Devil comes from.

79
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:05,879
Yes.

80
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:10,217
Where are Rayma and Xiao Lung?

81
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:27,276
Rayma, it's for you.

82
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:29,945
I'll be right back.

83
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:31,196
I'm going to headquarters now.

84
00:09:31,447 --> 00:09:32,698
Linlin, you bring Xiao Hu back home.

85
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:38,787
Xiao Lung, hurry up.

86
00:09:44,752 --> 00:09:47,796
We've been receiving calls...

87
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:50,174
from all over the world.

88
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,468
Almost all at the same time,

89
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,764
Refineries, bus terminals, factories and

90
00:09:57,014 --> 00:10:00,225
and schools were hit by electric wave.

91
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:01,935
There're serious damages.

92
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,483
It's possible that human beings on earth

93
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:11,111
are facing the most severe invasion

94
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:13,781
as the Princess Elzibub stated.

95
00:10:16,658 --> 00:10:19,036
What's the Princess Elzibub?

96
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,747
Professor Liu will explain to you.

97
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,588
It's a creature of higher level.

98
00:10:30,506 --> 00:10:33,675
It's possible that it's the human being...

99
00:10:33,926 --> 00:10:35,928
of the Ice Age on earth.

100
00:10:36,637 --> 00:10:37,888
20 million years ago,

101
00:10:38,097 --> 00:10:40,849
After the glacial disaster, they're

102
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,102
buried in earth's innermost regions.

103
00:10:43,352 --> 00:10:45,896
But they're still alive.

104
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:47,064
On the contrary,

105
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:50,818
they adapted to the environment.

106
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,987
Now they feel that they've no need

107
00:10:54,238 --> 00:10:55,906
to be buried under the earth.

108
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:57,991
So I suggest we should

109
00:10:58,242 --> 00:11:00,786
execute the "BDX Plan" now.

110
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,997
Professor Liu, you'll be in charge of it.

111
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,500
You must succeed.

112
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,804
Specter Skeleton and Ice Monster, come out

113
00:11:46,999 --> 00:11:47,833
Listen.

114
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,794
We're back on earth.

115
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,175
Show your power

116
00:11:56,466 --> 00:12:00,220
and destroy the human beings

117
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:03,140
To eliminate the invasion of Princess Elzibub

118
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,683
and to protect our cities,

119
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:06,727
I announce that from now on,

120
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:09,730
the research center is in emergency mode.

121
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:10,814
Right

122
00:12:15,819 --> 00:12:18,530
Qiguang, you're taking my post now.

123
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,615
Yes.

124
00:12:23,035 --> 00:12:23,744
Lung, Min...

125
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:24,786
Yes

126
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:27,873
Enforce the protection.

127
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:28,957
Yes.

128
00:12:32,211 --> 00:12:33,629
Rayma, come with me.

129
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:35,005
Okay

130
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:24,304
Rayma, this is my work of research

131
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,014
for many years.

132
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:26,807
The Inframan

133
00:13:27,057 --> 00:13:27,724
I see

134
00:13:27,975 --> 00:13:30,686
To cope with the invasion,

135
00:13:30,936 --> 00:13:32,020
there must be someone who possesses

136
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:33,689
unusual power and ability.

137
00:13:34,064 --> 00:13:36,817
Most sophisticated devices are planted

138
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:38,860
...in his body.

139
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:40,445
Then special kind...

140
00:13:43,031 --> 00:13:46,034
of biological hormone is injected.

141
00:13:46,493 --> 00:13:49,663
With the electric wave,

142
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:52,124
he'll produce

143
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:56,795
a mighty power which are...

144
00:13:57,087 --> 00:13:59,506
water, fire and thunder resistant.

145
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:02,384
It's strong enough to resist the devil.

146
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,886
Professor, I got it.

147
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:06,471
Please transform me into an Inframan

148
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:10,600
Rayma, you'll suffer severe pain.

149
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:12,978
Maybe your life will be in danger as well.

150
00:14:13,979 --> 00:14:18,025
Have you really made up your mind?

151
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:19,568
In order to protect the mankind...

152
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:22,279
I'm willing to do this.

153
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:50,223
How's it?

154
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:53,268
Don't worry. I'm okay.

155
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:54,895
Please proceed.

156
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:34,119
Witch Eye

157
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:37,414
My Princess, what can I do for you?

158
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:39,040
Start the transport control system

159
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,251
I want to see the Ice Monster.

160
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,335
Yes.

161
00:16:53,096 --> 00:16:56,475
My Princess, let me kill all the people on earth

162
00:16:56,725 --> 00:16:57,809
Do you now...

163
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,394
there's a powerful enemy now?

164
00:16:59,644 --> 00:17:00,687
It's a great threat to us.

165
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:03,523
Tell me

166
00:17:03,773 --> 00:17:06,026
who stops us from ruling the world.

167
00:17:06,234 --> 00:17:08,653
Send me out to destroy this enemy.

168
00:17:09,404 --> 00:17:10,864
Get the Mutant Drill,

169
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:12,532
Monster Plant out.

170
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:13,909
Yes.

171
00:17:25,795 --> 00:17:27,631
My Princess,

172
00:17:39,684 --> 00:17:42,479
please send us out

173
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,648
show our power to them.

174
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:46,691
Look.

175
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,819
This is the largest research center.

176
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:55,367
He's the Department head Liu Yingde.

177
00:17:55,659 --> 00:17:57,410
When we're back to the earth,

178
00:17:57,744 --> 00:17:59,579
we can't hide from them.

179
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:03,583
It's the prime obstacle in ruling the earth

180
00:18:04,167 --> 00:18:06,169
So the most important job is...

181
00:18:06,419 --> 00:18:08,505
to eliminate them completely.

182
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:13,885
I order you to invade in separate courses

183
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:15,637
Go immediately

184
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:21,865
Qiguang, Qiguang-

185
00:21:22,157 --> 00:21:22,991
The devil has surrounded...

186
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:26,369
the research building.

187
00:21:26,661 --> 00:21:28,663
What did you say?

188
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:52,771
Quick, get a grasp

189
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,345
Get the weapon and shoot them.

190
00:24:47,528 --> 00:24:48,905
Qiguang, what's the problem?

191
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:52,408
Professor, the centre is attacked by devils.

192
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:53,701
The power supply is damaged.

193
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:56,454
You must restore the power in 1 minute

194
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:58,164
or Rayma will die.

195
00:24:58,414 --> 00:24:59,540
Got it

196
00:26:37,305 --> 00:26:39,766
Rayma...

197
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:44,228
Professor

198
00:26:57,617 --> 00:26:59,827
Do you feel any change in your body?

199
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,496
I feel that I'm full of power.

200
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:21,599
I feel like being invincible.

201
00:27:21,849 --> 00:27:24,018
I can see and hear things far far away

202
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:27,355
I hear a strange sound

203
00:27:28,773 --> 00:27:30,900
You've the power of an Inframan now.

204
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,694
The devil is attacking the center...

205
00:27:41,285 --> 00:27:42,411
and Lung now.

206
00:27:48,334 --> 00:27:49,043
Rayma

207
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:51,963
I order you to rescue Lung.

208
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:53,005
Yes.

209
00:27:59,554 --> 00:28:00,346
Look.

210
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:03,307
Who's he?

211
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:04,642
Inframan

212
00:28:04,892 --> 00:28:05,893
It's Inframan!

213
00:28:42,513 --> 00:28:43,306
Fire bomb

214
00:30:06,889 --> 00:30:07,682
Fire bomb

215
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:52,893
Who are you?

216
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:56,397
What do you want?

217
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:58,691
Princess, let me kill him

218
00:30:58,941 --> 00:31:00,443
to take revenge for Plant.

219
00:31:03,571 --> 00:31:06,615
Hold it. He's my first hostage

220
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:08,367
I don't want him dead.

221
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:11,662
Zhu Min, listen to my order

222
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:15,124
or you're a dead man.

223
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:21,464
I...I

224
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:25,176
Witch Eye, take him for brain draining.

225
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:27,094
Yes.

226
00:32:18,187 --> 00:32:20,856
Eye, put Min's memory nerves

227
00:32:21,107 --> 00:32:23,776
and other nerves together.

228
00:32:45,506 --> 00:32:48,509
Zhu Min, pledge your loyalty to the Princess.

229
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:52,805
Princess, I'll be your servant forever.

230
00:33:07,319 --> 00:33:10,739
Professor, I'm going to Mount Devil

231
00:33:11,157 --> 00:33:13,492
to rescue Min and then...

232
00:33:13,784 --> 00:33:17,121
No, the enemy is very powerful.

233
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:20,082
You're no match for them.

234
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:26,755
Wait till I produce the Thunder Fist.

235
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:30,217
You'll have the power to destroy them.

236
00:33:31,302 --> 00:33:32,344
Thunder Fist?

237
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,847
Yes, Thunder Fist.

238
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:40,936
What's the matter?

239
00:33:41,187 --> 00:33:42,480
Professor, Zhu Min is back.

240
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:43,647
Ask him to come here.

241
00:33:46,108 --> 00:33:47,067
Zhu Min is back.

242
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:53,157
How are you? We're looking for you.

243
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:57,161
Say something.

244
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:01,040
What's the problem?

245
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:04,043
Zhu Min, what's wrong with you?

246
00:34:04,627 --> 00:34:06,754
Nothing.

247
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:14,011
My car had problems.

248
00:34:16,764 --> 00:34:24,438
I was lost and found my way out.

249
00:34:24,688 --> 00:34:27,858
I thought you've been grabbed by devils.

250
00:34:28,275 --> 00:34:31,612
Devils? No...no...

251
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:38,994
Zhu Min, where the hell have you been?

252
00:34:39,662 --> 00:34:40,037
No.

253
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:42,998
Rayma, maybe he's shocked.

254
00:34:43,249 --> 00:34:44,667
Let him take a rest.

255
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:58,097
Professor, something's wrong with Zhu Min.

256
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:03,394
Xiao Lung, look after him carefully.

257
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:04,603
Yes.

258
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:13,445
Zhu Min, go now.

259
00:35:13,654 --> 00:35:15,698
Get me the design plan of Inframan

260
00:35:20,077 --> 00:35:22,121
Zhu Min, what are you doing?

261
00:37:42,636 --> 00:37:43,512
Zhu Min.

262
00:37:53,021 --> 00:37:53,856
What?

263
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:56,984
Zhu Min.

264
00:38:01,572 --> 00:38:02,698
Zhu Min, what are you doing?

265
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:47,636
You two guard Min back for the Princess.

266
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:50,347
I'll take care of this kid.

267
00:39:50,556 --> 00:39:51,431
Yes.

268
00:41:47,714 --> 00:41:49,299
Change to Inframan

269
00:42:08,777 --> 00:42:09,736
Sun Ja

270
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:16,118
Lung.

271
00:43:19,306 --> 00:43:20,515
Sun Ja.

272
00:43:57,886 --> 00:43:58,929
Sun Ja

273
00:44:03,642 --> 00:44:04,893
Sun Ja

274
00:44:35,674 --> 00:44:41,304
The Giant.

275
00:46:30,747 --> 00:46:32,707
What a Chinese Inframan!

276
00:46:33,083 --> 00:46:35,335
You killed 3 of my devils.

277
00:46:36,544 --> 00:46:37,295
Mutant Drill,

278
00:46:37,963 --> 00:46:39,798
You and Min go to bomb the centre

279
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:48,014
Witch Eye,

280
00:46:48,431 --> 00:46:50,100
project the design plan

281
00:46:50,350 --> 00:46:51,434
on the screen.

282
00:46:52,686 --> 00:46:56,189
I want to know how good Inframan is.

283
00:46:56,731 --> 00:46:57,941
Princess, it's ready.

284
00:47:05,115 --> 00:47:07,409
Freeze. Enlarge the hand.

285
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:17,502
So this is the Sun Ja.

286
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:24,342
Come on. It's fun there.

287
00:47:29,931 --> 00:47:32,684
Xiao Hu, come back. We need a break.

288
00:47:32,892 --> 00:47:35,061
Sister Mei, Rayma became the Inframan.

289
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:37,689
Will the devil show up again?

290
00:47:38,148 --> 00:47:38,940
I don't know.

291
00:47:39,149 --> 00:47:41,526
But Rayma reminds us to be very careful.

292
00:47:41,776 --> 00:47:42,444
Don't be reckless.

293
00:47:42,694 --> 00:47:44,487
Sister Mei, is there any Infrawoman?

294
00:47:44,738 --> 00:47:47,115
I wish to be an Inframan

295
00:47:47,365 --> 00:47:50,493
But there're requirements.

296
00:47:50,744 --> 00:47:51,870
What're the requirements?

297
00:47:53,747 --> 00:47:57,500
First, good health. Secondly, courage

298
00:47:57,792 --> 00:48:00,503
Thirdly, self-sacrifice.

299
00:48:00,795 --> 00:48:03,173
Mei, am I qualified?

300
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:07,052
You chicken.

301
00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:08,762
You laugh at me!

302
00:48:09,054 --> 00:48:10,430
Don't go.

303
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:11,723
Chicken, come on.

304
00:48:12,307 --> 00:48:13,224
Don't run.

305
00:48:13,975 --> 00:48:15,727
Chicken, come on.

306
00:48:16,019 --> 00:48:17,020
Don't run.

307
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:20,190
Don't run.

308
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:22,567
Chicken, come on.

309
00:48:24,069 --> 00:48:25,403
You bully me. I'll beat you.

310
00:48:25,653 --> 00:48:28,656
Stop. We always come here.

311
00:48:28,907 --> 00:48:30,033
Why haven't we ever spotted a hole here?

312
00:48:32,494 --> 00:48:34,537
I think the devil must be inside.

313
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:36,581
You say there're devils inside.

314
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:39,292
You're bold. Go and take a look

315
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:41,461
Okay. Nothing to fear.

316
00:49:00,897 --> 00:49:01,356
Where's Xiao Hu?

317
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:03,024
He's inside.

318
00:49:04,067 --> 00:49:05,902
Xiao Hu, don't go inside.

319
00:49:14,202 --> 00:49:15,620
Zhu Min, come in.

320
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:19,958
The compression room is here.

321
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,835
Zhu Min, place the dynamite there.

322
00:49:22,085 --> 00:49:23,461
The building will explode into pieces.

323
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:06,463
Xiao Hu...Xiao Hu...

324
00:50:08,089 --> 00:50:09,215
Why doesn't he come out?

325
00:50:09,757 --> 00:50:11,801
Linlin, wait here. I'm going inside.

326
00:50:12,093 --> 00:50:13,720
No, I'm going too.

327
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:16,306
Oh, come on! I won't be long

328
00:50:23,646 --> 00:50:26,107
Okay. What the hell!

329
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:36,868
Xiao Hu

330
00:50:43,374 --> 00:50:44,417
Xiao Hu

331
00:50:53,927 --> 00:50:54,928
Xiao Hu

332
00:50:56,971 --> 00:50:58,348
Xiao Hu, what are you doing?

333
00:51:08,316 --> 00:51:13,321
Tie her up. I want both of you buried &

334
00:51:13,988 --> 00:51:17,992
blown into pieces with this building.

335
00:51:18,868 --> 00:51:21,079
Zhu Min, pull the lead outside.

336
00:51:21,371 --> 00:51:22,163
Yes.

337
00:51:42,934 --> 00:51:43,685
Linlin

338
00:51:48,398 --> 00:51:49,190
Who are you mad at?

339
00:51:49,482 --> 00:51:51,609
Xiao Hu. He's not playing with me.

340
00:51:52,068 --> 00:51:52,735
I see.

341
00:51:53,027 --> 00:51:54,821
I'll play with you. Let me do a flip; watch

342
00:51:56,656 --> 00:51:59,409
No. I want to go inside the cave.

343
00:52:00,076 --> 00:52:00,868
Cave?

344
00:52:02,704 --> 00:52:03,204
Where?

345
00:52:03,454 --> 00:52:05,540
There. Xiao Hu found it out.

346
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:09,794
Mei too has gone inside. I'm not allowed.

347
00:52:10,545 --> 00:52:12,255
Stay here. Don't go anywhere.

348
00:52:19,012 --> 00:52:21,723
Come on, let's go outside.

349
00:52:50,126 --> 00:52:51,085
Mei...Xiao Hu...

350
00:52:56,466 --> 00:52:58,217
The Inframan

351
00:53:13,566 --> 00:53:16,027
It's the Inframan again!

352
00:53:16,402 --> 00:53:18,237
Mutant Drill, don't move.

353
00:53:19,113 --> 00:53:21,449
First grab Liu Yingde to pay for the debt.

354
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:22,450
Yes.

355
00:53:27,747 --> 00:53:28,414
Rayma...

356
00:53:31,209 --> 00:53:32,460
transmit the thunder power.

357
00:53:32,877 --> 00:53:33,670
Yes.

358
00:53:34,462 --> 00:53:36,422
Boost the voltage up to 7300 degrees

359
00:53:45,682 --> 00:53:47,141
Start the light speed laser

360
00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:48,601
Right

361
00:53:58,945 --> 00:54:01,239
Professor, power has reached

362
00:54:01,489 --> 00:54:02,949
10,000 billion watts per centimeter

363
00:54:09,038 --> 00:54:10,248
Turn down the laser.

364
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:12,166
Yes.

365
00:54:17,046 --> 00:54:18,548
Rayma, look.

366
00:54:24,637 --> 00:54:25,388
Put it on.

367
00:54:26,347 --> 00:54:28,725
This Thunder Fist can produce laser

368
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:32,395
which has 10,000 watts per centimeter.

369
00:54:32,687 --> 00:54:37,066
They'll destroy everything in range

370
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,778
It's the carbon matter of highest density

371
00:54:41,112 --> 00:54:42,655
It's known as Jingang Stone.

372
00:54:43,239 --> 00:54:44,949
Scientific tests show that

373
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:47,660
it's the most hardest matter on earth.

374
00:54:53,583 --> 00:54:56,586
Rayma, see if you can break it up.

375
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:02,341
Thunder Fist

376
00:55:06,929 --> 00:55:08,473
Professor, we did it!

377
00:55:11,142 --> 00:55:13,102
Inside the glove, there's

378
00:55:13,311 --> 00:55:14,937
a Laser Blade from the fist...

379
00:55:15,396 --> 00:55:18,065
which can cut the monster's limbs to pieces

380
00:55:21,027 --> 00:55:23,279
You're powerful enough...

381
00:55:23,488 --> 00:55:25,323
to eliminate any monster.

382
00:55:25,782 --> 00:55:27,617
Rayma, go and make preparations...

383
00:55:27,909 --> 00:55:28,951
take some rest for tomorrow's attack

384
00:55:29,202 --> 00:55:30,119
Yes.

385
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:13,412
Dad.

386
00:56:15,081 --> 00:56:17,041
Mei, why are you here?

387
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:34,642
Dad, you haven't slept for 2 days.

388
00:56:34,892 --> 00:56:36,602
Your eye has turned red

389
00:56:41,399 --> 00:56:43,568
I'm not tired.

390
00:56:44,735 --> 00:56:47,071
As long as I see you living peacefully

391
00:56:48,823 --> 00:56:51,242
I won't feel tired.

392
00:56:55,162 --> 00:56:58,583
You shouldn't always lock yourself here.

393
00:57:00,501 --> 00:57:01,836
Mei, you should know

394
00:57:02,545 --> 00:57:05,506
the monster is invading our world,

395
00:57:06,173 --> 00:57:11,304
destroying out cities and killing people.

396
00:57:13,723 --> 00:57:15,433
In this critical time,

397
00:57:17,435 --> 00:57:19,270
it's almost impossible for me to...

398
00:57:20,479 --> 00:57:21,898
rest peacefully and be comfortable.

399
00:57:22,356 --> 00:57:24,567
Dad, I...

400
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:33,868
Come on, kid.

401
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:37,496
Do you know in your dad's life,

402
00:57:37,747 --> 00:57:41,125
what has been the most happiest moment?

403
00:57:41,918 --> 00:57:44,921
I don't know. Tell me.

404
00:57:45,212 --> 00:57:48,007
You sit down. I'll tell you.

405
00:57:52,637 --> 00:57:58,476
The day a little life came to this world.

406
00:57:59,185 --> 00:58:03,522
Her face so red and crying out loudly

407
00:58:04,482 --> 00:58:08,235
Her skin shriveled all over

408
00:58:08,569 --> 00:58:10,154
But when I saw it,

409
00:58:10,363 --> 00:58:11,864
I just felt very happy.

410
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:15,076
Dad, you've described me as an ugly girl.

411
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:18,454
No matter how ugly, you're my daughter.

412
00:58:20,122 --> 00:58:23,167
Stay here. I need to attend to something

413
00:58:23,417 --> 00:58:26,212
I'll be back and we'll have dinner together.

414
00:58:26,462 --> 00:58:29,131
Then I'll have a good rest. Okay?

415
00:58:29,757 --> 00:58:30,591
All right

416
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:35,680
Stay for a while.

417
01:00:11,692 --> 01:00:12,359
Dad.

418
01:00:12,568 --> 01:00:15,071
We're late again. The old guy has gone.

419
01:00:15,321 --> 01:00:15,821
Daddy

420
01:00:16,113 --> 01:00:16,989
Please take her away

421
01:00:26,707 --> 01:00:30,878
We'll land her and attack Mount Devil.

422
01:00:31,796 --> 01:00:33,923
We must eliminate the monster

423
01:00:35,758 --> 01:00:38,469
Rayma, you've a heavy burden.

424
01:00:38,719 --> 01:00:40,679
Professor, I'll finish my mission.

425
01:00:42,431 --> 01:00:43,933
Have a good rest

426
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:45,684
for tomorrow's mission.

427
01:00:45,935 --> 01:00:46,852
Yes.

428
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:03,828
Mei...Mei...

429
01:01:04,078 --> 01:01:04,954
Liu Yingde.

430
01:01:07,123 --> 01:01:10,292
Your daughter is in my possession now.

431
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,628
Don't harm my daughter.

432
01:01:12,962 --> 01:01:14,880
Professor Liu, lose your temper?

433
01:01:15,172 --> 01:01:17,049
She's so nice and comfy here!

434
01:01:18,634 --> 01:01:19,844
You...

435
01:01:20,177 --> 01:01:21,971
If you wish her to be safe and sound...

436
01:01:22,263 --> 01:01:24,807
come to see me before noon tomorrow

437
01:01:25,224 --> 01:01:27,059
Oh, and yes... remember to come alone

438
01:01:35,442 --> 01:01:36,944
Professor, what should we do?

439
01:01:39,446 --> 01:01:40,447
I've to go this time.

440
01:01:40,698 --> 01:01:41,657
I'm going with you.

441
01:01:41,907 --> 01:01:42,867
It's too dangerous.

442
01:01:43,117 --> 01:01:44,910
Right. Let Rayma go with you.

443
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:50,082
No. They stressed I had to be alone

444
01:01:52,001 --> 01:01:56,213
Rayma, if anything happens,

445
01:01:57,256 --> 01:01:59,091
attack as planned.

446
01:03:55,082 --> 01:03:56,792
Welcome, Professor Liu.

447
01:03:59,837 --> 01:04:04,508
Where's my daughter? Where's she?

448
01:04:05,092 --> 01:04:06,343
Your daughter's well-being

449
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:10,097
depends on how well you work with us.

450
01:04:10,556 --> 01:04:12,391
I need to see her.

451
01:04:12,808 --> 01:04:16,687
Okay. Witch Eye, bring her here.

452
01:04:16,937 --> 01:04:17,730
Yes.

453
01:04:28,741 --> 01:04:29,199
Mei!

454
01:04:29,491 --> 01:04:30,284
Dad.

455
01:04:32,661 --> 01:04:33,412
Don't be scared.

456
01:04:35,122 --> 01:04:38,500
I know you love your kid very much.

457
01:04:38,834 --> 01:04:41,587
Of course, you'll sacrifice anything for her.

458
01:04:41,879 --> 01:04:42,796
What do you mean?

459
01:04:43,130 --> 01:04:46,050
It's simple.

460
01:04:47,134 --> 01:04:47,801
Zhu Min.

461
01:04:49,511 --> 01:04:50,262
My Princess.

462
01:05:07,988 --> 01:05:08,822
Did you see?

463
01:05:10,824 --> 01:05:16,497
Zhu Min has turned into ashes.

464
01:05:19,041 --> 01:05:22,211
If you want her alive,

465
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:25,589
you must obey me

466
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:27,257
and work for me forever.

467
01:05:27,549 --> 01:05:29,343
No, dad

468
01:05:30,886 --> 01:05:34,306
Professor Liu, it's about her life.

469
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:35,724
You've to think carefully.

470
01:05:37,017 --> 01:05:40,104
Princess Elzibub, you listen carefully too.

471
01:05:40,396 --> 01:05:42,398
Stop thinking that I'll work for you

472
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:45,150
or that you'll get to rule the world.

473
01:05:46,485 --> 01:05:49,238
It belongs to the peaceful human beings.

474
01:05:51,156 --> 01:05:53,450
No matter what you do to my daughter,

475
01:05:54,118 --> 01:05:56,578
the Chinese Inframan won't spare you.

476
01:05:56,787 --> 01:05:57,830
The Chinese Inframan?

477
01:06:00,833 --> 01:06:01,667
Don't you know...

478
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:03,127
I already have the design plan

479
01:06:03,377 --> 01:06:05,087
of your Inframan?

480
01:06:05,546 --> 01:06:08,257
The Sun Ja doesn't work anymore.

481
01:06:10,884 --> 01:06:14,263
But you can't do any harm to him.

482
01:06:14,555 --> 01:06:15,431
I can.

483
01:06:16,056 --> 01:06:19,768
Sun Ja is produced from solar energy.

484
01:06:20,185 --> 01:06:22,479
I just have to produce water vapor which

485
01:06:22,771 --> 01:06:26,191
will condense as cloud and block the sun.

486
01:06:26,525 --> 01:06:30,821
No matter how powerful Rayma is,

487
01:06:31,071 --> 01:06:33,240
he'll be surely dead.

488
01:06:34,116 --> 01:06:36,368
You devil!

489
01:06:36,785 --> 01:06:38,120
Mutant Drill, Fire Dragon...

490
01:06:38,370 --> 01:06:39,788
Get me the Inframan Rayma.

491
01:06:40,956 --> 01:06:42,499
He'll have no reason to turn me down.

492
01:10:03,033 --> 01:10:05,744
Rayma, allow me to show you some of my power!

493
01:11:18,442 --> 01:11:20,068
Inframan!

494
01:12:05,614 --> 01:12:08,784
Rayma, let's see how powerful I am.

495
01:12:11,578 --> 01:12:12,412
Sun Ja

496
01:12:17,167 --> 01:12:20,003
Sun Ja? It's not working anymore.

497
01:12:32,682 --> 01:12:34,935
Rayma, your Sun Ja is gone.

498
01:12:35,227 --> 01:12:36,686
What else do you have?

499
01:12:53,870 --> 01:12:54,746
Lethal Kick!

500
01:13:46,965 --> 01:13:47,841
Lethal Kick.

501
01:13:57,100 --> 01:13:58,685
Good! Liu Yingde,

502
01:13:58,977 --> 01:14:01,479
your Inframan is really good.

503
01:14:02,022 --> 01:14:04,357
But don't feel happy too early.

504
01:14:04,566 --> 01:14:06,151
Now we'll see how Rayma

505
01:14:06,401 --> 01:14:07,611
will be killed by us.

506
01:14:14,701 --> 01:14:16,036
Rescue Professor Liu. I'll take care of this.

507
01:14:16,286 --> 01:14:17,078
Okay.

508
01:14:27,714 --> 01:14:29,591
Rayma

509
01:14:29,841 --> 01:14:31,801
Rayma, you never expected...

510
01:14:32,093 --> 01:14:33,678
you'll be in my hands, did you!

511
01:14:34,971 --> 01:14:37,474
I'll destroy you today.

512
01:14:38,308 --> 01:14:40,310
Rayma...Rayma...

513
01:14:55,533 --> 01:14:57,786
Professor Liu, your work

514
01:14:58,036 --> 01:15:00,580
will be burned with heat of 6000 degrees.

515
01:15:02,332 --> 01:15:03,291
However...

516
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:06,294
you could certainly make a replica

517
01:15:07,504 --> 01:15:12,717
Not for human beings, but for me.

518
01:15:13,426 --> 01:15:16,054
Devil, you can kill, but never expect me

519
01:15:16,596 --> 01:15:18,932
to produce killing weapons for you.

520
01:15:19,224 --> 01:15:21,726
Shut up. Skeleton, bring him inside.

521
01:15:34,322 --> 01:15:35,156
Inside.

522
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:45,250
Professor Liu, willing or not,

523
01:15:45,458 --> 01:15:47,711
with the glacier air,

524
01:15:47,961 --> 01:15:49,045
within 3 days,

525
01:15:49,295 --> 01:15:51,339
both of you will transform into icemen!

526
01:15:52,757 --> 01:15:53,550
Power!

527
01:18:15,817 --> 01:18:16,568
Laser Blade.

528
01:19:45,657 --> 01:19:46,407
Lethal Kick.

529
01:20:03,049 --> 01:20:06,511
Rayma, you'll be dead.

530
01:20:07,553 --> 01:20:09,472
Show me all you've got

531
01:22:14,097 --> 01:22:16,682
Rayma, you're fire, water...

532
01:22:16,933 --> 01:22:19,602
and thunder resistant.

533
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:23,147
But you can't resist the glacier air

534
01:22:23,398 --> 01:22:25,233
which freezes your body now.

535
01:22:42,667 --> 01:22:44,961
Skeleton, bring him inside

536
01:22:45,253 --> 01:22:48,965
and bury him under the glacier.

537
01:22:58,558 --> 01:23:02,770
Rayma, if you face with extreme coldness,

538
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:07,650
use the 5 Fire Bombs to cope with it

539
01:23:07,900 --> 01:23:09,152
and re-charge your power.

540
01:23:33,301 --> 01:23:34,135
Lethal Kick

541
01:24:32,443 --> 01:24:33,236
Laser Blade

542
01:24:48,876 --> 01:24:49,669
Thunder Fist

543
01:25:08,354 --> 01:25:09,146
Laser Beam

544
01:25:26,163 --> 01:25:28,416
Professor, go.

545
01:26:51,874 --> 01:26:55,294
Professor Liu, will the monster come back?

546
01:26:56,253 --> 01:26:57,963
Linlin, we now have the Inframan and so...

547
01:26:58,214 --> 01:26:59,590
whatever monster it is, we don't have to be scared.
