20
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,589
你看到那位大和尚了嗎
See that senior monk?

21
00:04:58,424 --> 00:04:59,967
他就是護廟的韋陀
He's the temple guardian.

22
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:01,927
有他守在這兒
As long as he's on duty,

23
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,513
閒雜人等休想越雷池半步
outsiders dare not set foot here.

24
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:21,030
師傅
Brother.

25
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:24,533
請這邊走  我帶路
Please follow me.

26
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,057
誰
Who is he?

27
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:58,876
慧思師傅
Brother Hui Ssu.

28
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,430
慧思師傅
Brother Hui Ssu.

29
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,698
三位施主
Welcome!

30
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:05,850
這是小妾
This is my concubine.

31
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,159
如夫人
Madame.

32
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,986
文居士
Esquire Wen,

33
00:06:09,086 --> 00:06:11,606
師父特地派貧僧來恭迎三位施主
the Abbot sent me to welcome you.

34
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:12,748
不敢當
Thank you!

35
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,959
我一接到老禪師的信
When I received the Abbot's letter

36
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:17,544
馬上就趕來了
I rushed right over.

37
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,546
他老人家的身子怎麼樣了
How is the old master?

38
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:21,840
不太好
Not well.

39
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,718
前天痰上來了  一度昏迷不醒
He had a fainting spell two days ago,

40
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:26,762
今天好了點兒
but he's a little better today.

41
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,723
大概離西遊之際不遠了
I'm afraid his time is not long.

42
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,330
這就是天下聞名的三寶寺
This is the famous Three Treasures Temple.

43
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,796
這廟裡有哪三件寶物啊
What are the "three treasures"?

44
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:06,427
這三寶不是世俗所說的寶物
Not worldly but spiritual treasures:

45
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:09,388
是佛家所謂的佛  法  僧
the Buddha, the Dharma and the monastic community.

46
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:10,681
我不懂那些個
I don't understand.

47
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,142
你說的那個什麼玄
Do you mean Tripitaka's...?

48
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:16,937
玄奘法師手抄的《大乘起信論》殘卷
The Mahayana Sutra in Tripitaka's own hand.

49
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,897
那值多少錢吶
How much is it worth?

50
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:22,943
無價之寶
It's priceless.

51
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:26,280
我帶來了一些關東老山參
I've brought aged ginseng from the north.

52
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,115
也許有點兒用處
Perhaps it can help the Abbot.

53
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,491
盡人事吧
Many thanks!

54
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:32,411
師父叫貧僧帶口信給居士
The Abbot told me to inform you

55
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,496
他老人家想在西遊之前
that before he dies,

56
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,331
選出一位新住持
he must name a successor.

57
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:38,625
因為三寶寺廟大人多
Because we've so many worthy monks,

58
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,462
就請了幾位方外的朋友  來商量商量
he's asked lay friends to assist him.

59
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:43,672
除了我之外  還請了些什麼人
Who else has he invited?

60
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,049
這就不清楚了
I don't know.

61
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:55,767
師父叫貧僧特地向居士致意
The Abbot also thanks you

62
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,978
這幾年
for all the donations

63
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,605
居士佈施三寶寺不下十萬兩銀子
you've given us over the years

64
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,190
又處處照應廟裡的和尚
and your warm support.

65
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,233
這點兒小意思  不要提了
Don't mention it.

66
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:26,882
師父還有個請求
The Abbot has another request.

67
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:32,012
- 是不是還要  - 不不不  廟裡能維特
- Does the temple need more...? - No, we're financially sound.

68
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,181
師父請求居士
He asks you

69
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:37,893
對將來選出的新住持多多照應
to lend your support to the new abbot.

70
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,186
一定一定
But of course.

71
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,027
慧思師傅
Brother Hui Ssu.

72
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:50,239
依你看  老禪師想傳衣缽給誰呢
Who do you expect him to choose?

73
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:55,619
傳法大事  貧僧不敢妄加揣測
It's not for me to speculate.

74
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,715
- 管家  把東西交給他們  - 是
- Let them take your luggage. - Yes, sir!

75
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,467
- 帶管家到廂房  - 是
- Take the valet to his room. - Yes, sir!

76
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:46,813
請
This way.

77
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,366
兩位歇一會兒  齋飯馬上就送來
Your meal will be served shortly.

78
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,660
好  你去忙吧  不要招呼了
Thank you. You're dismissed.

79
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,218
吃飯吶
Let's eat.

80
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:09,438
你先吃  我就來
Go ahead. I'll just be a minute.

81
00:14:24,556 --> 00:14:25,632
走
Hurry!

82
00:16:27,679 --> 00:16:28,697
上去
Up there!

83
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,591
是這兒
There it is!

84
00:16:54,706 --> 00:16:55,782
走
Come on!

85
00:18:06,486 --> 00:18:07,537
走
Hurry!

86
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:40,702
( 僧俗止步 )
( No Admittance )

87
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,508
大概是這兒  你給我看著點兒
It must be here somewhere. Keep watch!

88
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:54,642
好
OK.

89
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:09,900
怎麼樣
Find it?

90
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,000
沒有啊
No!

91
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,374
那本經是什麼樣的
What does it look like?

92
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:14,876
聽說是個長手卷
It's a long scroll.

93
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:17,295
你等一等
Wait...

94
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,700
那門好像沒鎖上啊
The door's unlocked.

95
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,200
門沒鎖上  不會吧
Unlocked? It can't be.

96
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,900
咱們過去看看去
Let's take a look.

97
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:02,714
- 你看  - 沒鎖啊
- Look! - It's open!

98
00:23:02,814 --> 00:23:04,850
- 快去告訴二師哥吧  - 噢
- Hurry, tell Brother Hui Wen. - OK.

99
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:12,850
二師哥
Brother Hui Wen!

100
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,300
二師哥
Brother Hui Wen!

101
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,500
什麼事
What is it?

102
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,600
那個藏經樓的門沒鎖
The Scripture Hall door is unlocked.

103
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:20,066
噢  是我開的
Yes, I opened it.

104
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:22,026
- 那就不用鎖了  - 唉
- Then left it unlocked? - Yes.

105
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:28,350
怎麼樣
What'd he say?

106
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,950
二師哥說不用鎖了
He said to leave it open.

107
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,382
走這邊
This way.

108
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,029
您這一路上辛苦了
Was it a trying journey?

109
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,150
哪裡
Not so bad.

110
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:06,005
二位施主
Good day.

111
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,188
扛到客房去
Take the luggage to the guest rooms.

112
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:31,497
施主
Madame!

113
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:34,909
那邊
Over there!

114
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:45,770
怎麼
What is it?

115
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:47,855
奇怪
Strange!

116
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,885
慧通師傅  這是誰
Brother Hui Tung, who is that?

117
00:25:53,115 --> 00:25:54,550
文安新娶的如夫人
Esquire Wen's new concubine.

118
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:55,650
文安
Esquire Wen?

119
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,918
就是那個江東的那個大財主
The wealthy landowner from Chiang Tung?

120
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,141
我認識他
I know him.

121
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:03,563
想不到
Unbelievable!

122
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:05,398
你認識這個女人
You know the woman?

123
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:06,649
認識
Yes.

124
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:08,776
誰
Who is she?

125
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:10,570
女飛賊白狐
She's called White Fox. A thief.

126
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:12,738
女飛賊  不會吧
A thief? Are you sure?

127
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:27,687
是她
It's her.

128
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:30,131
將軍  您瞧見沒有
Did you see it, General?

129
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:32,091
她身上還帶著百合鎖
She has a master key.

130
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,303
這我倒沒留神
Oh? I didn't notice.

131
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:45,146
我在關外當差的時候抓過她
I arrested her once in the north,

132
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,897
押在半路  她跑了
but she escaped.

133
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:50,818
我和文安雖然是泛泛之交
I don't know Esquire Wen very well,

134
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,695
可是他娶了一個女飛賊
but I should inform him

135
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,447
我應該告訴他一聲
that he has married a thief.

136
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,325
慧通師傅  你去約一約文安
Brother Hui Tung, please arrange a meeting.

137
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,500
好
Very well!

138
00:26:58,743 --> 00:26:59,910
等一等  將軍
General, wait!

139
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,120
怎麼
What is it?

140
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:04,915
這裡邊大概另有文章
There's more to this than meets the eye.

141
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:09,545
你也太沉不住氣了
You were too careless.

142
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,900
我來這鬼地方
You brought me here

143
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,800
就是為了給你偷那本破書
to steal that damn scroll for you.

144
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,500
要不然我來幹什麼
So what was I supposed to do?

145
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,385
那你得慢慢來呀
Wait for the right time!

146
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,264
這麼大個廟  吃這種玩意兒
This temple food is awful!

147
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:23,976
連廟裡的人都吃這個
Everyone here eats the same food.

148
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:26,270
修行的人不能講究享樂
Those leading spiritual lives for ego luxuries.

149
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:28,305
我又不修行
I'm not leading a spiritual life!

150
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,024
你從小就不幹好事
Given your history,

151
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,609
實在應該修行修行
perhaps you should!

152
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:32,860
你少扯閒片兒
Nonsense!

153
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:34,820
我就不明白
I don't understand...

154
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:37,448
你家財萬貫  要什麼有什麼
With your wealth you can buy anything.

155
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,158
還要那本破書幹什麼
What do you want with a ragged old scroll?

156
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:42,828
你懂什麼
What do you know?

157
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:48,542
這是當年大唐玄奘法師
It's the Mahayana Sutra,

158
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:51,295
親手抄的《大乘起信論》
hand-copied by the great monk Tripitaka.

159
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:52,922
是無價之寶
It's priceless.

160
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,424
多少錢也買不到
Money can't buy it.

161
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:57,093
又不能當飯吃
What good is it?

162
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:04,767
這本卷子  普天下就這麼一份
It's one of a kind.

163
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:07,978
我想了好幾年了
I've long dreamed of possessing it.

164
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:12,316
好  我盡快把經給你弄到手
I'll get it for you as soon as I can

165
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:14,110
早點兒離開這個鬼地方
and then get the hell out of here.

166
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:15,569
我老實告訴你
I'm telling you,

167
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:17,029
我不願意在這兒耗著
I don't want to hang around this dump!

168
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,742
你可別胡來  我有一定的步驟
Don't be rash. I've got a plan.

169
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,327
我可沒有這個耐心玩
Forget it! I'm getting out of here!

170
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,247
這樣吧  我把錢退給你
I'll give you your money back.

171
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:28,332
我先走  你另請高明
Hire someone else. I quit.

172
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:32,128
你何必這麼大火呢
Why are you so angry?

173
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,797
本來嘛  我就不喜歡拖拖拉拉的
I don't like waiting around!

174
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:35,923
好了  好了  快吃飯吧
OK, OK!

175
00:28:36,457 --> 00:28:37,675
你幹什麼你
Hey! Keep your hands off!

176
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,844
我告訴你  你有錢  我給你偷書
You paid me to steal the scroll

177
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:41,020
少來別的
and that's all you'll get!

178
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:46,392
你可真是三貞九烈啊
So now you're a lady of virtue, eh?

179
00:28:46,542 --> 00:28:47,601
你少廢話
Shut up!

180
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:49,145
咱可是有言在先
We had an understanding, didn't we?

181
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:50,771
我是賣藝不賣身
I sell my skills, not my body!

182
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,398
可不能老尺加一啊
I'm not a whore!

183
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,109
你小聲點兒行不行
Keep it down, will you?

184
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:56,902
- 怕什麼  - 姑奶奶
- Why should I? - Please, my lady.

185
00:29:05,895 --> 00:29:06,895
誰呀
Who is it?

186
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:08,247
是貧僧
It's me.

187
00:29:12,118 --> 00:29:13,127
慧文師傅
Brother Hui Wen.

188
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,336
施主
Greetings.

189
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:21,218
我給你引薦引薦
Come, I'll introduce you.

190
00:29:30,895 --> 00:29:32,146
這位是慧文師傅
This is Brother Hui Wen.

191
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:37,151
剛才在藏經樓  已見過如夫人了
We've already met... at the Scripture Hall.

192
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:40,654
還好  慧文師傅是自己人
Fortunately, he's our friend.

193
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:43,491
現在是智嚴老住持的二弟子
He's the Abbot's number two disciple

194
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:46,160
將來是三寶寺的新住持
and will very likely be the next abbot.

195
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:49,163
可千萬不要這麼說
We can't be certain of that!

196
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:51,457
你放心好了
Don't worry.

197
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:55,669
我的話在老住持面前  多少有點份量
My words carry weight with the Abbot.

198
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:59,507
你們二位談公事  我失陪了
I'll leave you two to your business.

199
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:00,983
好
Fine.

200
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:04,720
施主的話自然是一言九鼎了
Your support is invaluable.

201
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:07,264
貧僧的信  您收到了嗎
Did you get my letter?

202
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:09,183
收到了
Yes.

203
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:13,896
十成的把握不敢說  七八成總有
I can almost guarantee you the position.

204
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:16,816
我的信  你也收到了吧
Did you receive my letter?

205
00:30:16,941 --> 00:30:18,108
收到了
Yes.

206
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:21,821
萬一貧僧要是接了衣缽
If I become the new abbot,

207
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:24,490
那本卷子一定奉上
the scroll is yours!

208
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,326
好  咱們一言為定
Then it's a deal!

209
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,870
我們做生意的人  講究的就是信用
We businessmen place trust above all.

210
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,372
等一會兒我到老住持那兒
I'll speak to the Abbot in a bit.

211
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:32,873
給你探探口氣
I'll sound him out for you.

212
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:35,668
也不能操之過急
Please, don't be hasty.

213
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:38,420
王將軍大力推薦師哥啊
General Wang is pressing Hui Tung's case!

214
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:40,381
王驥是武人
Wang's a soldier, not a scholar.

215
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,633
老住持不一定聽他的
The Abbot won't necessarily heed his counsel.

216
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:44,677
但願如此
Let's hope not.

217
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,620
我告辭了
I must be going.

218
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,763
好
OK.

219
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:52,142
還有
One more thing:

220
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:57,523
如夫人到處逛逛  倒是無所謂
your concubine may move freely about,

221
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,775
就是要不著痕跡
but she mustn't arouse suspicion.

222
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,201
有人
Someone's outside.

223
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:23,943
金鎖
Gold Lock!

224
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,303
過來
Over here!

225
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,050
不要追了
Let him go.

226
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,150
是
Yes.

227
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,948
這是誰呀
Who is he?

228
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:56,035
這就是天下聞名的悟外法師
He's the famous Master Wu Wai.

229
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:08,230
他是幹什麼的
What is he known for?

230
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:09,757
他是維摩詰一類的人
He's a devoted lay Buddhist.

231
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,860
我不懂
I don't get it.

232
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,260
他雖沒出家  可是精通佛法
Although he's a layman, he knows

233
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,637
道行比一般和尚都高啊
the sutras better than most monks do!

234
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,902
他信佛  怎麼還帶一大堆女人
Then what's he doing with all those women?

235
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,905
到他這境界  已經心中無色了
He's immune to sensual pleasures.

236
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:36,325
我才不相信呢  我看他是個老色迷呀
Him? He looks like an old lecher.

237
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:40,079
別胡說  當今皇上都要讓他三分
Nonsense! Even the emperor defers to him.

238
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:57,262
放
Halt!

239
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:57,823
你來了  好極了
It's so good you've come!

240
00:35:57,948 --> 00:35:59,074
老禪師
Your Reverence!

241
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,744
起來  快起來
Arise, arise!

242
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:28,395
起身
Get up!

243
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:44,745
文公子
Esquire Wen.

244
00:36:46,747 --> 00:36:48,916
王將軍  久違了
General Wang, it's been a while.

245
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:50,792
總有一年多沒見了
Over a year since we last met.

246
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:03,430
這位悟外法師的氣派  可真不小
Master Wu Wai travels in style, doesn't he?

247
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:12,856
我看悟外法師
I believe he too has come here

248
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,275
大概也是為傳衣缽而來
for the succession.

249
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:16,944
也許
Perhaps.

250
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:20,906
你看這衣缽應該傳給誰
Who do you think will be chosen?

251
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:23,367
將軍看呢
Who do you think?

252
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:28,872
我看是非慧通師傅莫屬
Brother Hui Tung, without a doubt.

253
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:35,045
慧通師傅確實很有謀略
Brother Hui Tung is very clever.

254
00:37:58,402 --> 00:37:59,478
你過來
Over here.

255
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,113
交給我
Give it to me.

256
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:02,322
這是悟外居士的葷菜
This food is for Master Wu Wai.

257
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,032
我知道  你交給我吧
I know. Now give it to me!

258
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,120
你去吧
Go on!

259
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:13,417
老禪師心目中是什麼人
Who will Your Reverence pick?

260
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:16,545
這些日子心神不定
My mind is unsteady these days

261
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,673
大概這個臭皮囊不頂事了
and my old body is failing me.

262
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:23,969
所以才急著找你來商量商量
That is why I seek your advice.

263
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,856
主持這麼大的廟不容易
The temple is a huge responsibility.

264
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,567
如果選錯了人
If I choose unwisely,

265
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:41,320
將來必起爭端
disputes will arise.

266
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,656
這趟我還請了王驥和文安來了
General Wang and Esquire Wen have also come.

267
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:46,867
萬一將來起爭端
If there is a disagreement,

268
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:49,995
他們也好出頭說幾句話
they can arbitrate.

269
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:54,333
那麼在人選方面  是否有個範圍
What are your criteria for choosing the new abbot?

270
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:55,876
沒有
I have none.

271
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:59,212
我想了好幾天了
It doesn't matter...

272
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,718
不論是僧是俗
...whether he is a monk or a layman,

273
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:08,221
只要有慧根就能傳法度人
so long as he is enlightened.

274
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:14,719
慧思
Hui Ssu,

275
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:18,190
你去把法師的葷菜拿來
go and fetch Master Wu Wai's meal.

276
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:19,374
是
Will do.

277
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:27,632
師哥
Brother Hui Tung.

278
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:32,245
我正要給法師拿葷菜
I'm delivering Master Wu Wai's meal.

279
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:36,208
我送進去  你去沏茶
I'll take it. You prepare a pot of tea.

280
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:40,796
是
OK.

281
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,858
那麼老禪師準備什麼時候傳衣缽呢
Your Reverence, when are you planning to choose a successor?

282
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:03,443
就這幾天
In a few days.

283
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:06,279
不過我還有點兒俗事未了
But there's a worldly matter to attend to first.

284
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:10,826
有個流犯買了度牒  在這裡出家
A convict has purchased a permit to become a monk here.

285
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:23,422
歇會吧
Let's take a rest.

286
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,734
這兒沒人  卸了吧
Nobody's around. I'll take it off.

287
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:55,287
謝謝你  老大爺
Thank you, officer!

288
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:56,705
謝什麼
Not at all.

289
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:59,458
咱們相聚一場  就是有緣呢
We've been through a lot together.

290
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:05,505
- 這是邱明吧  - 是
- Is this Chiu Ming? - Yes.

291
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,215
這是三寶寺的文書
Here's the document you need.

292
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,053
智嚴師傅在不在
May I see the Abbot?

293
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:14,764
師父交代過  你把人交給我就行了
The Abbot sent me to take charge of him.

294
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:20,103
好吧兄弟  你就在廟裡好好修行
Make good use of your time here, friend.

295
00:41:20,604 --> 00:41:21,646
咱們再見了
Perhaps we'll meet again.

296
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,065
老大爺
Officer!

297
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:28,111
我也沒什麼話好說了
I don't know how to thank you!

298
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:31,448
起來  不要這樣
Please don't. Get up!

299
00:41:42,901 --> 00:41:43,977
跪下
Kneel.

300
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:55,180
這位是師父  那位是悟外法師
This is the Abbot and this is Master Wu Wai.

301
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:00,310
弟子邱明  參見師父
I bow to you, Reverence.

302
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:07,108
誰是你師父
Who is your master?

303
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,610
你就是我師父
You are my master.

304
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:23,500
你是來出家的  還是來避禍的
Do you sincerely wish to become a monk?

305
00:42:23,667 --> 00:42:24,751
出家
I do.

306
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:27,379
你是充軍發配的流犯
You are a convicted criminal.

307
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,200
犯的什麼罪
What are you charged with?

308
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:30,750
盜竊
Theft.

309
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:34,386
你犯了偷戒
So you did transgress.

310
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:40,225
弟子沒犯戒  被人陷害
No. I was falsely accused.

311
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,601
誰陷害
By whom?

312
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:43,103
指揮張誠
Lieutenant Chang Cheng.

313
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:47,691
張誠怎麼陷害你
How did that happen?

314
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:49,609
家兄是書館刻工
My brother was a woodblock printer.

315
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:52,696
家裡藏著一部咸通版的《金剛經》
Our family owned a rare edition of the Diamond Sutra.

316
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:54,072
張誠想買
Chang Cheng wanted to buy it.

317
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:55,615
家兄不肯
My brother wouldn't sell it.

318
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,577
張誠就羅織以偷竊罪
So Chang Cheng accused us of theft.

319
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:03,498
你起來
Arise.

320
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:15,176
後來呢
And then?

321
00:43:15,677 --> 00:43:18,013
當堂用非刑打死家兄
He beat my brother to death in court

322
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,056
弟子叛了個充軍
and I was sentenced to serve in the army.

323
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:21,766
你見過張誠嗎
Have you ever met Chang Cheng?

324
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:23,176
沒有
No.

325
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:34,362
如果你見了他  你怎麼辦
If you happened to meet him, what would you do?

326
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,323
不怎麼辦
Nothing.

327
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:39,034
你不怨
You bear no grudge?

328
00:43:45,874 --> 00:43:48,918
你先把這廟裡的地洗乾淨吧
Start by mopping the temple floor.

329
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:09,731
去叫人來抬貨啊
Go and get the goods.

330
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,069
快點兒  遞過來啊
Hurry! Give it over!

331
00:44:14,194 --> 00:44:16,154
別急  別急
Calm down.

332
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:22,285
小心點兒
Be careful!

333
00:44:24,331 --> 00:44:26,331
唉  錢呢
Hey! Where's the money?

334
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,450
- 這多少錢吶  - 不少了
- Not enough! - It's plenty.

335
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:41,971
兩吊半吶  這不夠本兒啊
I'm taking a loss...

336
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:54,067
七吊  一百
Seven strings of 100...

337
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:55,527
六吊  三百二
Six strings of 320...

338
00:44:55,652 --> 00:44:57,153
六吊  九百一
Six strings of 910...

339
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:58,905
七吊  四百六
Seven strings of 460...

340
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:12,961
四吊  六百五
Four strings of 650.

341
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:14,921
停
Stop!

342
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:27,434
你怎麼又錯了
Wrong again!

343
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:30,145
就你一個人  再算一遍
You! Do it over!

344
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:49,342
文兄
Esquire Wen.

345
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:50,869
王將軍
General Wang.

346
00:48:05,008 --> 00:48:08,219
文兄  我剛才看見一件怪事
I just saw something strange.

347
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:16,019
悟外法師講經的時候
While Wu Wai was preaching, his attendants

348
00:48:16,144 --> 00:48:19,564
居然讓侍女當著和尚的面洗澡
were bathing in full view of the monks!

349
00:48:20,006 --> 00:48:21,024
在哪裡
Where?

350
00:48:21,149 --> 00:48:22,442
就在後山
Just over the hill.

351
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,195
這種弘揚佛法的辦法
This way of propagating Buddhism

352
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:27,989
倒是別開生面
is really something new.

353
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:30,466
這有點兒太過份了吧
Going a bit far, wouldn't you say?

354
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:31,910
玄妙之至
Very profound.

355
00:48:33,036 --> 00:48:34,954
我倒真想去開開眼界
I think I'll have a look.

356
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:39,792
他們還沒散  我帶你去啊
They're still there. Follow me.

357
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:40,919
好
OK.

358
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:43,400
請
Please.

359
00:48:44,631 --> 00:48:45,840
這算哪宗啊
What sect is it?

360
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:47,258
不大清楚
No idea...

361
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,345
兩位施主
Gentlemen, the Abbot...

362
00:48:53,473 --> 00:48:54,557
師父有請
will see you now.

363
00:48:57,727 --> 00:48:59,896
好  好
Very well.

364
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:02,690
這邊兒請
This way.

365
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,027
- 請  - 請
- Please. - Please.

366
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:12,659
請跟我來
Please follow me.

367
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,970
請
Please.

368
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,234
- 二位施主  - 老禪師
- Gentlemen. - Your Reverence.

369
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:54,450
師父說  昨天俗務纏身
The Abbot had matters to attend to

370
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:57,203
沒機會向二位請教  很抱歉
and couldn't see you earlier. Apologies.

371
00:49:57,704 --> 00:50:01,165
師父還問  你們二位還住得舒服吧
He hopes you're comfortable here.

372
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:03,543
很好  很好
Very much so!

373
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:10,425
師父說  將來新住持揭了示
The Abbot says, when his successor takes over,

374
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:12,051
萬一起了什麼爭執
if there's a dispute,

375
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:13,970
請二位說句公道話
he'd like you two to mediate.

376
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:15,722
老禪師  您放心
Rest assured, Reverence.

377
00:50:16,014 --> 00:50:17,348
一定遵命
We'll do as you wish.

378
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:18,641
那就好
Very well.

379
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:20,685
老禪師
Your Reverence,

380
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:22,895
不知道老禪師
which of the monks

381
00:50:23,021 --> 00:50:24,230
預備傳衣缽給哪位師傅啊
will you choose as your successor?

382
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:29,318
他們個個是佛
Each of them is worthy,

383
00:50:30,278 --> 00:50:35,116
就像水銀洩地  粒粒成圓
each is perfect in his own way.

384
00:50:42,415 --> 00:50:46,252
二位施主這些年來  幫了我不少忙
You two have done much for me over the years.

385
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:50,298
我有什麼地方能為二位效勞呢
How can I repay you?

386
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:57,805
久聞貴寶剎裡藏著一部玄奘法師手抄的《大乘起信論》
I've heard Tripitaka's handwritten Mahayana Sutra is kept here.

387
00:50:57,972 --> 00:51:00,516
不知道能不能瞻仰瞻仰
Would it be possible to see it?

388
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:02,060
這個好辦
By all means.

389
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:04,395
文施主也有興致嗎
Is Esquire Wen also interested?

390
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:07,356
早就想見識見識這個曠世之寶
I've long yearned to see the treasured scroll.

391
00:51:10,026 --> 00:51:11,486
什麼寶物
Ha! It's no treasure,

392
00:51:11,611 --> 00:51:13,780
不過是一堆爛紙
just a roll of tattered paper.

393
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:27,418
真不愧是無價之寶
It truly is a priceless treasure.

394
00:51:27,794 --> 00:51:29,587
嘆為觀止
Incomparable!

395
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:39,097
這卷子的用處是它的文意
Its true value lies in its meaning.

396
00:51:39,100 --> 00:51:40,100
當然  當然
But of course!

397
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,050
慧思師傅  帶路吧
Brother Hui Ssu, lead the way.

398
00:52:56,199 --> 00:52:57,199
走
Let's go!

399
00:54:39,527 --> 00:54:40,653
- 什麼東西啊  - 是啊
- Hey, what's that? - Indeed.

400
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:42,530
- 上去看一看  - 好
- Let's go and check it out. - Sure.

401
00:54:42,655 --> 00:54:43,906
大家等一下
Wait a second.

402
00:54:44,073 --> 00:54:45,074
什麼事嘛
What is it?

403
00:54:45,283 --> 00:54:47,451
- 快跟我上來看一看  - 看什麼
- Let's take a look. - At what?

404
00:54:48,953 --> 00:54:50,329
怎麼弄得一地都是啊
The ground's covered with them...

405
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:51,789
大家小心一點兒啊
Careful!

406
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:54,041
這大概是念珠吧
They look like prayer beads.

407
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:55,626
念珠散了
They're unstrung!

408
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,200
快來
Hurry!

409
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:59,650
來來來  大家幫忙撿一下  快點兒
Come on, pick them up!

410
00:55:07,305 --> 00:55:08,889
把撿起來的念珠交給他
Give them to him.

411
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:12,810
這兒還有
Here's one...

412
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:15,980
- 四處再找一找  - 好
- Keep looking. - OK.

413
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:17,857
這兒還有
There's more here.

414
00:55:18,566 --> 00:55:20,192
你到後門口去看看
Go and look by the back door.

415
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:26,991
- 還有沒有  - 沒有了
- Are there some more? - No.

416
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:32,538
- 這兒還有  - 拿過來啊
- There are some here. - Gather them.

417
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:36,542
- 不見了  - 找找
- They're gone. - Go look.

418
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:44,266
還有沒有啦
Any more?

419
00:55:46,469 --> 00:55:47,553
這兒還有了
Here's one more!

420
00:55:48,054 --> 00:55:50,973
你  你是什麼人
You! Who are you?

421
00:55:55,169 --> 00:55:56,178
邱明
Chiu Ming.

422
00:55:56,604 --> 00:55:57,730
邱明
Chiu Ming?

423
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:02,568
邱明
Chiu Ming?

424
00:56:08,866 --> 00:56:10,076
你以前是幹什麼的
What did you do before you came here?

425
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:11,786
充軍發配的流犯
I was sentenced to serve in the army

426
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:15,831
現在買了度牒  出家當和尚
but I bought a permit to become a monk instead.

427
00:56:16,749 --> 00:56:18,250
你既然依皈佛門
Since you're a monk now,

428
00:56:18,376 --> 00:56:19,877
為什麼還要跟女人鬼混
what are you doing with these women?

429
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:29,303
施主  說話請慎重點
Watch what you say, sir.

430
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:30,600
混帳
Outrageous!

431
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:32,972
你敢教訓我
You dare lecture me?

432
00:57:02,837 --> 00:57:04,630
真是豈有此理
This is preposterous!

433
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:31,782
快走吧  別管這件事了
Let's go! Don't be nosy.

434
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:33,909
快走  走吧
Hurry! Go!

435
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:57,800
你幹嘛
What are you doing?

436
00:57:57,900 --> 00:57:58,900
爪
The hook!

437
00:58:37,223 --> 00:58:39,016
為了那張殘卷
All for a raggedy scroll...

438
00:58:43,896 --> 00:58:44,955
坐下
Sit.

439
00:58:57,284 --> 00:59:00,955
邱明  這件事不要聲張
Chiu Ming, tell no one about this,

440
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,290
傳出去  對你不利
or it will be trouble for you.

441
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:04,708
是
Understood.

442
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:08,087
那個打你的人就是指揮張誠
The man who struck you was Chang Cheng.

443
00:59:10,548 --> 00:59:11,924
你也不用怕
Don't be afraid.

444
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:26,400
跪下
Kneel.

445
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:34,738
日後這藏經閣就歸你管
Henceforth, you shall guard the Scripture Hall.

446
00:59:34,863 --> 00:59:39,201
這  弟子恐怕擔不了這麼大的責任
The responsibility is too great for me.

447
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:40,578
你倒說說看
Why is that?

448
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,480
弟子聽說
I've heard

449
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,624
藏經樓放著玄奘法師手抄的經卷
Tripitaka's handwritten Mahayana Sutra is kept there.

450
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:47,501
萬一出了事
If something should happen to it...

451
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,753
這都是世俗之見
That is a worldly view.

452
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:52,381
那幾張破紙沒什麼了不起
The old scroll has no real value.

453
01:00:27,583 --> 01:00:28,617
師弟
Brother.

454
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:34,131
你把這人參送給悟外法師
Take this ginseng to Master Wu Wai.

455
01:00:34,250 --> 01:00:35,650
就說是文安居士送的
Tell him it's a gift from Esquire Wen.

456
01:00:35,750 --> 01:00:36,750
是
Yes.

457
01:00:40,054 --> 01:00:41,847
師弟  師弟
Brother Hui Ssu,

458
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:43,515
我有話跟你說
I'd like a word with you.

459
01:00:51,357 --> 01:00:52,608
他什麼時候剃度的
When did he take the vows?

460
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,401
今天早上
This morning.

461
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:56,820
你們上藏經樓幹什麼
Why were you two in the Scripture Hall?

462
01:00:57,112 --> 01:00:59,448
師父吩咐  以後藏經樓歸他管
The Abbot appointed him guardian of the Scripture Hall.

463
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:07,164
叫那個流犯管藏經樓
A convict guarding the scriptures...

464
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:09,500
這又是什麼禪機
What's the deeper meaning of this?

465
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:12,920
我看師父也許會傳衣缽給三師弟
Perhaps Master will choose Hui Ssu.

466
01:01:13,671 --> 01:01:15,130
不會  不會
No, he won't!

467
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:29,395
慧思太年輕
Hui Ssu is too young.

468
01:01:30,062 --> 01:01:32,690
再說這麼多年  廟產都是由你管
You've managed the temple's assets for many years.

469
01:01:32,815 --> 01:01:36,652
別人來  這法輪他推不轉啊
No one is better suited than you.

470
01:01:37,945 --> 01:01:39,238
可千萬別這麼說
Please don't say that!

471
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:41,073
這話要是叫大師哥聽見了
If Hui Tung should overhear,

472
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:42,491
可不得了啊
there'd be no end of trouble.

473
01:01:43,659 --> 01:01:45,202
你們說的都是廢話
You're both talking rubbish!

474
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:49,415
你可不能太冒失
Don't be foolhardy!

475
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:52,042
還是我的辦法好
My way is better.

476
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:54,420
我跟你說
Listen... wait...!

477
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,888
施主
Sir!

478
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:52,594
施主
Sir!

479
01:02:53,896 --> 01:02:54,938
施主
Sir!

480
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:16,627
施主  請留步
Sir, wait!

481
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:03,543
我們現在來了
Let us begin.

482
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:07,839
老禪師
Your Reverence!

483
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:17,933
我不但是您老人家方外的好朋友
I am your devoted lay friend,

484
01:06:20,227 --> 01:06:22,145
也是這裡的地方官
but I'm also governor of this district.

485
01:06:24,022 --> 01:06:26,775
這件事情我們非弄個水落石出不可
There is a matter we must get to the bottom of.

486
01:06:27,192 --> 01:06:29,152
施主有話請儘管說
Feel free to speak.

487
01:06:35,534 --> 01:06:36,618
這個人的出身
Are you aware

488
01:06:36,743 --> 01:06:38,328
您老人家知道不知道
of this man's background?

489
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,163
那你說說看
Please go on.

490
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:46,003
這個人原是鄉間無賴
He's a criminal.

491
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:49,715
偷了東西
A thief!

492
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:52,217
被抓到官廳裡  叛了個充軍
He was arrested and sentenced to the army.

493
01:06:54,886 --> 01:06:56,346
不知道哪裡弄來的錢
I don't know how he got the money

494
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:57,931
買度牒贖了罪
to buy his way out.

495
01:06:58,056 --> 01:07:00,017
這些師父都知道
His Reverence is aware of this.

496
01:07:00,267 --> 01:07:02,477
是師父親自給他剃度的
It was the Abbot himself who administered the vows.

497
01:07:05,147 --> 01:07:08,150
老禪師  您在這裡多年靜修
Your Reverence has led a spiritual life,

498
01:07:08,275 --> 01:07:09,860
不問世俗間的事情
indifferent to worldly affairs.

499
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:12,029
你說我失查
Do you question my judgment?

500
01:07:12,237 --> 01:07:13,864
不  我是說
No, no! All I'm saying is

501
01:07:13,989 --> 01:07:17,868
您老人家對他的身世也許不清楚
you may be unaware of his background.

502
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:30,672
先不管這些
But let's not dwell on that.

503
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:35,343
他要是能痛改前非  也就罷了
If he'd reformed, I'd let it go.

504
01:07:36,011 --> 01:07:37,929
可是  他賊性難改
But he's up to his old tricks!

505
01:07:39,598 --> 01:07:42,142
他有什麼不規矩的舉動
Oh? How has he erred?

506
01:07:44,895 --> 01:07:49,399
就是剛才  他到藏經樓去偷東西
He was stealing in the Scripture Hall.

507
01:07:55,363 --> 01:07:59,242
幸虧張誠看見了  他才沒能得手
Luckily, Chang Cheng was on hand to stop him.

508
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:00,719
他瞎說
It's a lie!

509
01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:05,100
老禪師
Your Reverence...

510
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:09,628
剛才的事  貧僧已經回稟過師父了
I have reported the incident to the Abbot.

511
01:08:11,296 --> 01:08:12,380
王將軍
General Wang.

512
01:08:12,714 --> 01:08:15,592
我可不可以問張指揮幾句話
May I question Lieutenant Chang?

513
01:08:16,343 --> 01:08:17,427
請
Of course.

514
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:20,889
張指揮
Lieutenant Chang.

515
01:08:21,223 --> 01:08:24,101
你怎麼知道他是去偷東西的
How do you know he was stealing?

516
01:08:25,519 --> 01:08:26,645
是這樣的
As it happens,

517
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:29,689
他鬼鬼祟祟地溜進藏經樓
I saw him sneak into the Scripture Hall.

518
01:08:29,898 --> 01:08:31,900
我就起了疑心跟進去
I grew suspicious and followed him.

519
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:34,027
我問他到這兒來幹什麼
When I asked him what he was doing,

520
01:08:34,152 --> 01:08:36,321
他支支吾吾的答不出來
he couldn't give me a straight answer.

521
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:39,533
我馬上就猜到了  他圖謀不軌
Then I knew he was up to something.

522
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:44,079
張指揮是猜到的
You guessed, Lieutenant?

523
01:08:47,207 --> 01:08:48,583
張指揮是提刑出身
Lt. Chang is an officer of the law.

524
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:50,168
對這類人最清楚了
He's familiar with the likes of Chiu Ming.

525
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:56,091
聽說張指揮在投效朝廷之前
Wasn't Lt. Chang himself an outlaw

526
01:08:56,216 --> 01:08:58,760
也在江湖上混過
before he joined the constabulary?

527
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:01,805
先不要談這些題外的話
Let's not digress.

528
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:05,600
邱明由藏經樓偷了東西出來
Chiu Ming was stealing

529
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,894
張誠問了他幾句
and Lt. Chang confronted him.

530
01:09:08,019 --> 01:09:09,938
不料他惱羞成怒
In shame and anger,

531
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:11,857
還把張誠從樓上打了下來
he threw Lt. Chang from the Scripture Hall!

532
01:09:12,107 --> 01:09:14,276
邱明  有沒有這回事
Chiu Ming! Is it true?

533
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:16,570
有
Yes.

534
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:21,658
王將軍
General Wang,

535
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:25,787
聽說張指揮的武功造詣很高啊
I've heard that Lt. Chang is a martial artist.

536
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:27,622
相當不錯
Indeed he is!

537
01:09:28,707 --> 01:09:32,377
那怎麼會讓他從樓上打下來呢
Then how is it that he was thrown down the stairs?

538
01:09:33,003 --> 01:09:35,755
不不不不  這裡是佛門淨地
No, no, no! This is a sacred place!

539
01:09:35,881 --> 01:09:38,216
我怎麼能夠跟他動武呢
I would never violate its sanctity by fighting.

540
01:09:44,264 --> 01:09:49,060
要是在外邊兒  張誠立刻就抓他歸案
Lt. Chang would've arrested him anywhere else.

541
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,566
可是  現在是在廟裡
But the temple

542
01:09:55,192 --> 01:09:57,027
就請老禪師處理吧
is under the Abbot's jurisdiction.

543
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,900
慧通
Hui Tung,

544
01:10:03,550 --> 01:10:05,950
你看應該怎麼辦
what do you think should be done?

545
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:07,996
依照廟規
According to the rules,

546
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:11,666
他犯了偷戒  應該逐出門牆
he should be expelled for thievery.

547
01:10:12,751 --> 01:10:14,628
他打了朝廷官吏
He assaulted an officer of the law

548
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:18,715
按照國法  應該把他交王將軍處置
and should be remanded to General Wang.

549
01:10:23,887 --> 01:10:26,181
慧文  你說說看
Hui Wen, what do you think?

550
01:10:31,228 --> 01:10:33,480
藏經樓一直是由弟子管
The Scripture Hall has long been my responsibility.

551
01:10:34,314 --> 01:10:38,652
邱明居然能進去  這是弟子失職
If Chiu Ming trespassed there,

552
01:10:38,777 --> 01:10:40,570
弟子應該負責
I am at fault.

553
01:10:41,071 --> 01:10:44,074
不過  弟子不明白
But I don't understand how it was

554
01:10:44,658 --> 01:10:47,118
張指揮到藏經樓去幹什麼
that Lieutenant Chang happened to be there.

555
01:10:50,372 --> 01:10:52,040
不要說這些了
Leave that aside for now.

556
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:55,252
慧思  你說說
And you, Hui Ssu?

557
01:10:55,377 --> 01:10:56,453
要重罰
Punish him!

558
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:08,390
請問三師傅  什麼理由呢
May I ask why?

559
01:11:09,474 --> 01:11:12,560
不重罰  王將軍和張指揮的氣難消
Because that's the only way to satisfy General Wang.

560
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,528
把邱明吊在藏經樓上
Bind Chiu Ming to the Scripture Hall.

561
01:11:29,244 --> 01:11:32,789
將軍  你這招惡人先告狀
General, I fear the Abbot

562
01:11:32,914 --> 01:11:34,916
智嚴老住持看穿了
is onto your scheme.

563
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:37,711
他九十多歲了  糊里糊塗的看不穿
He's a senile old man in his 90s, he won't see through it.

564
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:39,671
他一點兒也不糊塗
He's not senile in the least.

565
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:42,799
還有  悟外的話多厲害
And Wu Wai is suspicious too.

566
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:46,720
這事有點不妙
It isn't looking good.

567
01:11:47,304 --> 01:11:50,265
這件事  只有你和邱明知道
Only you and Chiu Ming know what happened.

568
01:11:51,141 --> 01:11:53,059
他現在綁在藏經樓上
He's tied to the Scripture Hall.

569
01:11:55,854 --> 01:11:58,064
等會兒你去把他一了百了
Wait a bit, then go and finish him off.

570
01:12:14,164 --> 01:12:15,240
跳下去
Jump!

571
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:27,260
施主  為什麼放我下來
Why are you freeing me?

572
01:12:27,469 --> 01:12:28,720
是文安讓我放你的
By order of Esquire Wen -

573
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:30,263
他想跟你結個善緣
he wants to befriend you.

574
01:12:30,388 --> 01:12:33,016
這樣會不會違背師父的原意
Isn't this in defiance of the Abbot's orders?

575
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:36,436
不會
Not at all.

576
01:12:40,065 --> 01:12:41,074
不妥當
It won't work.

577
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:43,434
怎麼
Why not?

578
01:12:47,072 --> 01:12:52,577
把邱明除了  於事無補啊
Killing Chiu Ming would be of no avail.

579
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:58,041
再說  廟裡出了人命
A murder while we were here

580
01:12:58,166 --> 01:13:01,753
有你我在場  傳出去不好聽吶
would reflect badly on us.

581
01:13:04,464 --> 01:13:06,591
咱們是為了那個卷子來的
We came for the scroll,

582
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:08,510
不能節外生枝
let's not complicate matters.

583
01:13:08,968 --> 01:13:10,003
也對
You're right.

584
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:12,322
那就算了
Forget it.

585
01:13:14,182 --> 01:13:16,810
將軍  你要立刻到老禪師那裡
General, go to the Abbot immediately

586
01:13:16,935 --> 01:13:19,479
替邱明講情  把他放下來
and ask him to release Chiu Ming.

587
01:13:21,356 --> 01:13:23,441
這樣可以結個善緣
You'll make a good impression.

588
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,902
我出爾反爾  這怎麼行呢
I can't go back on what I said earlier.

589
01:13:27,237 --> 01:13:28,363
行
You can!

590
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:32,033
難道讓我說
Your Reverence,

591
01:13:32,367 --> 01:13:34,702
老禪師  我昨天是在氣頭上
yesterday my anger blinded me.

592
01:13:34,828 --> 01:13:37,163
沒想到使邱明受這麼重的懲罰
I didn't think Chiu Ming would be treated so harshly.

593
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:39,666
我有點兒後悔了  你饒了他吧
Now I regret it. Can you pardon him?

594
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:43,169
將軍  他是罪有應得
General, he deserves his punishment.

595
01:13:47,215 --> 01:13:48,758
已經吊了幾個時辰了
He's been there for hours.

596
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:50,301
也夠他受的了
Surely he's suffered enough.

597
01:13:50,677 --> 01:13:53,847
不如  現在把他放下來吧
Can't he be released now?

598
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:04,190
時候不早了  將軍也該休息了
It's getting late. Perhaps the General should rest.

599
01:14:05,692 --> 01:14:07,861
好好  再說吧
We'll discuss this another time.

600
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:10,238
你送送將軍
See the General out.

601
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:11,573
是
Yes.

602
01:14:15,285 --> 01:14:16,327
我不打攪了
Goodnight.

603
01:14:16,453 --> 01:14:17,470
將軍
General...

604
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:18,500
什麼事
Yes?

605
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,730
從明天起  廟裡的和尚論經證道
Tomorrow the monks will be tested

606
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:23,543
然後推舉新住持
and a new abbot will be chosen.

607
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:26,296
到時候  想請將軍光臨指導
Please be there to advise us.

608
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:30,467
我一定來
Certainly.

609
01:15:37,367 --> 01:15:38,993
他們三個人的答卷
Gentleman, have you studied

610
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:40,662
二位都看過了吧
the three disciples' answers?

611
01:15:40,912 --> 01:15:42,372
看過了
Yes.

612
01:15:43,998 --> 01:15:45,058
都很好
All excellent.

613
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:48,419
將軍覺得怎麼樣
General, what do you think?

614
01:15:49,003 --> 01:15:51,548
看下來  他們答的都不錯
Their answers are all very good.

615
01:15:52,799 --> 01:15:53,800
過來
Approach!

616
01:16:00,807 --> 01:16:04,602
這幾天看下來  廟裡幾百位弟子
Of all the temple's monks, you three

617
01:16:04,727 --> 01:16:09,440
你們三個人論經證道成就最高
have the best knowledge of Buddhism.

618
01:16:09,566 --> 01:16:11,943
都能主持本寺的大局
Each of you is worthy of the abbot ship.

619
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:15,029
現在  請老禪師定奪
Now His Reverence must make a decision.

620
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:21,494
你們三個人到廟後邊池塘
The three of you go to the pond behind the temple

621
01:16:21,619 --> 01:16:23,913
每人打一桶清水回來
and each fetch a bucket of clear water.

622
01:16:25,081 --> 01:16:26,082
是
Will do.

623
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,692
你們的桶裡是清水嗎
Is the water in your buckets clear?

624
01:16:52,800 --> 01:16:53,800
是
Yes!

625
01:16:55,486 --> 01:16:58,114
慧通  你說說
Hui Tung, tell me

626
01:16:58,448 --> 01:17:00,700
你這清水是怎麼打的
how you got your clear water?

627
01:17:04,037 --> 01:17:06,122
弟子和師弟們同心合力
Only by working with my brothers

628
01:17:06,247 --> 01:17:07,915
才打到一桶清水
was I able to obtain clear water.

629
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:11,127
你解給我聽
Explain your answer.

630
01:17:11,836 --> 01:17:13,421
就像千溪萬水
Only when the many streams

631
01:17:13,546 --> 01:17:14,922
同歸大海
have run to the sea

632
01:17:15,048 --> 01:17:17,634
才能照出一輪明月
does it reflect the full moon.

633
01:17:44,619 --> 01:17:46,704
慧文  你呢
Hui Wen?

634
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:49,499
弟子是用細紗濾出來的
I filtered the water through fine gauze...

635
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:53,378
這就像修持有恆  澄清俗慮
for only by ridding oneself of worldly ideas

636
01:17:53,503 --> 01:17:55,296
才能返本歸真
can one rediscover his true nature.

637
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:14,232
慧思
Hui Ssu?

638
01:18:14,357 --> 01:18:15,625
聽其自然
Let nature take its course...

639
01:18:18,277 --> 01:18:19,837
心清水自清
clear heart, clear water.

640
01:20:00,963 --> 01:20:02,131
慧思
Hui Ssu!

641
01:20:04,926 --> 01:20:06,177
你過來
Come forward!

642
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:17,800
來來來
Come, come.

643
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:05,653
自從五祖弘忍之後
This is a large temple, with many monks.

644
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:09,699
為了怕起爭端  衣缽誤傳
Therefore, to avoid internal disputes,

645
01:21:10,074 --> 01:21:13,077
本寺因為廟大人多
an outsider shall become the new abbot.

646
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:17,540
仍然把架裟交給新住持  作為信物
He shall assume the mantle of leadership.

647
01:21:21,550 --> 01:21:22,600
邱明
Chiu Ming!

648
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:30,219
邱明  你過來
Chiu Ming! Come forth!

649
01:21:58,789 --> 01:21:59,832
跪下
Kneel.

650
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:28,069
從現在起  你法名上慧下明
Henceforth, you shall be called Hui Ming.

651
01:22:28,819 --> 01:22:31,238
接替我主持三寶
You shall take my place

652
01:22:31,364 --> 01:22:33,449
你要承先啟後
in upholding temple traditions

653
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:35,493
傳法度人
and propagating Buddhist doctrine.

654
01:22:35,618 --> 01:22:36,635
起來
Rise!

655
01:23:06,565 --> 01:23:07,608
現在就來吧
Now?

656
01:23:10,861 --> 01:23:14,824
從現在起  邱明就是本寺的新住持
Hui Ming has been chosen as the new abbot.

657
01:23:15,241 --> 01:23:17,368
你們要像待師父一樣的待他
Respect him as you would the old abbot.

658
01:23:18,244 --> 01:23:19,286
轉過去
Turn!

659
01:23:25,459 --> 01:23:26,585
拜
Bow.

660
01:23:55,197 --> 01:23:57,450
慧明住持升坐
Abbot Hui Ming is now in charge.

661
01:24:15,468 --> 01:24:20,347
這是萬年冊  本廟契約  帳目
These are the temple's accounts.

662
01:24:21,348 --> 01:24:23,976
不明白的地方去問慧文
Hui Wen will answer any questions you have.

663
01:24:25,519 --> 01:24:29,940
這是玄奘法師的《大乘起信論》殘卷
This is Tripitaka's Mahayana Sutra.

664
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:38,616
這張紙  多年來惹了不少是非
It has long been a source of trouble here.

665
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:40,743
你要妥為處理
Deal with it properly.

666
01:24:40,868 --> 01:24:42,203
是
Surely.

667
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:49,210
師父涅槃的時候要誦彌陀經
Tomorrow the old Abbot will retire...

668
01:24:55,758 --> 01:24:57,134
明天一早
to prepare for Nirvana.

669
01:24:57,259 --> 01:25:00,596
智嚴禪師在南山已於涅槃
We will see him off to South Mountain

670
01:25:01,013 --> 01:25:03,057
到時候  頌彌陀經
by reciting the Amitabha Sutra.

671
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05,800
豈有此理  流犯當住持
This is absurd! A convict as abbot!

672
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:07,400
這成什麼體統
It's completely inappropriate!

673
01:25:07,645 --> 01:25:10,147
沒那麼容易  不給他點兒顏色看看
He'll find it's not easy being abbot.

674
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:12,108
他也不知道我有多大道行
He still has me to reckon with!

675
01:25:12,691 --> 01:25:15,069
二位  我到前邊兒去看看
Gentlemen, please excuse me.

676
01:25:15,361 --> 01:25:16,362
請便
Very well.

677
01:25:27,414 --> 01:25:29,375
- 也真可憐  - 誰呀
- I pity him. - Who?

678
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,377
慧通白忙了一場
Hui Tung. All his efforts were in vain.

679
01:25:32,837 --> 01:25:35,005
出家人這麼熱衷權位
A monk so power hungry

680
01:25:35,131 --> 01:25:36,757
就不配當住持
isn't fit to be abbot.

681
01:25:43,222 --> 01:25:45,558
你看我要不要跟智嚴說說
Should I have a talk with the old abbot?

682
01:25:45,958 --> 01:25:47,034
說什麼呀
About what?

683
01:25:48,853 --> 01:25:51,188
請他改派慧通當住持
To suggest he appoint Hui Tung instead.

684
01:25:51,397 --> 01:25:52,439
什麼理由
On what grounds?

685
01:25:52,898 --> 01:25:55,359
就說  我是地方官
As district governor I won't allow

686
01:25:55,484 --> 01:25:59,155
在我治內的廟裡  由一個流犯當住持
a convict to serve as abbot.

687
01:25:59,446 --> 01:26:00,698
我不能同意
I simply won't allow it.

688
01:26:02,476 --> 01:26:03,476
千萬不要
Don't do it!

689
01:26:03,576 --> 01:26:06,495
現在最要緊的是籠絡邱明
We have to win Chiu Ming over now.

690
01:26:07,705 --> 01:26:10,291
他現在恨你我入骨  怎麼籠絡
How? He hates our guts.

691
01:26:13,794 --> 01:26:14,795
我去
I'll see to it.

692
01:26:21,302 --> 01:26:23,137
過來  大夥兒都過來
Over here! Gather around.

693
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:24,500
大師哥有話跟你們說
Hui Tung has something to say.

694
01:26:36,700 --> 01:26:37,800
你們聽我說啊
Listen...

695
01:26:37,900 --> 01:26:38,900
怎麼
Huh?

696
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,200
聽大師哥講
Listen to Hui Tung.

697
01:26:40,362 --> 01:26:42,531
你們可千萬別把這事告訴別人
Speak of this to no one!

698
01:26:43,073 --> 01:26:45,492
等會兒  你帶頭去見住持
Lead them to the new abbot.

699
01:26:46,452 --> 01:26:48,579
你們就說吃不飽  菜不夠
Tell him you're not getting enough to eat

700
01:26:48,704 --> 01:26:50,456
沒油水  手腳發軟
and you're weak from hunger.

701
01:26:50,581 --> 01:26:52,458
撒開了跟他吵  不用怕
Raise a ruckus. I'll back you up.

702
01:26:52,583 --> 01:26:54,835
行  給他來個下馬威
Come on! Let's give him hell!

703
01:26:55,377 --> 01:26:56,795
就這麼著了  我先走了
Good. I'll leave it to you.

704
01:26:56,921 --> 01:26:57,996
你放心
Count on us!

705
01:27:18,192 --> 01:27:19,860
今天還有什麼事嗎
Is there any other business today?

706
01:27:21,737 --> 01:27:23,656
早上抓到一個山賊  在前院
We captured a smuggler this morning.

707
01:27:25,741 --> 01:27:26,775
住持
Your Reverence.

708
01:27:31,038 --> 01:27:33,123
張指揮  有什麼事嗎
What is it, Lieutenant?

709
01:27:34,917 --> 01:27:38,629
上一次的事兒  實在是出於誤會
What happened between us earlier

710
01:27:38,837 --> 01:27:40,798
讓住持受了點兒委屈
was a misunderstanding.

711
01:27:42,216 --> 01:27:44,051
我一直耿耿於懷
I'm sorry you suffered for it.

712
01:27:48,889 --> 01:27:51,642
那件事  貧僧早就忘了
I've already forgotten it

713
01:27:51,976 --> 01:27:53,769
施主千萬不要掛在心上
and I hope you'll forget it too.

714
01:27:58,649 --> 01:28:01,694
還有件事兒  我不知道應不應該說
There's something else you should know.

715
01:28:02,653 --> 01:28:04,405
施主有話儘管說
Please speak freely, sir.

716
01:28:04,863 --> 01:28:09,076
貴寶寺的伙食  實在太
The food here is...

717
01:28:10,577 --> 01:28:11,620
什麼
What?

718
01:28:16,667 --> 01:28:19,128
貴寶寺的伙食  一向很差
The food here in the temple is awful.

719
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:21,046
和尚們都有怨言
All the monks are complaining.

720
01:28:21,839 --> 01:28:24,842
剛才我聽到慧通師傅煽風點火
I just overheard Hui Tung inciting them

721
01:28:24,967 --> 01:28:27,386
叫大夥兒都跟住持來鬧事
to confront you about it.

722
01:28:27,511 --> 01:28:29,179
我特地來給您送個信
I've come to let you know

723
01:28:29,305 --> 01:28:30,597
你心裡要有個底
so you won't be taken by surprise.

724
01:28:31,515 --> 01:28:32,891
我們吃不飽怎麼行呢
How can you let us starve?

725
01:28:34,476 --> 01:28:35,811
這有什麼關係
What does it matter?

726
01:28:35,936 --> 01:28:36,937
我們真要這麼辦啊
What if it goes too far?

727
01:28:37,062 --> 01:28:38,188
有大師哥兜著了  怕什麼
Don't worry! Hui Tung will back us up!

728
01:28:38,314 --> 01:28:39,315
是呀
Yes!

729
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:41,358
那到時候  要是他不認帳呢
What if he doesn't?

730
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:43,485
最多還俗  不幹了
We'll leave the monk hood!

731
01:28:44,695 --> 01:28:46,488
你說得倒容易  還俗吃什麼
Easy to say! How would we get by?

732
01:28:46,613 --> 01:28:48,282
到哪兒去混兩頓粥還不容易
A bowl of gruel isn't hard to come by.

733
01:28:48,407 --> 01:28:49,783
你們那麼三心兩意的
If you two want to back out,

734
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:52,036
咱們這齣戲  乾脆甭唱了
let's just forget it!

735
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:04,173
住持  我們有點兒事  想跟您談一談
Your Reverence! We'd like a word with you.

736
01:29:07,634 --> 01:29:08,761
好
Very well.

737
01:29:13,932 --> 01:29:15,225
是不是伙食的事
Is it about the food?

738
01:29:15,351 --> 01:29:16,727
是
Yes!

739
01:29:19,772 --> 01:29:20,939
你還要跟著吵啊
You still want to go through with it?

740
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:26,362
住持  大伙吃什麼  你也知道
Master, you know what we eat.

741
01:29:26,487 --> 01:29:28,405
- 我知道  - 沒菜  沒油水
- I do. - Watery gruel,

742
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:30,032
連粥都喝不飽
and little else!

743
01:29:30,157 --> 01:29:31,450
每月都病倒了好幾個
Monks are falling sick every day!

744
01:29:31,575 --> 01:29:33,202
手腳發軟  夜裡看不見
They're weak and can't see well at night.

745
01:29:33,327 --> 01:29:34,578
什麼病啊  餓的
Sick? We're starving!

746
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:36,330
餓得我氣都發虛
Ravaged by hunger!

747
01:29:37,164 --> 01:29:38,707
幹什麼  幹什麼
What's going on here?

748
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:44,129
你們吵什麼  有什麼好吵的
What's all the shouting about?

749
01:29:54,932 --> 01:29:56,058
不要吵了
Quiet?

750
01:29:58,685 --> 01:30:01,271
伙食的事  咱們想辦法改
We'll find a way to improve the food,

751
01:30:02,439 --> 01:30:04,024
可是別的也要改
but there'll be other changes as well.

752
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:06,610
從現在起  這廟裡的和尚
From now on, monks will not spend

753
01:30:06,735 --> 01:30:08,445
不能整天唸經打坐
the entire day in contemplation.

754
01:30:08,904 --> 01:30:10,531
要種莊稼  種菜
They'll do farm work as well.

755
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:11,907
種莊稼
Plant crops?

756
01:30:12,282 --> 01:30:14,410
這和尚種莊稼  我還沒聽說過
Monks farming? Is he serious?

757
01:30:14,535 --> 01:30:15,619
別吵
Quiet!

758
01:30:16,578 --> 01:30:17,596
住持
Your Reverence,

759
01:30:17,621 --> 01:30:20,374
叫他們種地  這恐怕行不通吧
I don't think it will work.

760
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:21,942
行得通
Yes, it will.

761
01:30:26,213 --> 01:30:27,840
我們不會種莊稼
We don't know how to farm!

762
01:30:28,882 --> 01:30:30,092
不會就學
Then learn.

763
01:30:30,592 --> 01:30:31,677
跟誰學
From whom?

764
01:30:34,138 --> 01:30:35,389
跟我學
I'll teach you.

765
01:30:38,517 --> 01:30:39,643
你們去吧
Disperse now.

766
01:30:43,856 --> 01:30:45,441
那伙食還改不改
We need more food!

767
01:30:45,850 --> 01:30:47,550
我們吃不飽怎麼行呢
How can we farm on empty stomachs?

768
01:30:52,900 --> 01:30:54,300
- 人都走了  - 走了
- He's left. - Let's go.

769
01:30:57,453 --> 01:31:00,831
住持  這改伙食可不簡單吶
Solving the food problem won't be easy.

770
01:31:01,415 --> 01:31:03,125
剛才我跟您報過帳了
You've seen the temple accounts.

771
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:07,546
咱們廟裡的收入有限  花費有定數
What we take in barely covers expenses.

772
01:31:07,963 --> 01:31:11,049
這一改伙食  錢就不夠用了
We don't have the money for more food.

773
01:31:12,885 --> 01:31:14,094
那就去化緣
Then go collect alms.

774
01:31:14,761 --> 01:31:17,306
化緣的事  本來都是我去辦
I'm in charge of alms collection.

775
01:31:17,723 --> 01:31:20,559
可是年頭不好  化不動啊
Money's scarce this year!

776
01:31:22,144 --> 01:31:23,228
那就去借
Then borrow!

777
01:31:24,021 --> 01:31:25,021
住持
Your Reverence!

778
01:31:26,607 --> 01:31:28,859
那就更難了  再說借要有抵押
We've nothing to put up for collateral

779
01:31:28,984 --> 01:31:30,277
除非請文居士想辦法
unless we go to Esquire Wen.

780
01:31:30,402 --> 01:31:31,695
好  現在就去
Then go to him now.

781
01:31:35,782 --> 01:31:37,868
住持  這改伙食的事
Your Reverence, the food situation...

782
01:31:37,993 --> 01:31:39,077
明天一定改
It will be rectified tomorrow.

783
01:31:53,050 --> 01:31:54,259
就是這幾個
These are the ones.

784
01:31:55,093 --> 01:31:56,637
他們偷著喝酒  吃肉
They've been eating meat and drinking wine.

785
01:31:57,262 --> 01:31:58,931
每趟都是那個人運進來的
He's their supplier.

786
01:31:59,100 --> 01:32:00,600
今天早上給抓著了
We caught them this morning.

787
01:32:01,400 --> 01:32:02,600
他們哪兒來的錢
Where did they get the money?

788
01:32:02,726 --> 01:32:03,936
二師哥給的
From Hui Wen.

789
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:06,355
師弟  這是什麼話
Brother, what are you saying?

790
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:07,564
他們自己招的
They confessed to it.

791
01:32:07,689 --> 01:32:10,734
我叫他們採辦伙食
I sent them to buy provisions.

792
01:32:10,859 --> 01:32:13,695
我沒有叫他們去犯戒
I didn't tell them to break their vows!

793
01:32:17,824 --> 01:32:20,077
慧通  以前這種事怎麼辦
How were such matters handled in the past?

794
01:32:20,244 --> 01:32:22,079
廟裡的人罰面壁三個月
For monks, three months of solitary confinement.

795
01:32:22,200 --> 01:32:24,200
外邊兒的人  吊起來打十二板子
For laypeople, a severe caning.

796
01:32:24,300 --> 01:32:25,500
這事您交給我好了
I'll take care of it.

797
01:32:25,600 --> 01:32:27,600
好  咱們改個辦法
Fine. But we'll initiate a new procedure.

798
01:32:27,793 --> 01:32:31,088
廟裡的人  到後院把井邊那塊地剷平
Monks will go to the rear courtyard

799
01:32:31,213 --> 01:32:32,422
種上大白菜
and clear land to plant vegetables.

800
01:32:32,673 --> 01:32:34,883
那個外邊兒的人  交給張誠
Turn the smuggler over to Lieutenant Chang

801
01:32:35,092 --> 01:32:36,526
等地方官來發落
to await trial.

802
01:32:37,636 --> 01:32:38,936
- 住持  - 就這麼辦了
- Your Reverence... - Do as I say.

803
01:32:39,036 --> 01:32:40,336
你現在就去
Go now!

804
01:32:45,686 --> 01:32:47,271
- 你們要立刻辦好  - 是
- Take care of it immediately! - Yes, sir.

805
01:32:49,106 --> 01:32:50,399
你怎麼胡說八道的
How dare you defame me?

806
01:32:51,817 --> 01:32:52,817
住持
Your Reverence.

807
01:32:54,444 --> 01:32:55,444
施主
Esquire Wen.

808
01:32:56,113 --> 01:32:57,823
貧僧正要找你
I was on my way to see you.

809
01:32:58,200 --> 01:33:00,800
住持  我剛才就想過去給您道賀
And I was just on my way to congratulate you

810
01:33:00,900 --> 01:33:02,100
看見您忙
but I saw you were very busy.

811
01:33:02,200 --> 01:33:04,100
出家人不講究這些
No congratulations, please.

812
01:33:07,291 --> 01:33:08,375
施主
Esquire...

813
01:33:09,543 --> 01:33:11,545
廟裡要改善一下伙食
we want to improve the food here.

814
01:33:11,962 --> 01:33:13,380
想請施主幫幫忙
Can you help us?

815
01:33:13,505 --> 01:33:14,965
應該的  應該的
I'd help if I could,

816
01:33:15,507 --> 01:33:18,427
不過最近景況實在是緊
but as Hui Wen knows,

817
01:33:18,552 --> 01:33:19,970
二師傅知道的
I'm having difficulties myself.

818
01:33:21,096 --> 01:33:22,139
那麼
Well...

819
01:33:22,347 --> 01:33:25,100
能不能請施主  到外邊兒齋借齋借
could you help us borrow?

820
01:33:27,686 --> 01:33:30,397
放款的人多數要抵押
Lenders want collateral for loans.

821
01:33:33,817 --> 01:33:36,028
那麼就把廟裡的地契押給他們
We could mortgage the temple property.

822
01:33:37,446 --> 01:33:40,616
生意人怎麼敢收廟契呢
The lenders wouldn't accept it.

823
01:33:41,366 --> 01:33:42,484
怎麼
Why not?

824
01:33:42,868 --> 01:33:46,455
萬一不還錢  他們也不能把廟給賣了
If you defaulted, they couldn't sell the temple.

825
01:33:53,253 --> 01:33:54,504
還有別的辦法嗎
Is there any other way?

826
01:33:56,715 --> 01:33:59,301
那部玄奘法師手抄的卷子
With the Tripitaka scroll as security,

827
01:33:59,676 --> 01:34:01,219
倒能押不少錢
you could borrow a large sum.

828
01:34:05,724 --> 01:34:06,892
能押多少
How much?

829
01:34:07,476 --> 01:34:10,479
幾萬兩銀子  大概能押吧
Tens of thousands of taels of silver.

830
01:34:14,858 --> 01:34:17,903
好  你先寫一萬兩銀票給慧文
Fine. First give Hui Wen a draft for 10,000 taels.

831
01:34:18,278 --> 01:34:19,571
那部卷子
As for the scroll,

832
01:34:19,696 --> 01:34:22,866
我  我想想看
let me think about it.

833
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:26,244
這是兩萬兩銀票  一張是你的
Here are two drafts, each worth 10,000 taels.

834
01:34:27,204 --> 01:34:28,789
一張是公款
One for the temple, one for you.

835
01:34:41,802 --> 01:34:43,387
這是藏經樓的鑰匙
And here's the key to Scripture Hall.

836
01:34:43,929 --> 01:34:46,014
萬一他變卦  你再下手
If he changes his mind, resort to your original plan.

837
01:34:48,725 --> 01:34:49,785
如夫人
Madame!

838
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:03,073
現在要能到手
If they steal it,

839
01:35:03,323 --> 01:35:05,659
連一萬兩銀子都省了
it won't cost me anything.

840
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:18,400
走
Let's go.

841
01:35:23,385 --> 01:35:25,762
這將來廟裡出了人命怎麼辦呢
How can I explain a murder in the temple?

842
01:35:25,929 --> 01:35:26,930
有我呢
Leave it to me!

843
01:35:27,222 --> 01:35:29,182
無論如何  他是住持
But he's the abbot!

844
01:35:34,104 --> 01:35:35,147
你先去
You go first.

845
01:35:37,816 --> 01:35:39,234
這你該明白了吧
Understand?

846
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:44,281
指揮  我怕一個人弄不過他
On my own I'm no match for him.

847
01:35:44,406 --> 01:35:46,533
別怕  有我給你打接應
Don't worry. I've got your back.

848
01:35:49,661 --> 01:35:52,497
去吧  去去去去
Go on! Go!

849
01:36:02,282 --> 01:36:03,282
住持
Your Reverence!

850
01:36:09,347 --> 01:36:10,390
施主
Madame.

851
01:36:10,682 --> 01:36:11,683
住持
Your Reverence!

852
01:36:13,477 --> 01:36:15,771
慧通  張誠要害你  留神點兒
Hui Tung and Chang Cheng are plotting to kill you!

853
01:36:16,313 --> 01:36:17,397
施主
Madame...

854
01:36:18,398 --> 01:36:19,399
施主
Madame!

855
01:37:49,447 --> 01:37:53,118
你不用怕  馬上找點兒刀創藥擦上
Put some salve on it and you'll be fine.

856
01:37:54,119 --> 01:37:56,454
然後睡在藏經樓門口
Then go watch over the Scripture Hall tonight.

857
01:37:58,832 --> 01:38:01,418
今天晚上  藏經樓要是出了什麼事
If there's any trouble there,

858
01:38:02,252 --> 01:38:04,004
明天唯你是問
I'll hold you responsible.

859
01:38:05,100 --> 01:38:06,100
去吧
Now go!

860
01:42:14,629 --> 01:42:16,147
有沒有看見張誠
Have you seen Chang Cheng?

861
01:42:17,173 --> 01:42:18,816
走後門  河邊兒見
Go out the back. Meet me at the riverside.

862
01:42:30,061 --> 01:42:31,271
河邊兒見
See you there!

863
01:42:38,800 --> 01:42:40,000
- 將軍  - 文兄啊
- General. - Esquire Wen.

864
01:42:40,100 --> 01:42:42,778
我
I...

865
01:42:44,951 --> 01:42:47,328
我們這一趟總算是功德圓滿了
Well, this has been an eventful visit.

866
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:48,788
是呀  是呀
Indeed it has.

867
01:42:50,456 --> 01:42:52,542
將軍也是今天下山嗎
Are you leaving today too, General?

868
01:42:52,876 --> 01:42:54,750
馬上就走
Yes.

869
01:42:55,050 --> 01:42:57,350
衙門裡還有很多事情啊
I've official duties to attend to.

870
01:42:57,714 --> 01:42:59,549
那我就不另外辭行了
Then I won't delay you further.

871
01:42:59,674 --> 01:43:01,467
不要客氣  不要客氣
You're too polite!

872
01:43:02,927 --> 01:43:05,263
- 再見  - 再見  再見
- Goodbye. - Goodbye.

873
01:43:06,014 --> 01:43:07,849
- 請  - 請
- After you. - Please.

874
01:43:39,214 --> 01:43:40,298
張誠
Chang Cheng!

875
01:43:47,138 --> 01:43:48,139
張誠
Chang Cheng!

876
01:44:06,532 --> 01:44:09,369
狐盜捲逃  直追
"White Fox has scroll. In pursuit.

877
01:44:09,869 --> 01:44:11,454
河邊候駕
Await you at riverside."

878
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:14,400
河邊
Damn it!

879
01:44:14,600 --> 01:44:16,800
也不寫明河邊在哪裡
Where by the riverside?

880
01:44:37,200 --> 01:44:38,200
走
Hurry!

881
01:45:48,800 --> 01:45:49,800
快跑
Run!

882
01:49:08,500 --> 01:49:09,500
走
Run!

883
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:11,100
- 金鎖呢  - 走
- What about Gold Lock? - Run!

884
01:49:31,857 --> 01:49:32,858
張誠
Chang Cheng.

885
01:49:33,600 --> 01:49:34,900
這不是金鎖嗎
Isn't this Gold Lock?

886
01:49:40,900 --> 01:49:42,000
搜
After them!

887
01:49:42,100 --> 01:49:43,100
走
Come on!

888
01:49:57,600 --> 01:49:58,600
走
Hurry!

889
01:50:22,908 --> 01:50:25,911
老大爺  您渡我們過江好吧
I say, sir, can you ferry us across?

890
01:50:33,377 --> 01:50:35,004
我給您十兩銀子
I'll pay you 10 taels of silver.

891
01:50:38,090 --> 01:50:39,592
好  二十兩
20, then!

892
01:50:39,717 --> 01:50:40,885
好吧
All right?

893
01:50:47,166 --> 01:50:48,200
走吧
Let's go!

894
01:50:54,157 --> 01:50:55,166
快點兒開船
Hurry!

895
01:51:43,264 --> 01:51:44,273
等一等
Wait!

896
01:51:44,849 --> 01:51:47,143
- 幹嘛  - 還沒給他錢呢
- What? - You haven't paid him.

897
01:51:48,853 --> 01:51:50,112
不對
On second thought...

898
01:51:50,688 --> 01:51:52,707
這老頭一會兒告訴他們就糟了
What if he betrays us?

899
01:51:52,915 --> 01:51:54,183
不如
Better yet...

900
01:51:54,917 --> 01:51:56,118
這不大好吧
That won't do!

901
01:52:02,216 --> 01:52:04,510
老大爺  還沒給您錢呢
Old fellow, I forgot to pay you.

902
01:52:10,266 --> 01:52:13,936
老大爺  您過來  過來呀
Old fellow, over here, over here!

903
01:52:47,470 --> 01:52:50,639
二位施主  請留步
Please, sir... stop!

904
01:57:17,156 --> 01:57:18,198
施主
Esquire Wen.

905
01:57:21,618 --> 01:57:22,619
慧文師傅
Brother Hui Wen.

906
01:57:23,245 --> 01:57:24,288
文施主
Esquire Wen.

907
01:57:24,705 --> 01:57:27,374
我跟你的事  我都對住持說了
I've told the Abbot all about our plot.

908
01:57:28,584 --> 01:57:31,378
現在你在廟裡偷了東西  又殺了人
You stole and murdered on temple grounds.

909
01:57:31,795 --> 01:57:33,230
這怎麼了結呢
How will you account for that?

910
01:57:33,714 --> 01:57:35,090
是張誠先動的手啊
Chang Cheng attacked me!

911
01:57:36,133 --> 01:57:37,885
那是死無對證啊
But you've no proof of it!

912
01:57:38,100 --> 01:57:39,400
張誠是有名的酷吏
Chang Cheng was a known killer.

913
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:41,800
他一向作惡多端  死有餘辜啊
The brute got what he deserved.

914
01:57:41,900 --> 01:57:43,985
這在情理上也許說得過去
That may indeed be so,

915
01:57:44,099 --> 01:57:45,934
在國法上可講不通啊
but the law won't see it that way!

916
01:57:46,060 --> 01:57:49,480
那  那到這個地步  我
Then... what can I do?

917
01:57:50,731 --> 01:57:54,526
文施主  你還是跟我回去  求求住持
Return with me and beg for the Abbot's mercy.

918
01:57:54,651 --> 01:57:56,361
也許能夠從輕發落
Perhaps he'll be lenient.

919
01:57:57,112 --> 01:57:58,989
那  那這趟我不是白來了
So... all my efforts were in vain?

920
01:58:00,115 --> 01:58:01,575
我看是白來了
I'm afraid so.

921
01:58:03,535 --> 01:58:04,661
哎呀
Go to hell!

922
01:58:07,100 --> 01:58:08,100
文施主
Esquire Wen!

923
01:58:09,792 --> 01:58:11,794
文施主  那兒不能去啊
Esquire! Not that way...!

924
01:58:28,811 --> 01:58:30,062
這張爛紙
This tattered parchment

925
01:58:30,395 --> 01:58:33,148
多少年來是本寺禍亂之源
has caused trouble for far too long.

926
01:58:37,486 --> 01:58:40,280
現在  我把它還給玄奘法師
Now I'm returning it to Tripitaka.

927
01:59:23,031 --> 01:59:24,074
王將軍
General Wang.

928
01:59:27,244 --> 01:59:30,914
《大乘起信論》可貴之處  在它的文意
The Mahayana Sutra's true value is in its meaning.

929
01:59:31,165 --> 01:59:32,833
它應該廣為傳播
It should be available to all.

930
01:59:33,542 --> 01:59:35,711
師父早已經印好了幾十份
I've made scores of copies.

931
01:59:36,253 --> 01:59:38,714
現在  送給將軍一份
One of them for you, General.

932
02:00:01,820 --> 02:00:04,114
叫她過來  給她剃度
Call her over to take the tonsure.

933
02:00:09,750 --> 02:00:10,750
你過來
Come.

934
02:00:24,593 --> 02:00:25,802
跪下
Kneel!

935
02:00:46,000 --> 02:00:47,500
誦經
Chant the sutra.

936
02:01:10,900 --> 02:01:13,200
劇 終
THE END
