This way of propagating Buddhism

00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:30,466
Going a bit far, wouldn't you say?
这有点儿太过份了吧

Is Esquire Wen also interested?

They look like prayer beads.

407
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:55,626
They're unstrung!
念珠散了

I was sentenced to serve in the army

00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:15,831
but I bought a permit to become a monk instead.

427
00:56:16,749 --> 00:56:18,250
Since you're a monk now,

428
00:56:18,376 --> 00:56:19,877
what are you doing with these women?

429
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:29,303
Watch what you say, sir.

Chiu Ming, tell no one about this,

Henceforth, you shall guard the Scripture Hall.

446
00:59:34,863 --> 00:59:39,201
The responsibility is too great for me.
这  弟子恐怕担不了这么大的责任

447
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:40,578
Why is that?
你倒说说看

00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:42,480
I've heard
弟子听说

449
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,624
Tripitaka's handwritten Mahayana Sutra is kept there.

The old scroll has no real value.
那几张破纸没什么了不起

01:00:27,583 --> 01:00:28,617
Brother.
师弟

454
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:34,131
Take this ginseng to Master Wu Wai.

Tell him it's a gift from Esquire Wen.

This morning.
今天早上

461

The Abbot appointed him guardian of the Scripture Hall.

463
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:07,164
A convict guarding the scriptures...
叫那个流犯管藏经楼

464
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:09,500
What's the deeper meaning of this?
这又是什么禅机

465
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:12,920
Perhaps Master will choose Hui Ssu.
我看师父也许会传衣钵给三师弟

466
01:01:13,671 --> 01:01:15,130
No, he won't!
不会  不会

467
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:29,395
Hui Ssu is too young.
慧思太年轻

468
01:01:30,062 --> 01:01:32,690
You've managed the temple's assets for many years.
再说这么多年  庙产都是由你管

469
01:01:32,815 --> 01:01:36,652
No one is better suited than you.
别人来  这法轮他推不转啊

470
01:01:37,945 --> 01:01:39,238
Please don't say that!
可千万别这么说

471
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:41,073
If Hui Tung should overhear,
这话要是叫大师哥听见了

472
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:42,491
there'd be no end of trouble.
可不得了啊

473
01:01:43,659 --> 01:01:45,202
You're both talking rubbish!
你们说的都是废话

474
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:49,415
Don't be foolhardy!
你可不能太冒失

475

I am your devoted lay friend,

484
01:06:20,227 --> 01:06:22,145
but I'm also governor of this district.

485
01:06:24,022 --> 01:06:26,775
There is a matter we must get to the bottom of.
这件事情我们非弄个水落石出不可

486
01:06:27,192 --> 01:06:29,152
Feel free to speak.

of this man's background?

He was arrested and sentenced to the army.

to buy his way out.
买度牒赎了罪

His Reverence is aware of this.
这些师父都知道

496
01:07:00,267 --> 01:07:02,477
It was the Abbot himself who administered the vows.
是师父亲自给他剃度的

01:07:13,989 --> 01:07:17,868
you may be unaware of his background.
您老人家对他的身世也许不清楚

502
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:30,672
But let's not dwell on that.
先不管这些

503
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:35,343
If he'd reformed, I'd let it go.
他要是能痛改前非  也就罢了

504
01:07:36,011 --> 01:07:37,929
But he's up to his old tricks!

He was stealing in the Scripture Hall.

Luckily, Chang Cheng was on hand to stop him.

It's a lie!

01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:05,100
Your Reverence...

I have reported the incident to the Abbot.

512
01:08:12,714 --> 01:08:15,592
May I question Lieutenant Chang?
我可不可以问张指挥几句话

513
01:08:16,343 --> 01:08:17,427
Of course.
请

514
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:20,889
Lieutenant Chang.
张指挥

515
01:08:21,223 --> 01:08:24,101
How do you know he was stealing?

516
01:08:25,519 --> 01:08:26,645
As it happens,
是这样的

I saw him sneak into the Scripture Hall.

When I asked him what he was doing,
我问他到这儿来干什么

520
01:08:34,152 --> 01:08:36,321
he couldn't give me a straight answer.
他支支吾吾的答不出来

521
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:39,533
Then I knew he was up to something.
我马上就猜到了  他图谋不轨

522
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:44,079
You guessed, Lieutenant?
张指挥是猜到的

523
01:08:47,207 --> 01:08:48,583
Lt. Chang is an officer of the law.
张指挥是提刑出身

524
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:50,168
He's familiar with the likes of Chiu Ming.
对这类人最清楚了

525
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:56,091
Wasn't Lt. Chang himself an outlaw
听说张指挥在投效朝廷之前

526
01:08:56,216 --> 01:08:58,760
before he joined the constabulary?
也在江湖上混过

527
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:01,805
Let's not digress.
先不要谈这些题外的话

528
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:05,600
Chiu Ming was stealing
邱明由藏经楼偷了东西出来

529
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,894

530
01:09:08,019 --> 01:09:09,938
In shame and anger,

01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:11,857
he threw Lt. Chang from the Scripture Hall!
还把张诚从楼上打了下来

532
01:09:12,107 --> 01:09:14,276
Chiu Ming! Is it true?
邱明  有没有这回事

533
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:16,570
Yes.
有

534
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:21,658
General Wang,
王将军

535
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:25,787
I've heard that Lt. Chang is a martial artist.
听说张指挥的武功造诣很高啊

536
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:27,622
Indeed he is!
相当不错

537
01:09:28,707 --> 01:09:32,377
Then how is it that he was thrown down the stairs?
那怎么会让他从楼上打下来呢

538
01:09:33,003 --> 01:09:35,755
No, no, no! This is a sacred place!
不不不不  这里是佛门净地

539
01:09:35,881 --> 01:09:38,216
I would never violate its sanctity by fighting.
我怎么能够跟他动武呢

540
01:09:44,264 --> 01:09:49,060
Lt. Chang would've arrested him anywhere else.
要是在外边儿  张诚立刻就抓他归案

541
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,566
But the temple
可是  现在是在庙里

542
01:09:55,192 --> 01:09:57,027
is under the Abbot's jurisdiction.
就请老禅师处理吧

543
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,900
Hui Tung,
慧通

544
01:10:03,550 --> 01:10:05,950
what do you think should be done?
你看应该怎么办

545
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:07,996
According to the rules,
依照庙规

546
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:11,666
he should be expelled for thievery.

548
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:18,715
and should be remanded to General Wang.
按照国法  应该把他交王将军处置

549
01:10:23,887 --> 01:10:26,181
Hui Wen, what do you think?
慧文  你说说看

550
01:10:31,228 --> 01:10:33,480
The Scripture Hall has long been my responsibility.
藏经楼一直是由弟子管

551
01:10:34,314 --> 01:10:38,652
If Chiu Ming trespassed there,
邱明居然能进去  这是弟子失职

552
01:10:38,777 --> 01:10:40,570
I am at fault.
弟子应该负责

553
01:10:41,071 --> 01:10:44,074
But I don't understand how it was
不过  弟子不明白

554
01:10:44,658 --> 01:10:47,118
that Lieutenant Chang happened to be there.
张指挥到藏经楼去干什么

555
01:10:50,372 --> 01:10:52,040
Leave that aside for now.
不要说这些了

556
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:55,252
And you, Hui Ssu?
慧思  你说说

557
01:10:55,377 --> 01:10:56,453
Punish him!
要重罚

558
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:08,390
May I ask why?
请问三师傅  什么理由呢

559
01:11:09,474 --> 01:11:12,560
Because that's the only way to satisfy General Wang.
不重罚  王将军和张指挥的气难消

560
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,528
Bind Chiu Ming to the Scripture Hall.
把邱明吊在藏经楼上

561
01:11:29,244 --> 01:11:32,789
General, I fear the Abbot
将军  你这招恶人先告状

562
01:11:32,914 --> 01:11:34,916
is onto your scheme.
智严老住持看穿了

563
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:37,711
He's a senile old man in his 90s, he won't see through it.
他九十多岁了  糊里糊涂的看不穿

564
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:39,671
He's not senile in the least.
他一点儿也不糊涂

565
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:42,799
And Wu Wai is suspicious too.
还有  悟外的话多厉害

566
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:46,720
It isn't looking good.
这事有点不妙

567
01:11:47,304 --> 01:11:50,265
Only you and Chiu Ming know what happened.
这件事  只有你和邱明知道

568
01:11:51,141 --> 01:11:53,059
He's tied to the Scripture Hall.
他现在绑在藏经楼上

569
01:11:55,854 --> 01:11:58,064
Wait a bit, then go and finish him off.
等会儿你去把他一了百了

570
01:12:14,164 --> 01:12:15,240
Jump!
跳下去

571
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:27,260
Why are you freeing me?
施主  为什么放我下来

572
01:12:27,469 --> 01:12:28,720
By order of Esquire Wen -
是文安让我放你的

573
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:30,263
he wants to befriend you.
他想跟你结个善缘

574
01:12:30,388 --> 01:12:33,016
Isn't this in defiance of the Abbot's orders?
这样会不会违背师父的原意

575
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:36,436
Not at all.
不会

576
01:12:40,065 --> 01:12:41,074
It won't work.
不妥当

577
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:43,434
Why not?
怎么

578
01:12:47,072 --> 01:12:52,577
Killing Chiu Ming would be of no avail.
把邱明除了  于事无补啊

579
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:58,041
A murder while we were here
再说  庙里出了人命

580
01:12:58,166 --> 01:13:01,753
would reflect badly on us.
有你我在场  传出去不好听呐

581
01:13:04,464 --> 01:13:06,591
We came for the scroll,
咱们是为了那个卷子来的

582
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:08,510
let's not complicate matters.
不能节外生枝

583
01:13:08,968 --> 01:13:10,003
You're right.
也对

584
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:12,322
Forget it.
那就算了

585
01:13:14,182 --> 01:13:16,810
General, go to the Abbot immediately
将军  你要立刻到老禅师那里

586
01:13:16,935 --> 01:13:19,479
and ask him to release Chiu Ming.
替邱明讲情  把他放下来

587
01:13:21,356 --> 01:13:23,441
You'll make a good impression.
这样可以结个善缘

588
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,902
I can't go back on what I said earlier.
我出尔反尔  这怎么行呢

589
01:13:27,237 --> 01:13:28,363
You can!
行

590
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:32,033
Your Reverence,
难道让我说

591
01:13:32,367 --> 01:13:34,702
yesterday my anger blinded me.
老禅师  我昨天是在气头上

592
01:13:34,828 --> 01:13:37,163
I didn't think Chiu Ming would be treated so harshly.
没想到使邱明受这么重的惩罚

593
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:39,666
Now I regret it. Can you pardon him?
我有点儿后悔了  你饶了他吧

594
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:43,169
General, he deserves his punishment.
将军  他是罪有应得

595
01:13:47,215 --> 01:13:48,758
He's been there for hours.
已经吊了几个时辰了

596
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:50,301
Surely he's suffered enough.
也够他受的了

597
01:13:50,677 --> 01:13:53,847
Can't he be released now?
不如  现在把他放下来吧

598
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:04,190
It's getting late. Perhaps the General should rest.
时候不早了  将军也该休息了

599
01:14:05,692 --> 01:14:07,861
We'll discuss this another time.
好好  再说吧

600
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:10,238
See the General out.
你送送将军

601
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:11,573
Yes.
是

602
01:14:15,285 --> 01:14:16,327
Goodnight.
我不打搅了

603
01:14:16,453 --> 01:14:17,470
General...
将军

604
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:18,500
Yes?
什么事

605
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,730
Tomorrow the monks will be tested
从明天起  庙里的和尚论经证道

606
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:23,543
and a new abbot will be chosen.
然后推举新住持

607
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:26,296
Please be there to advise us.
到时候  想请将军光临指导

608
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:30,467
Certainly.
我一定来

609

Gentleman, have you studied
他们三个人的答卷

610
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:40,662
the three disciples' answers?
二位都看过了吧

Approach!
过来

616
01:16:00,807 --> 01:16:04,602
Of all the temple's monks, you three
这几天看下来  庙里几百位弟子

617
01:16:04,727 --> 01:16:09,440
have the best knowledge of Buddhism.
你们三个人论经证道成就最高

618
01:16:09,566 --> 01:16:11,943
Each of you is worthy of the abbot ship.
都能主持本寺的大局

619
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:15,029
Now His Reverence must make a decision.
现在  请老禅师定夺

620

The three of you go to the pond behind the temple

621
01:16:21,619 --> 01:16:23,913
and each fetch a bucket of clear water.

你这清水是怎么打的

627
01:17:04,037 --> 01:17:06,122
Only by working with my brothers
弟子和师弟们同心合力

628
01:17:06,247 --> 01:17:07,915
was I able to obtain clear water.
才打到一桶清水

629
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:11,127
Explain your answer.
你解给我听

630
01:17:11,836 --> 01:17:13,421
Only when the many streams

Madame!

On my own I'm no match for him.

Don't worry. I've got your back.
