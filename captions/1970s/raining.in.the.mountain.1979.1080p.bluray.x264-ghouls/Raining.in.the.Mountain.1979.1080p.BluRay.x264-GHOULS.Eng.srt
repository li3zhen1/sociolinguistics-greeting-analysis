Three Treasures Temple
is just beyond that shrine.

19
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,589
See that senior monk?

20
00:04:58,424 --> 00:04:59,967
He's the temple guardian.

21
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:01,927
As long as he's on duty,

22
00:05:02,052 --> 00:05:04,513
outsiders dare not set foot here.

23
00:05:20,029 --> 00:05:21,030
Brother.

24
00:05:21,238 --> 00:05:24,533
Please follow me.

25
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:56,857
Who is he?

26
00:05:57,816 --> 00:05:58,776
Brother Hui Ssu.

27
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:03,405
Brother Hui Ssu.

28
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,698
Welcome!

29
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:05,824
This is my concubine.

30
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:07,159
Madame.

31
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,786
Esquire Wen,

32
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:11,580
the Abbot sent me to welcome you.

33
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:12,748
Thank you!

34
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:15,959
When I received the Abbot's letter

35
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:17,544
I rushed right over.

36
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,546
How is the old master?

37
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:21,840
Not well.

38
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:24,718
He had a fainting spell two days ago,

39
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:26,762
but he's a little better today.

40
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,723
I'm afraid his time is not long.

41
00:06:51,036 --> 00:06:53,330
This is the famous Three Treasures Temple.

42
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:00,796
What are the "three treasures"?

43
00:07:03,549 --> 00:07:06,427
Not worldly but spiritual treasures:

44
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:09,388
the Buddha, the Dharma
and the monastic community.

45
00:07:09,513 --> 00:07:10,681
I don't understand.

46
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,142
Do you mean Tripitaka's...?

47
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:16,937
The Mahayana Sutra in Tripitaka's own hand.

48
00:07:17,604 --> 00:07:18,897
How much is it worth?

49
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:22,943
It's priceless.

50
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:26,280
I've brought aged ginseng
from the north.

51
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:28,115
Perhaps it can help the Abbot.

52
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,491
Many thanks!

53
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:32,411
The Abbot told me to inform you

54
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:34,496
that before he dies,

55
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,331
he must name a successor.

56
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:38,625
Because we've so many worthy monks,

57
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:41,462
he's asked lay friends to assist him.

58
00:07:41,587 --> 00:07:43,672
Who else has he invited?

59
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:46,049
I don't know.

60
00:07:53,015 --> 00:07:55,767
The Abbot also thanks you

61
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,978
for all the donations

62
00:07:58,103 --> 00:07:59,605
you've given us over the years

63
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:01,190
and your warm support.

64
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:03,233
Don't mention it.

65
00:08:25,506 --> 00:08:26,882
The Abbot has another request.

66
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:32,012
- Does the temple need more...?
- No, we're financially sound.

67
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,181
He asks you

68
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:37,893
to lend your support to the new abbot.

69
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,186
But of course.

70
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:47,027
Brother Hui Ssu.

71
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:50,239
Who do you expect him to choose?

72
00:08:52,157 --> 00:08:55,619
It's not for me to speculate.

73
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,715
- Let them take your luggage.
- Yes, sir!

74
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,467
- Take the valet to his room.
- Yes, sir!

75
00:10:45,729 --> 00:10:46,813
This way.

76
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,366
Your meal will be served shortly.

77
00:10:57,491 --> 00:10:59,660
Thank you. You're dismissed.

78
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,018
Let's eat.

79
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:09,438
Go ahead. I'll just be a minute.

80
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:25,532
Hurry!

81
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:28,697
Up there!

82
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,591
There it is!

83
00:16:54,806 --> 00:16:55,682
Come on!

84
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:07,337
Hurry!

85
00:18:39,202 --> 00:18:40,702
( No Admittance )

86
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:53,508
It must be here somewhere. Keep watch!

87
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:54,342
OK.

88
00:22:09,495 --> 00:22:09,996
Find it?

89
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:11,247
No!

90
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:13,374
What does it look like?

91
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:14,876
It's a long scroll.

92
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:17,295
Wait...

93
00:22:23,509 --> 00:22:24,802
The door's unlocked.

94
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:25,636
Unlocked?

95
00:22:25,762 --> 00:22:27,597
It can't be. Let's take a look.

96
00:23:01,214 --> 00:23:02,048
Look!

97
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:04,717
It's open! Hurry, tell Brother Hui Wen.

98
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:14,227
Brother Hui Wen!

99
00:23:15,812 --> 00:23:16,479
What is it?

100
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:18,564
The Scripture Hall door is unlocked.

101
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:20,066
Yes, I opened it.

102
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:22,026
Then left it unlocked?

103
00:23:27,573 --> 00:23:28,282
What'd he say?

104
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:29,784
He said to leave it open.

105
00:24:25,381 --> 00:24:26,382
This way.

106
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:48,029
Was it a trying journey?

107
00:24:48,154 --> 00:24:48,905
Not so bad.

108
00:25:04,879 --> 00:25:06,005
Good day.

109
00:25:20,978 --> 00:25:22,188
Take the luggage to the guest rooms.

110
00:25:30,488 --> 00:25:31,197
Madame!

111
00:25:33,908 --> 00:25:34,909
Over there!

112
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:45,670
What is it?

113
00:25:46,712 --> 00:25:47,755
Strange!

114
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,885
Brother Hui Tung, who is that?

115
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:54,554
Esquire Wen's new concubine.

116
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:55,429
Esquire Wen?

117
00:25:55,555 --> 00:25:57,723
The wealthy landowner from Chiang Tung?

118
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,141
I know him.

119
00:26:02,395 --> 00:26:03,563
Unbelievable!

120
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:05,398
You know the woman?

121
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:06,649
Yes.

122
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:08,776
Who is she?

123
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:10,570
She's called White Fox.
A thief.

124
00:26:10,695 --> 00:26:12,738
A thief? Are you sure?

125
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:27,587
It's her.

126
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:30,131
Did you see it, General?

127
00:26:30,256 --> 00:26:32,091
She has a master key.

128
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,303
Oh? I didn't notice.

129
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:45,146
I arrested her once in the north,

130
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,897
but she escaped.

131
00:26:48,608 --> 00:26:50,818
I don't know Esquire Wen very well,

132
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,695
but I should inform him

133
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,447
that he has married a thief.

134
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,325
Brother Hui Tung,
please arrange a meeting.

135
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,200
Very well!

136
00:26:58,743 --> 00:26:59,910
General, wait!

137
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,120
What is it?

138
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:04,915
There's more to this
than meets the eye.

139
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:09,545
You were too careless.

140
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:10,838
You brought me here

141
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,632
to steal that damn scroll for you.

142
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:14,300
So what was I supposed to do?

143
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:16,385
Wait for the right time!

144
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:20,264
This temple food is awful!

145
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:23,976
Everyone here eats the same food.

146
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:26,270
Those leading spiritual lives
for ego luxuries.

147
00:27:27,188 --> 00:27:28,105
I'm not leading a spiritual life!

148
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:30,024
Given your history,

149
00:27:30,149 --> 00:27:31,609
perhaps you should!

150
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:32,860
Nonsense!

151
00:27:33,819 --> 00:27:34,820
I don't understand...

152
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:37,448
With your wealth you can buy anything.

153
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,158
What do you want with
a ragged old scroll?

154
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:42,828
What do you know?

155
00:27:46,457 --> 00:27:48,542
It's the Mahayana Sutra,

156
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:51,295
hand-copied by the great monk Tripitaka.

157
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:52,922
It's priceless.

158
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,424
Money can't buy it.

159
00:27:55,925 --> 00:27:57,093
What good is it?

160
00:28:01,347 --> 00:28:04,767
It's one of a kind.

161
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:07,978
I've long dreamed of possessing it.

162
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:12,316
I'll get it for you
as soon as I can

163
00:28:12,483 --> 00:28:14,110
and then get the hell out of here.

164
00:28:14,402 --> 00:28:15,569
I'm telling you,

165
00:28:15,695 --> 00:28:17,029
I don't want to hang around this dump!

166
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:21,742
Don't be rash. I've got a plan.

167
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:23,327
Forget it! I'm getting out of here!

168
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,247
I'll give you your money back.

169
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:28,332
Hire someone else. I quit.

170
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:32,128
Why are you so angry?

171
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,797
I don't like waiting around!

172
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:35,923
OK, OK!

173
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:37,675
Hey! Keep your hands off!

174
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,844
You paid me to steal the scroll

175
00:28:39,969 --> 00:28:40,720
and that's all you'll get!

176
00:28:44,265 --> 00:28:46,392
So now you're a lady of virtue, eh?

177
00:28:46,642 --> 00:28:47,601
Shut up!

178
00:28:47,727 --> 00:28:49,145
We had an understanding, didn't we?

179
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:50,771
I sell my skills, not my body!

180
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,398
I'm not a whore!

181
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,109
Keep it down, will you?

182
00:28:55,234 --> 00:28:56,902
- Why should I?
- Please, my lady.

183
00:29:05,995 --> 00:29:06,871
Who is it?

184
00:29:06,996 --> 00:29:08,247
It's me.

185
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:13,127
Brother Hui Wen.

186
00:29:13,252 --> 00:29:14,336
Greetings.

187
00:29:18,841 --> 00:29:21,218
Come, I'll introduce you.

188
00:29:30,895 --> 00:29:32,146
This is Brother Hui Wen.

189
00:29:33,856 --> 00:29:37,151
We've already met...
at the Scripture Hall.

190
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:40,654
Fortunately, he's our friend.

191
00:29:40,863 --> 00:29:43,491
He's the Abbot's number two disciple

192
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:46,160
and will very likely be the next abbot.

193
00:29:47,787 --> 00:29:49,163
We can't be certain of that!

194
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:51,457
Don't worry.

195
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:55,669
My words carry weight with the Abbot.

196
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:59,507
I'll leave you two to your business.

197
00:29:59,965 --> 00:30:00,883
Fine.

198
00:30:01,801 --> 00:30:04,720
Your support is invaluable.

199
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:07,264
Did you get my letter?

200
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:09,183
Yes.

201
00:30:09,934 --> 00:30:13,896
I can almost guarantee you
the position.

202
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:16,816
Did you receive my letter?

203
00:30:16,941 --> 00:30:18,108
Yes.

204
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:21,821
If I become the new abbot,

205
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:24,490
the scroll is yours!

206
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:27,326
Then it's a deal!

207
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:29,870
We businessmen place trust above all.

208
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,372
I'll speak to the Abbot in a bit.

209
00:30:31,497 --> 00:30:32,873
I'll sound him out for you.

210
00:30:33,707 --> 00:30:35,668
Please, don't be hasty.

211
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:38,420
General Wang is pressing Hui Tung's case!

212
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:40,381
Wang's a soldier, not a scholar.

213
00:30:40,506 --> 00:30:42,633
The Abbot won't necessarily
heed his counsel.

214
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:44,677
Let's hope not.

215
00:30:45,678 --> 00:30:46,595
I must be going.

216
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,763
OK.

217
00:30:51,141 --> 00:30:52,142
One more thing:

218
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:57,523
your concubine may move freely about,

219
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,775
but she mustn't arouse suspicion.

220
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,318
Understood.

221
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,201
Someone's outside.

222
00:32:22,942 --> 00:32:23,943
Gold Lock!

223
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:25,903
Over here!

224
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:31,951
Let him go.

225
00:32:32,076 --> 00:32:33,077
Yes.

226
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,948
Who is he?

227
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:56,035
He's the famous Master Wu Wai.

228
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:08,213
What is he known for?

229
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:09,757
He's a devoted lay Buddhist.

230
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:10,841
I don't get it.

231
00:34:10,966 --> 00:34:13,260
Although he's a layman, he knows

232
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:15,637
the sutras better than most monks do!

233
00:34:27,232 --> 00:34:29,902
Then what's he doing with all those women?

234
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,905
He's immune to sensual pleasures.

235
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:36,325
Him? He looks like an old lecher.

236
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:40,079
Nonsense!
Even the emperor defers to him.

237
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:57,262
Halt!

238
00:35:56,196 --> 00:35:57,823
It's so good you've come!

239
00:35:57,948 --> 00:35:59,074
Your Reverence!

240
00:36:00,617 --> 00:36:02,744
Arise, arise!

241
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:28,395
Get up!

242
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:44,745
Esquire Wen.

243
00:36:46,747 --> 00:36:48,916
General Wang, it's been a while.

244
00:36:49,041 --> 00:36:50,792
Over a year since we last met.

245
00:36:59,426 --> 00:37:03,430
Master Wu Wai travels in style, doesn't he?

246
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:12,856
I believe he too has come here

247
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:15,275
for the succession.

248
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:16,944
Perhaps.

249
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:20,906
Who do you think will be chosen?

250
00:37:22,074 --> 00:37:23,367
Who do you think?

251
00:37:24,701 --> 00:37:28,872
Brother Hui Tung, without a doubt.

252
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:35,045
Brother Hui Tung is very clever.

253
00:37:58,402 --> 00:37:59,278
Over here.

254
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:01,113
Give it to me.

255
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:02,322
This food is for Master Wu Wai.

256
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,032
I know. Now give it to me!

257
00:38:07,035 --> 00:38:08,120
Go on!

258
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:13,417
Who will Your Reverence pick?

259
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:16,545
My mind is unsteady these days

260
00:38:16,795 --> 00:38:19,673
and my old body is failing me.

261
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:23,969
That is why I seek your advice.

262
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,856
The temple is a huge responsibility.

263
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:38,567
If I choose unwisely,

264
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:41,320
disputes will arise.

265
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:44,656
General Wang and Esquire Wen
have also come.

266
00:38:44,781 --> 00:38:46,867
If there is a disagreement,

267
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:49,995
they can arbitrate.

268
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:54,333
What are your criteria
for choosing the new abbot?

269
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:55,876
I have none.

270
00:38:56,543 --> 00:38:59,212
It doesn't matter...

271
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:04,718
...whether he is a monk or a layman,

272
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:08,221
so long as he is enlightened.

273
00:39:13,685 --> 00:39:14,519
Hui Ssu,

274
00:39:15,187 --> 00:39:18,190
go and fetch Master Wu Wai's meal.

275
00:39:18,315 --> 00:39:19,274
Will do.

276
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:27,532
Brother Hui Tung.

277
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:32,245
I'm delivering Master Wu Wai's meal.

278
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:36,208
I'll take it.
You prepare a pot of tea.

279
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:40,796
OK.

280
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,858
Your Reverence, when are you planning
to choose a successor?

281
00:40:02,401 --> 00:40:03,443
In a few days.

282
00:40:03,568 --> 00:40:06,279
But there's a worldly matter
to attend to first.

283
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:10,826
A convict has purchased a permit
to become a monk here.

284
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:23,422
Let's take a rest.

285
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,734
Nobody's around. I'll take it off.

286
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:55,287
Thank you, officer!

287
00:40:55,537 --> 00:40:56,705
Not at all.

288
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:59,458
We've been through a lot together.

289
00:41:03,795 --> 00:41:04,921
Is this Chiu Ming?

290
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:05,505
Yes.

291
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,215
Here's the document you need.

292
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:12,053
May I see the Abbot?

293
00:41:12,179 --> 00:41:14,764
The Abbot sent me
to take charge of him.

294
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:20,103
Make good use
of your time here, friend.

295
00:41:20,604 --> 00:41:21,646
Perhaps we'll meet again.

296
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:24,065
Officer!

297
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:28,111
I don't know how to thank you!

298
00:41:29,404 --> 00:41:31,448
Please don't.
Get up!

299
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:43,877
Kneel.

300
00:41:52,344 --> 00:41:55,180
This is the Abbot
and this is Master Wu Wai.

301
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:00,310
I bow to you, Reverence.

302
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:07,108
Who is your master?

303
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,610
You are my master.

304
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:23,500
Do you sincerely wish to become a monk?

305
00:42:23,667 --> 00:42:24,751
I do.

306
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:27,379
You are a convicted criminal.

307
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:29,089
What are you charged with?

308
00:42:29,881 --> 00:42:30,674
Theft.

309
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:34,386
So you did transgress.

310
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:40,225
No. I was falsely accused.

311
00:42:40,350 --> 00:42:41,601
By whom?

312
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:43,103
Lieutenant Chang Cheng.

313
00:42:45,564 --> 00:42:47,691
How did that happen?

314
00:42:47,899 --> 00:42:49,609
My brother was a woodblock printer.

315
00:42:49,734 --> 00:42:52,696
Our family owned a rare edition
of the Diamond Sutra.

316
00:42:52,821 --> 00:42:54,072
Chang Cheng wanted to buy it.

317
00:42:54,197 --> 00:42:55,615
My brother wouldn't sell it.

318
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:58,577
So Chang Cheng accused us of theft.

319
00:43:02,414 --> 00:43:03,498
Arise.

320
00:43:14,009 --> 00:43:15,176
And then?

321
00:43:15,677 --> 00:43:18,013
He beat my brother to death in court

322
00:43:18,513 --> 00:43:20,056
and I was sentenced
to serve in the army.

323
00:43:20,348 --> 00:43:21,766
Have you ever met Chang Cheng?

324
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:22,976
No.

325
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:34,362
If you happened to meet him,
what would you do?

326
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,323
Nothing.

327
00:43:37,449 --> 00:43:39,034
You bear no grudge?

328
00:43:45,874 --> 00:43:48,918
Start by mopping the temple floor.

329
00:44:08,313 --> 00:44:09,731
Go and get the goods.

330
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,069
Hurry! Give it over!

331
00:44:14,194 --> 00:44:16,154
Calm down.

332
00:44:21,284 --> 00:44:22,285
Be careful!

333
00:44:25,288 --> 00:44:26,331
Hey! Where's the money?

334
00:44:35,256 --> 00:44:36,299
- Not enough!
- It's plenty.

335
00:44:39,469 --> 00:44:41,971
I'm taking a loss...

336
00:44:52,774 --> 00:44:54,067
Seven strings of 100...

337
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:55,527
Six strings of 320...

338
00:44:55,652 --> 00:44:57,153
Six strings of 910...

339
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:58,905
Seven strings of 460...

340
00:45:11,584 --> 00:45:12,961
Four strings of 650.

341
00:45:13,712 --> 00:45:14,921
Stop!

342
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:27,434
Wrong again!

343
00:45:28,017 --> 00:45:30,145
You! Do it over!

344
00:47:48,283 --> 00:47:49,242
Esquire Wen.

345
00:47:49,826 --> 00:47:50,869
General Wang.

346
00:48:05,008 --> 00:48:08,219
I just saw something strange.

347
00:48:13,766 --> 00:48:16,019
While Wu Wai was preaching,
his attendants

348
00:48:16,144 --> 00:48:19,564
were bathing in full view
of the monks!

349
00:48:20,106 --> 00:48:21,024
Where?

350
00:48:21,149 --> 00:48:22,442
Just over the hill.

351
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,195
This way of propagating Buddhism

352
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:27,989
is really something new.

353
00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:30,366
Going a bit far,
wouldn't you say?

354
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:31,910
Very profound.

355
00:48:33,036 --> 00:48:34,954
I think I'll have a look.

356
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:39,792
They're still there.
Follow me.

357
00:48:39,918 --> 00:48:40,919
OK.

358
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:43,421
Please.

359
00:48:44,631 --> 00:48:45,840
What sect is it?

360
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:47,258
No idea...

361
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:50,345
Gentlemen, the Abbot...

362
00:48:53,473 --> 00:48:54,557
will see you now.

363
00:48:57,727 --> 00:48:59,896
Very well.

364
00:49:01,481 --> 00:49:02,690
This way.

365
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,027
- Please.
- Please.

366
00:49:11,658 --> 00:49:12,659
Please follow me.

367
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:24,879
Please.

368
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:46,234
- Gentlemen.
- Your Reverence.

369
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:54,450
The Abbot had matters to attend to

370
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:57,203
and couldn't see you earlier.
Apologies.

371
00:49:57,704 --> 00:50:01,165
He hopes you're comfortable here.

372
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:03,543
Very much so!

373
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:10,425
The Abbot says,
when his successor takes over,

374
00:50:10,550 --> 00:50:12,051
if there's a dispute,

375
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:13,970
he'd like you two to mediate.

376
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:15,722
Rest assured, Reverence.

377
00:50:16,014 --> 00:50:17,348
We'll do as you wish.

378
00:50:17,473 --> 00:50:18,641
Very well.

379
00:50:19,267 --> 00:50:20,685
Your Reverence,

380
00:50:20,810 --> 00:50:22,895
which of the monks

381
00:50:23,021 --> 00:50:24,230
will you choose as your successor?

382
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:29,318
Each of them is worthy,

383
00:50:30,278 --> 00:50:35,116
each is perfect in his own way.

384
00:50:42,415 --> 00:50:46,252
You two have done much for me
over the years.

385
00:50:46,753 --> 00:50:50,298
How can I repay you?

386
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:57,805
I've heard Tripitaka's handwritten
Mahayana Sutra is kept here.

387
00:50:57,972 --> 00:51:00,516
Would it be possible to see it?

388
00:51:00,725 --> 00:51:02,060
By all means.

389
00:51:02,685 --> 00:51:04,395
Is Esquire Wen also interested?

390
00:51:04,729 --> 00:51:07,356
I've long yearned to see
the treasured scroll.

391
00:51:10,026 --> 00:51:11,486
Ha! It's no treasure,

392
00:51:11,611 --> 00:51:13,780
just a roll of tattered paper.

393
00:51:25,541 --> 00:51:27,418
It truly is a priceless treasure.

394
00:51:27,794 --> 00:51:29,587
Incomparable!

395
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:39,097
Its true value lies in its meaning.

396
00:51:39,222 --> 00:51:40,056
But of course!

397
00:51:40,181 --> 00:51:41,933
Brother Hui Ssu, lead the way.

398
00:52:56,299 --> 00:52:56,924
Let's go!

399
00:54:39,527 --> 00:54:40,653
- Hey, what's that?
- Indeed.

400
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:42,530
- Let's go and check it out.
- Sure.

401
00:54:42,655 --> 00:54:43,906
Wait a second.

402
00:54:44,073 --> 00:54:45,074
What is it?

403
00:54:45,283 --> 00:54:47,451
- Let's take a look.
- At what?

404
00:54:48,953 --> 00:54:50,329
The ground's covered with them...

405
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:51,789
Careful!

406
00:54:52,873 --> 00:54:54,041
They look like prayer beads.

407
00:54:54,625 --> 00:54:55,626
They're unstrung!

408
00:54:56,836 --> 00:54:57,128
Hurry!

409
00:54:57,253 --> 00:54:59,630
Come on, pick them up!

410
00:55:07,305 --> 00:55:08,889
Give them to him.

411
00:55:11,809 --> 00:55:12,810
Here's one...

412
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:15,980
- Keep looking.
- OK.

413
00:55:16,772 --> 00:55:17,857
There's more here.

414
00:55:18,566 --> 00:55:20,192
Go and look by the back door.

415
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:26,991
- Are there some more?
- No.

416
00:55:30,911 --> 00:55:32,538
- There are some here.
- Gather them.

417
00:55:34,623 --> 00:55:36,542
- They're gone.
- Go look.

418
00:55:43,215 --> 00:55:43,966
Any more?

419
00:55:46,469 --> 00:55:47,553
Here's one more!

420
00:55:48,054 --> 00:55:50,973
You! Who are you?

421
00:55:55,269 --> 00:55:55,978
Chiu Ming.

422
00:55:56,604 --> 00:55:57,730
Chiu Ming?

423
00:56:00,816 --> 00:56:02,568
Chiu Ming?

424
00:56:08,866 --> 00:56:10,076
What did you do
before you came here?

425
00:56:10,242 --> 00:56:11,786
I was sentenced
to serve in the army

426
00:56:12,370 --> 00:56:15,831
but I bought a permit
to become a monk instead.

427
00:56:16,749 --> 00:56:18,250
Since you're a monk now,

428
00:56:18,376 --> 00:56:19,877
what are you doing with these women?

429
00:56:26,592 --> 00:56:29,303
Watch what you say, sir.

430
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:30,429
Outrageous!

431
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:32,890
You dare lecture me?

432
00:57:02,837 --> 00:57:04,630
This is preposterous!

433
00:57:30,114 --> 00:57:31,782
Let's go! Don't be nosy.

434
00:57:31,907 --> 00:57:33,909
Hurry! Go!

435
00:57:57,141 --> 00:57:57,683
What are you doing?

436
00:57:57,808 --> 00:57:58,767
The hook!

437
00:58:37,223 --> 00:58:39,016
All for a raggedy scroll...

438
00:58:43,896 --> 00:58:44,855
Sit.

439
00:58:57,284 --> 00:59:00,955
Chiu Ming, tell no one about this,

440
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:03,290
or it will be trouble for you.

441
00:59:03,582 --> 00:59:04,708
Understood.

442
00:59:05,125 --> 00:59:08,087
The man who struck you
was Chang Cheng.

443
00:59:10,548 --> 00:59:11,924
Don't be afraid.

444
00:59:25,437 --> 00:59:26,355
Kneel.

445
00:59:31,986 --> 00:59:34,738
Henceforth, you shall guard
the Scripture Hall.

446
00:59:34,863 --> 00:59:39,201
The responsibility
is too great for me.

447
00:59:39,326 --> 00:59:40,578
Why is that?

448
00:59:41,453 --> 00:59:42,454
I've heard Tripitaka's handwritten

449
00:59:42,580 --> 00:59:45,624
Mahayana Sutra is kept there.

450
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:47,501
If something should happen to it...

451
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:49,753
That is a worldly view.

452
00:59:49,878 --> 00:59:52,381
The old scroll has no real value.

453
01:00:27,583 --> 01:00:28,417
Brother.

454
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:34,131
Take this ginseng to Master Wu Wai.

455
01:00:34,256 --> 01:00:35,507
Tell him it's a gift from Esquire Wen.

456
01:00:35,633 --> 01:00:36,634
Yes.

457
01:00:40,054 --> 01:00:41,847
Brother Hui Ssu,

458
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:43,515
I'd like a word with you.

459
01:00:51,357 --> 01:00:52,608
When did he take the vows?

460
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,401
This morning.

461
01:00:55,277 --> 01:00:56,820
Why were you two
in the Scripture Hall?

462
01:00:57,112 --> 01:00:59,448
The Abbot appointed him
guardian of the Scripture Hall.

463
01:01:04,703 --> 01:01:07,164
A convict guarding the scriptures...

464
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:09,500
What's the deeper meaning of this?

465
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:12,920
Perhaps Master will choose Hui Ssu.

466
01:01:13,671 --> 01:01:15,130
No, he won't!

467
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:29,395
Hui Ssu is too young.

468
01:01:30,062 --> 01:01:32,690
You've managed the temple's assets
for many years.

469
01:01:32,815 --> 01:01:36,652
No one is better suited than you.

470
01:01:37,945 --> 01:01:39,238
Please don't say that!

471
01:01:39,363 --> 01:01:41,073
If Hui Tung should overhear,

472
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:42,491
there'd be no end of trouble.

473
01:01:43,659 --> 01:01:45,202
You're both talking rubbish!

474
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:49,415
Don't be foolhardy!

475
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:52,042
My way is better.

476
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:54,420
Listen... wait...!

477
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,888
Sir!

478
01:02:51,518 --> 01:02:52,394
Sir!

479
01:02:53,896 --> 01:02:54,938
Sir!

480
01:03:14,041 --> 01:03:16,627
Sir, wait!

481
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:03,543
Let us begin.

482
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:07,839
Your Reverence!

483
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:17,933
I am your devoted lay friend,

484
01:06:20,227 --> 01:06:22,145
but I'm also governor
of this district.

485
01:06:24,022 --> 01:06:26,775
There is a matter
we must get to the bottom of.

486
01:06:27,192 --> 01:06:29,152
Feel free to speak.

487
01:06:35,534 --> 01:06:36,618
Are you aware

488
01:06:36,743 --> 01:06:38,328
of this man's background?

489
01:06:38,620 --> 01:06:40,163
Please go on.

490
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:46,003
He's a criminal.

491
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:49,715
A thief!

492
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:52,217
He was arrested
and sentenced to the army.

493
01:06:54,886 --> 01:06:56,346
I don't know how he
got the money

494
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:57,931
to buy his way out.

495
01:06:58,056 --> 01:07:00,017
His Reverence is aware of this.

496
01:07:00,267 --> 01:07:02,477
It was the Abbot himself
who administered the vows.

497
01:07:05,147 --> 01:07:08,150
Your Reverence has led a spiritual life,

498
01:07:08,275 --> 01:07:09,860
indifferent to worldly affairs.

499
01:07:10,527 --> 01:07:12,029
Do you question my judgment?

500
01:07:12,237 --> 01:07:13,864
No, no! All I'm saying is

501
01:07:13,989 --> 01:07:17,868
you may be unaware of his background.

502
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:30,672
But let's not dwell on that.

503
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:35,343
If he'd reformed, I'd let it go.

504
01:07:36,011 --> 01:07:37,929
But he's up to his old tricks!

505
01:07:39,598 --> 01:07:42,142
Oh? How has he erred?

506
01:07:44,895 --> 01:07:49,399
He was stealing in the Scripture Hall.

507
01:07:55,363 --> 01:07:59,242
Luckily, Chang Cheng
was on hand to stop him.

508
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:00,619
It's a lie!

509
01:08:04,206 --> 01:08:05,123
Your Reverence...

510
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:09,628
I have reported the incident to the Abbot.

511
01:08:11,296 --> 01:08:12,380
General Wang.

512
01:08:12,714 --> 01:08:15,592
May I question Lieutenant Chang?

513
01:08:16,343 --> 01:08:17,427
Of course.

514
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:20,889
Lieutenant Chang.

515
01:08:21,223 --> 01:08:24,101
How do you know he was stealing?

516
01:08:25,519 --> 01:08:26,645
As it happens,

517
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:29,689
I saw him sneak into the Scripture Hall.

518
01:08:29,898 --> 01:08:31,900
I grew suspicious and followed him.

519
01:08:32,359 --> 01:08:34,027
When I asked him what he was doing,

520
01:08:34,152 --> 01:08:36,321
he couldn't give me a straight answer.

521
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:39,533
Then I knew
he was up to something.

522
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:44,079
You guessed, Lieutenant?

523
01:08:47,207 --> 01:08:48,583
Lt. Chang is an officer of the law.

524
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:50,168
He's familiar with the likes
of Chiu Ming.

525
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:56,091
Wasn't Lt. Chang himself an outlaw

526
01:08:56,216 --> 01:08:58,760
before he joined the constabulary?

527
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:01,805
Let's not digress.

528
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:05,600
Chiu Ming was stealing

529
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,894
and Lt. Chang confronted him.

530
01:09:08,019 --> 01:09:09,938
In shame and anger,

531
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:11,857
he threw Lt. Chang
from the Scripture Hall!

532
01:09:12,107 --> 01:09:14,276
Chiu Ming! Is it true?

533
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:16,570
Yes.

534
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:21,658
General Wang,

535
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:25,787
I've heard that Lt. Chang
is a martial artist.

536
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:27,622
Indeed he is!

537
01:09:28,707 --> 01:09:32,377
Then how is it that he was
thrown down the stairs?

538
01:09:33,003 --> 01:09:35,755
No, no, no! This is a sacred place!

539
01:09:35,881 --> 01:09:38,216
I would never violate
its sanctity by fighting.

540
01:09:44,264 --> 01:09:49,060
Lt. Chang would've
arrested him anywhere else.

541
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,566
But the temple

542
01:09:55,192 --> 01:09:57,027
is under the Abbot's jurisdiction.

543
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:05,952
Hui Tung, what do you think
should be done?

544
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:07,996
According to the rules,

545
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:11,666
he should be expelled for thievery.

546
01:10:12,751 --> 01:10:14,628
He assaulted an officer of the law

547
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:18,715
and should be remanded
to General Wang.

548
01:10:23,887 --> 01:10:26,181
Hui Wen, what do you think?

549
01:10:31,228 --> 01:10:33,480
The Scripture Hall
has long been my responsibility.

550
01:10:34,314 --> 01:10:38,652
If Chiu Ming trespassed there,

551
01:10:38,777 --> 01:10:40,570
I am at fault.

552
01:10:41,071 --> 01:10:44,074
But I don't understand how it was

553
01:10:44,658 --> 01:10:47,118
that Lieutenant Chang
happened to be there.

554
01:10:50,372 --> 01:10:52,040
Leave that aside for now.

555
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:55,252
And you, Hui Ssu?

556
01:10:55,377 --> 01:10:56,253
Punish him!

557
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:08,390
May I ask why?

558
01:11:09,474 --> 01:11:12,560
Because that's the only way
to satisfy General Wang.

559
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,528
Bind Chiu Ming to the Scripture Hall.

560
01:11:29,244 --> 01:11:32,789
General, I fear the Abbot

561
01:11:32,914 --> 01:11:34,916
is onto your scheme.

562
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:37,711
He's a senile old man in his 90s,
he won't see through it.

563
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:39,671
He's not senile in the least.

564
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:42,799
And Wu Wai is suspicious too.

565
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:46,720
It isn't looking good.

566
01:11:47,304 --> 01:11:50,265
Only you and Chiu Ming
know what happened.

567
01:11:51,141 --> 01:11:53,059
He's tied to the Scripture Hall.

568
01:11:55,854 --> 01:11:58,064
Wait a bit, then go and finish him off.

569
01:12:14,164 --> 01:12:15,040
Jump!

570
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:27,260
Why are you freeing me?

571
01:12:27,469 --> 01:12:28,720
By order of Esquire Wen -

572
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:30,263
he wants to befriend you.

573
01:12:30,388 --> 01:12:33,016
Isn't this in defiance
of the Abbot's orders?

574
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:36,436
Not at all.

575
01:12:40,065 --> 01:12:40,774
It won't work.

576
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:43,234
Why not?

577
01:12:47,072 --> 01:12:52,577
Killing Chiu Ming
would be of no avail.

578
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:58,041
A murder while we were here

579
01:12:58,166 --> 01:13:01,753
would reflect badly on us.

580
01:13:04,464 --> 01:13:06,591
We came for the scroll,

581
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:08,510
let's not complicate matters.

582
01:13:08,968 --> 01:13:09,803
You're right.

583
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:12,222
Forget it.

584
01:13:14,182 --> 01:13:16,810
General, go to the Abbot immediately

585
01:13:16,935 --> 01:13:19,479
and ask him to release Chiu Ming.

586
01:13:21,356 --> 01:13:23,441
You'll make a good impression.

587
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,902
I can't go back
on what I said earlier.

588
01:13:27,237 --> 01:13:28,363
You can!

589
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:32,033
Your Reverence,

590
01:13:32,367 --> 01:13:34,702
yesterday my anger blinded me.

591
01:13:34,828 --> 01:13:37,163
I didn't think Chiu Ming
would be treated so harshly.

592
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:39,666
Now I regret it. Can you pardon him?

593
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:43,169
General, he deserves his punishment.

594
01:13:47,215 --> 01:13:48,758
He's been there for hours.

595
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:50,301
Surely he's suffered enough.

596
01:13:50,677 --> 01:13:53,847
Can't he be released now?

597
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:04,190
It's getting late.
Perhaps the General should rest.

598
01:14:05,692 --> 01:14:07,861
We'll discuss this another time.

599
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:10,238
See the General out.

600
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:11,573
Yes.

601
01:14:15,285 --> 01:14:16,327
Goodnight.

602
01:14:16,453 --> 01:14:17,370
General...

603
01:14:17,704 --> 01:14:18,413
Yes?

604
01:14:18,538 --> 01:14:21,708
Tomorrow the monks will be tested

605
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:23,543
and a new abbot will be chosen.

606
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:26,296
Please be there to advise us.

607
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:30,467
Certainly.

608
01:15:37,367 --> 01:15:38,993
Gentleman, have you studied

609
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:40,662
the three disciples' answers?

610
01:15:40,912 --> 01:15:42,372
Yes.

611
01:15:43,998 --> 01:15:44,958
All excellent.

612
01:15:46,709 --> 01:15:48,419
General, what do you think?

613
01:15:49,003 --> 01:15:51,548
Their answers are all very good.

614
01:15:52,799 --> 01:15:53,800
Approach!

615
01:16:00,807 --> 01:16:04,602
Of all the temple's monks, you three

616
01:16:04,727 --> 01:16:09,440
have the best knowledge of Buddhism.

617
01:16:09,566 --> 01:16:11,943
Each of you is worthy
of the abbot ship.

618
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:15,029
Now His Reverence must make a decision.

619
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:21,494
The three of you go to the pond
behind the temple

620
01:16:21,619 --> 01:16:23,913
and each fetch a bucket of clear water.

621
01:16:25,081 --> 01:16:26,082
Will do.

622
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,692
Is the water in your buckets clear?

623
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:53,568
Yes!

624
01:16:55,486 --> 01:16:58,114
Hui Tung, tell me

625
01:16:58,448 --> 01:17:00,700
how you got your clear water?

626
01:17:04,037 --> 01:17:06,122
Only by working with my brothers

627
01:17:06,247 --> 01:17:07,915
was I able to obtain clear water.

628
01:17:09,250 --> 01:17:11,127
Explain your answer.

629
01:17:11,836 --> 01:17:13,421
Only when the many streams

630
01:17:13,546 --> 01:17:14,922
have run to the sea

631
01:17:15,048 --> 01:17:17,634
does it reflect the full moon.

632
01:17:44,619 --> 01:17:46,704
Hui Wen?

633
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:49,499
I filtered the water through fine gauze...

634
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:53,378
for only by ridding oneself
of worldly ideas

635
01:17:53,503 --> 01:17:55,296
can one rediscover his true nature.

636
01:18:13,022 --> 01:18:14,232
Hui Ssu?

637
01:18:14,357 --> 01:18:15,525
Let nature take its course...

638
01:18:18,277 --> 01:18:19,737
clear heart, clear water.

639
01:20:00,963 --> 01:20:02,131
Hui Ssu!

640
01:20:04,926 --> 01:20:06,177
Come forward!

641
01:20:16,813 --> 01:20:17,730
Come, come.

642
01:21:03,359 --> 01:21:05,653
This is a large temple, with many monks.

643
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:09,699
Therefore, to avoid internal disputes,

644
01:21:10,074 --> 01:21:13,077
an outsider shall become the new abbot.

645
01:21:13,202 --> 01:21:17,540
He shall assume the mantle of leadership.

646
01:21:21,586 --> 01:21:22,545
Chiu Ming!

647
01:21:27,633 --> 01:21:30,219
Chiu Ming! Come forth!

648
01:21:58,789 --> 01:21:59,832
Kneel.

649
01:22:23,689 --> 01:22:28,069
Henceforth, you shall
be called Hui Ming.

650
01:22:28,819 --> 01:22:31,238
You shall take my place

651
01:22:31,364 --> 01:22:33,449
in upholding temple traditions

652
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:35,493
and propagating Buddhist doctrine.

653
01:22:35,618 --> 01:22:36,535
Rise!

654
01:23:06,565 --> 01:23:07,608
Now?

655
01:23:10,861 --> 01:23:14,824
Hui Ming has been chosen
as the new abbot.

656
01:23:15,241 --> 01:23:17,368
Respect him as you would the old abbot.

657
01:23:18,244 --> 01:23:19,286
Turn!

658
01:23:25,459 --> 01:23:26,585
Bow.

659
01:23:55,197 --> 01:23:57,450
Abbot Hui Ming is now in charge.

660
01:24:15,468 --> 01:24:20,347
These are the temple's accounts.

661
01:24:21,348 --> 01:24:23,976
Hui Wen will answer
any questions you have.

662
01:24:25,519 --> 01:24:29,940
This is Tripitaka's Mahayana Sutra.

663
01:24:34,403 --> 01:24:38,616
It has long been
a source of trouble here.

664
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:40,743
Deal with it properly.

665
01:24:40,868 --> 01:24:42,203
Surely.

666
01:24:46,040 --> 01:24:49,210
Tomorrow the old Abbot will retire...

667
01:24:55,758 --> 01:24:57,134
to prepare for Nirvana.

668
01:24:57,259 --> 01:25:00,596
We will see him off to South Mountain

669
01:25:01,013 --> 01:25:03,057
by reciting the Amitabha Sutra.

670
01:25:03,808 --> 01:25:05,768
This is absurd!
A convict as abbot!

671
01:25:05,893 --> 01:25:07,311
It's completely inappropriate!

672
01:25:07,645 --> 01:25:10,147
He'll find it's not easy being abbot.

673
01:25:10,272 --> 01:25:12,108
He still has me to reckon with!

674
01:25:12,691 --> 01:25:15,069
Gentlemen, please excuse me.

675
01:25:15,361 --> 01:25:16,362
Very well.

676
01:25:27,414 --> 01:25:28,499
I pity him.

677
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:29,375
Who?

678
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,377
Hui Tung. All his efforts were in vain.

679
01:25:32,837 --> 01:25:35,005
A monk so power hungry

680
01:25:35,131 --> 01:25:36,757
isn't fit to be abbot.

681
01:25:43,222 --> 01:25:45,558
Should I have a talk with the old abbot?

682
01:25:46,058 --> 01:25:46,934
About what?

683
01:25:48,853 --> 01:25:51,188
To suggest he appoint Hui Tung instead.

684
01:25:51,397 --> 01:25:52,439
On what grounds?

685
01:25:52,898 --> 01:25:55,359
As district governor I won't allow

686
01:25:55,484 --> 01:25:59,155
a convict to serve as abbot.

687
01:25:59,446 --> 01:26:00,698
I simply won't allow it.

688
01:26:02,867 --> 01:26:03,450
Don't do it!

689
01:26:03,576 --> 01:26:06,495
We have to win Chiu Ming over now.

690
01:26:07,705 --> 01:26:10,291
How? He hates our guts.

691
01:26:13,794 --> 01:26:14,795
I'll see to it.

692
01:26:21,302 --> 01:26:23,137
Over here! Gather around.

693
01:26:23,262 --> 01:26:24,513
Hui Tung has something to say.

694
01:26:36,942 --> 01:26:38,027
Listen...

695
01:26:38,152 --> 01:26:38,736
Huh?

696
01:26:38,861 --> 01:26:39,987
Listen to Hui Tung.

697
01:26:40,362 --> 01:26:42,531
Speak of this to no one!

698
01:26:43,073 --> 01:26:45,492
Lead them to the new abbot.

699
01:26:46,452 --> 01:26:48,579
Tell him you're not getting enough to eat

700
01:26:48,704 --> 01:26:50,456
and you're weak from hunger.

701
01:26:50,581 --> 01:26:52,458
Raise a ruckus. I'll back you up.

702
01:26:52,583 --> 01:26:54,835
Come on! Let's give him hell!

703
01:26:55,377 --> 01:26:56,795
Good. I'll leave it to you.

704
01:26:56,921 --> 01:26:57,796
Count on us!

705
01:27:18,192 --> 01:27:19,860
Is there any other business today?

706
01:27:21,737 --> 01:27:23,656
We captured a smuggler this morning.

707
01:27:25,741 --> 01:27:26,575
Your Reverence.

708
01:27:31,038 --> 01:27:33,123
What is it, Lieutenant?

709
01:27:34,917 --> 01:27:38,629
What happened between us earlier

710
01:27:38,837 --> 01:27:40,798
was a misunderstanding.

711
01:27:42,216 --> 01:27:44,051
I'm sorry you suffered for it.

712
01:27:48,889 --> 01:27:51,642
I've already forgotten it

713
01:27:51,976 --> 01:27:53,769
and I hope you'll forget it too.

714
01:27:58,649 --> 01:28:01,694
There's something else
you should know.

715
01:28:02,653 --> 01:28:04,405
Please speak freely, sir.

716
01:28:04,863 --> 01:28:09,076
The food here is...

717
01:28:10,577 --> 01:28:11,620
What?

718
01:28:16,667 --> 01:28:19,128
The food here in the temple is awful.

719
01:28:19,420 --> 01:28:21,046
All the monks are complaining.

720
01:28:21,839 --> 01:28:24,842
I just overheard Hui Tung inciting them

721
01:28:24,967 --> 01:28:27,386
to confront you about it.

722
01:28:27,511 --> 01:28:29,179
I've come to let you know

723
01:28:29,305 --> 01:28:30,597
so you won't be taken by surprise.

724
01:28:31,515 --> 01:28:32,891
How can you let us starve?

725
01:28:34,476 --> 01:28:35,811
What does it matter?

726
01:28:35,936 --> 01:28:36,937
What if it goes too far?

727
01:28:37,062 --> 01:28:38,188
Don't worry!
Hui Tung will back us up!

728
01:28:38,314 --> 01:28:39,315
Yes!

729
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:41,358
What if he doesn't?

730
01:28:41,650 --> 01:28:43,485
We'll leave the monk hood!

731
01:28:44,695 --> 01:28:46,488
Easy to say! How would we get by?

732
01:28:46,613 --> 01:28:48,282
A bowl of gruel isn't hard to come by.

733
01:28:48,407 --> 01:28:49,783
If you two want to back out,

734
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:52,036
let's just forget it!

735
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:04,173
Your Reverence! We'd like a word with you.

736
01:29:07,634 --> 01:29:08,761
Very well.

737
01:29:13,932 --> 01:29:15,225
Is it about the food?

738
01:29:15,351 --> 01:29:16,727
Yes!

739
01:29:19,772 --> 01:29:20,939
You still want to go through with it?

740
01:29:23,108 --> 01:29:26,362
Master, you know what we eat.

741
01:29:26,487 --> 01:29:28,405
- I do.
- Watery gruel,

742
01:29:28,530 --> 01:29:30,032
and little else!

743
01:29:30,157 --> 01:29:31,450
Monks are falling sick every day!

744
01:29:31,575 --> 01:29:33,202
They're weak and can't see well at night.

745
01:29:33,327 --> 01:29:34,578
Sick? We're starving!

746
01:29:34,703 --> 01:29:36,330
Ravaged by hunger!

747
01:29:37,164 --> 01:29:38,707
What's going on here?

748
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:44,129
What's all the shouting about?

749
01:29:54,932 --> 01:29:56,058
Quiet?

750
01:29:58,685 --> 01:30:01,271
We'll find a way to improve the food,

751
01:30:02,439 --> 01:30:04,024
but there'll be other changes as well.

752
01:30:04,650 --> 01:30:06,610
From now on, monks will not spend

753
01:30:06,735 --> 01:30:08,445
the entire day in contemplation.

754
01:30:08,904 --> 01:30:10,531
They'll do farm work as well.

755
01:30:10,906 --> 01:30:11,907
Plant crops?

756
01:30:12,282 --> 01:30:14,410
Monks farming? Is he serious?

757
01:30:14,535 --> 01:30:15,619
Quiet!

758
01:30:16,578 --> 01:30:17,496
Your Reverence,

759
01:30:17,621 --> 01:30:20,374
I don't think it will work.

760
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:21,542
Yes, it will.

761
01:30:26,213 --> 01:30:27,840
We don't know how to farm!

762
01:30:28,882 --> 01:30:30,092
Then learn.

763
01:30:30,592 --> 01:30:31,677
From whom?

764
01:30:34,138 --> 01:30:35,389
I'll teach you.

765
01:30:38,517 --> 01:30:39,643
Disperse now.

766
01:30:43,856 --> 01:30:45,441
We need more food!

767
01:30:45,858 --> 01:30:47,359
How can we farm on empty stomachs?

768
01:30:52,906 --> 01:30:54,158
- He's left.
- Let's go.

769
01:30:57,453 --> 01:31:00,831
Solving the food problem won't be easy.

770
01:31:01,415 --> 01:31:03,125
You've seen the temple accounts.

771
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:07,546
What we take in barely covers expenses.

772
01:31:07,963 --> 01:31:11,049
We don't have the money for more food.

773
01:31:12,885 --> 01:31:14,094
Then go collect alms.

774
01:31:14,761 --> 01:31:17,306
I'm in charge of alms collection.

775
01:31:17,723 --> 01:31:20,559
Money's scarce this year!

776
01:31:22,144 --> 01:31:23,228
Then borrow!

777
01:31:24,021 --> 01:31:24,897
Your Reverence!

778
01:31:26,607 --> 01:31:28,859
We've nothing to put up for collateral

779
01:31:28,984 --> 01:31:30,277
unless we go to Esquire Wen.

780
01:31:30,402 --> 01:31:31,695
Then go to him now.

781
01:31:35,782 --> 01:31:37,868
Your Reverence, the food situation...

782
01:31:37,993 --> 01:31:39,077
It will be rectified tomorrow.

783
01:31:53,050 --> 01:31:54,259
These are the ones.

784
01:31:55,093 --> 01:31:56,637
They've been eating meat and drinking wine.

785
01:31:57,262 --> 01:31:58,931
He's their supplier.

786
01:31:59,139 --> 01:32:00,474
We caught them this morning.

787
01:32:01,517 --> 01:32:02,601
Where did they get the money?

788
01:32:02,726 --> 01:32:03,936
From Hui Wen.

789
01:32:04,520 --> 01:32:06,355
Brother, what are you saying?

790
01:32:06,480 --> 01:32:07,564
They confessed to it.

791
01:32:07,689 --> 01:32:10,734
I sent them to buy provisions.

792
01:32:10,859 --> 01:32:13,695
I didn't tell them to break their vows!

793
01:32:17,824 --> 01:32:20,077
How were such matters handled in the past?

794
01:32:20,244 --> 01:32:22,079
For monks, three months
of solitary confinement.

795
01:32:22,246 --> 01:32:24,248
For laypeople, a severe caning.

796
01:32:24,373 --> 01:32:25,457
I'll take care of it.

797
01:32:25,582 --> 01:32:27,417
Fine. But we'll initiate a new procedure.

798
01:32:27,793 --> 01:32:31,088
Monks will go to the rear courtyard

799
01:32:31,213 --> 01:32:32,422
and clear land to plant vegetables.

800
01:32:32,673 --> 01:32:34,883
Turn the smuggler over
to Lieutenant Chang

801
01:32:35,092 --> 01:32:36,426
to await trial.

802
01:32:37,636 --> 01:32:38,845
- Your Reverence...
- Do as I say.

803
01:32:38,971 --> 01:32:40,138
Go now!

804
01:32:45,686 --> 01:32:47,271
- Take care of it immediately!
- Yes, sir.

805
01:32:49,106 --> 01:32:50,399
How dare you defame me?

806
01:32:51,817 --> 01:32:52,776
Your Reverence.

807
01:32:54,444 --> 01:32:55,362
Esquire Wen.

808
01:32:56,113 --> 01:32:57,823
I was on my way to see you.

809
01:32:58,365 --> 01:33:00,993
And I was just on my way
to congratulate you

810
01:33:01,118 --> 01:33:02,077
but I saw you were very busy.

811
01:33:02,202 --> 01:33:04,079
No congratulations, please.

812
01:33:07,291 --> 01:33:08,375
Esquire...

813
01:33:09,543 --> 01:33:11,545
we want to improve the food here.

814
01:33:11,962 --> 01:33:13,380
Can you help us?

815
01:33:13,505 --> 01:33:14,965
I'd help if I could,

816
01:33:15,507 --> 01:33:18,427
but as Hui Wen knows,

817
01:33:18,552 --> 01:33:19,970
I'm having difficulties myself.

818
01:33:21,096 --> 01:33:22,139
Well...

819
01:33:22,347 --> 01:33:25,100
could you help us borrow?

820
01:33:27,686 --> 01:33:30,397
Lenders want collateral for loans.

821
01:33:33,817 --> 01:33:36,028
We could mortgage the temple property.

822
01:33:37,446 --> 01:33:40,616
The lenders wouldn't accept it.

823
01:33:41,366 --> 01:33:42,284
Why not?

824
01:33:42,868 --> 01:33:46,455
If you defaulted,
they couldn't sell the temple.

825
01:33:53,253 --> 01:33:54,504
Is there any other way?

826
01:33:56,715 --> 01:33:59,301
With the Tripitaka scroll as security,

827
01:33:59,676 --> 01:34:01,219
you could borrow a large sum.

828
01:34:05,724 --> 01:34:06,892
How much?

829
01:34:07,476 --> 01:34:10,479
Tens of thousands of taels of silver.

830
01:34:14,858 --> 01:34:17,903
Fine. First give
Hui Wen a draft for 10,000 taels.

831
01:34:18,278 --> 01:34:19,571
As for the scroll,

832
01:34:19,696 --> 01:34:22,866
let me think about it.

833
01:34:23,158 --> 01:34:26,244
Here are two drafts,
each worth 10,000 taels.

834
01:34:27,204 --> 01:34:28,789
One for the temple, one for you.

835
01:34:41,802 --> 01:34:43,387
And here's the key to Scripture Hall.

836
01:34:43,929 --> 01:34:46,014
If he changes his mind,
resort to your original plan.

837
01:34:48,725 --> 01:34:49,685
Madame!

838
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:03,073
If they steal it,

839
01:35:03,323 --> 01:35:05,659
it won't cost me anything.

840
01:35:17,462 --> 01:35:18,255
Let's go.

841
01:35:23,385 --> 01:35:25,762
How can I explain a murder
in the temple?

842
01:35:25,929 --> 01:35:26,930
Leave it to me!

843
01:35:27,222 --> 01:35:29,182
But he's the abbot!

844
01:35:34,104 --> 01:35:35,147
You go first.

845
01:35:37,816 --> 01:35:39,234
Understand?

846
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:44,281
On my own I'm no match for him.

847
01:35:44,406 --> 01:35:46,533
Don't worry. I've got your back.

848
01:35:49,661 --> 01:35:52,497
Go on! Go!

849
01:36:02,382 --> 01:36:03,258
Your Reverence!

850
01:36:09,347 --> 01:36:10,390
Madame.

851
01:36:10,682 --> 01:36:11,683
Your Reverence!

852
01:36:13,477 --> 01:36:15,771
Hui Tung and Chang Cheng
are plotting to kill you!

853
01:36:16,313 --> 01:36:17,397
Madame...

854
01:36:18,398 --> 01:36:19,399
Madame!

855
01:37:49,447 --> 01:37:53,118
Put some salve on it
and you'll be fine.

856
01:37:54,119 --> 01:37:56,454
Then go watch over
the Scripture Hall tonight.

857
01:37:58,832 --> 01:38:01,418
If there's any trouble there,

858
01:38:02,252 --> 01:38:04,004
I'll hold you responsible.

859
01:38:05,130 --> 01:38:06,006
Now go!

860
01:42:14,629 --> 01:42:16,047
Have you seen Chang Cheng?

861
01:42:17,173 --> 01:42:18,716
Go out the back.
Meet me at the riverside.

862
01:42:30,061 --> 01:42:31,271
See you there!

863
01:42:39,028 --> 01:42:39,863
Esquire Wen,

864
01:42:39,988 --> 01:42:42,866
I...

865
01:42:44,951 --> 01:42:47,328
Well, this has been an eventful visit.

866
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:48,788
Indeed it has.

867
01:42:50,456 --> 01:42:52,542
Are you leaving today too, General?

868
01:42:52,876 --> 01:42:57,255
Yes. I've official duties to attend to.

869
01:42:57,714 --> 01:42:59,549
Then I won't delay you further.

870
01:42:59,674 --> 01:43:01,467
You're too polite!

871
01:43:02,927 --> 01:43:05,263
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

872
01:43:06,014 --> 01:43:07,849
- After you.
- Please.

873
01:43:39,214 --> 01:43:40,298
Chang Cheng!

874
01:43:47,138 --> 01:43:48,139
Chang Cheng!

875
01:44:06,532 --> 01:44:09,369
"White Fox has scroll. In pursuit.

876
01:44:09,869 --> 01:44:11,454
Await you at riverside."

877
01:44:12,497 --> 01:44:16,793
Damn it! Where by the riverside?

878
01:44:37,355 --> 01:44:38,106
Hurry!

879
01:45:48,843 --> 01:45:49,802
Run!

880
01:49:08,668 --> 01:49:09,293
Run!

881
01:49:09,418 --> 01:49:09,961
What about Gold Lock?

882
01:49:10,086 --> 01:49:11,003
Run!

883
01:49:31,857 --> 01:49:32,858
Chang Cheng.

884
01:49:33,693 --> 01:49:34,860
Isn't this Gold Lock?

885
01:49:41,033 --> 01:49:41,909
After them!

886
01:49:42,076 --> 01:49:43,035
Come on!

887
01:49:57,717 --> 01:49:58,467
Hurry!

888
01:50:22,908 --> 01:50:25,911
I say, sir, can you ferry us across?

889
01:50:33,377 --> 01:50:35,004
I'll pay you 10 taels of silver.

890
01:50:38,090 --> 01:50:39,592
20, then!

891
01:50:39,717 --> 01:50:40,885
All right?

892
01:50:47,266 --> 01:50:48,100
Let's go!

893
01:50:54,357 --> 01:50:55,066
Hurry!

894
01:51:43,364 --> 01:51:44,073
Wait!

895
01:51:44,949 --> 01:51:45,366
What?

896
01:51:45,491 --> 01:51:47,243
You haven't paid him.

897
01:51:48,953 --> 01:51:49,912
On second thought...

898
01:51:50,788 --> 01:51:52,707
What if he betrays us?

899
01:51:52,915 --> 01:51:54,083
Better yet...

900
01:51:54,917 --> 01:51:55,918
That won't do!

901
01:52:02,216 --> 01:52:04,510
Old fellow, I forgot to pay you.

902
01:52:10,266 --> 01:52:13,936
Old fellow, over here, over here!

903
01:52:47,470 --> 01:52:50,639
Please, sir... stop!

904
01:57:17,156 --> 01:57:18,198
Esquire Wen.

905
01:57:21,618 --> 01:57:22,619
Brother Hui Wen.

906
01:57:23,245 --> 01:57:24,288
Esquire Wen.

907
01:57:24,705 --> 01:57:27,374
I've told the Abbot all about our plot.

908
01:57:28,584 --> 01:57:31,378
You stole and murdered
on temple grounds.

909
01:57:31,795 --> 01:57:33,130
How will you account for that?

910
01:57:33,714 --> 01:57:35,090
Chang Cheng attacked me!

911
01:57:36,133 --> 01:57:37,885
But you've no proof of it!

912
01:57:38,177 --> 01:57:39,303
Chang Cheng was a known killer.

913
01:57:39,428 --> 01:57:41,764
The brute got what he deserved.

914
01:57:41,889 --> 01:57:43,974
That may indeed be so,

915
01:57:44,099 --> 01:57:45,934
but the law won't see it that way!

916
01:57:46,060 --> 01:57:49,480
Then... what can I do?

917
01:57:50,731 --> 01:57:54,526
Return with me and
beg for the Abbot's mercy.

918
01:57:54,651 --> 01:57:56,361
Perhaps he'll be lenient.

919
01:57:57,112 --> 01:57:58,989
So... all my efforts were in vain?

920
01:58:00,115 --> 01:58:01,575
I'm afraid so.

921
01:58:03,535 --> 01:58:04,661
Go to hell!

922
01:58:07,164 --> 01:58:08,082
Esquire Wen!

923
01:58:09,792 --> 01:58:11,794
Esquire! Not that way...!

924
01:58:28,811 --> 01:58:30,062
This tattered parchment

925
01:58:30,395 --> 01:58:33,148
has caused trouble for far too long.

926
01:58:37,486 --> 01:58:40,280
Now I'm returning it to Tripitaka.

927
01:59:23,031 --> 01:59:24,074
General Wang.

928
01:59:27,244 --> 01:59:30,914
The Mahayana Sutra's true value
is in its meaning.

929
01:59:31,165 --> 01:59:32,833
It should be available to all.

930
01:59:33,542 --> 01:59:35,711
I've made scores of copies.

931
01:59:36,253 --> 01:59:38,714
One of them for you, General.

932
02:00:01,820 --> 02:00:04,114
