the sutras better than most monks do!

Then what's he doing with all those women?

He's immune to sensual pleasures.

Our family owned a rare edition of the Diamond Sutra.

00:48:28,656 --> 00:48:30,466
Going a bit far, wouldn't you say?
這有點兒太過份了吧

Tripitaka's handwritten Mahayana Sutra is kept there.

Take this ginseng to Master Wu Wai.

叫那個流犯管藏經樓

464
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:09,500
What's the deeper meaning of this?
這又是什麼禪機

465
01:01:10,084 --> 01:01:12,920
Perhaps Master will choose Hui Ssu.
我看師父也許會傳衣缽給三師弟

Hui Ssu is too young.

You've managed the temple's assets for many years.

No one is better suited than you.

If Hui Tung should overhear,
這話要是叫大師哥聽見了

472
01:01:41,198 --> 01:01:42,491
there'd be no end of trouble.
可不得了啊

473
01:01:43,659 --> 01:01:45,202
You're both talking rubbish!
你們說的都是廢話

474
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:49,415
Don't be foolhardy!
你可不能太冒失

475
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:52,042
My way is better.

01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:54,420
Listen... wait...!
我跟你說

477
01:02:44,720 --> 01:02:45,888

Let us begin.

Your Reverence!
老禪師

483
01:06:13,679 --> 01:06:17,933
I am your devoted lay friend,
我不但是您老人家方外的好朋友

484
01:06:20,227 --> 01:06:22,145
but I'm also governor of this district.
也是這裡的地方官

485
01:06:24,022 --> 01:06:26,775
There is a matter we must get to the bottom of.
這件事情我們非弄個水落石出不可

486
01:06:27,192 --> 01:06:29,152
Feel free to speak.
施主有話請儘管說

487

Are you aware

488
01:06:36,743 --> 01:06:38,328
of this man's background?
您老人家知道不知道

489

Please go on.

He was arrested and sentenced to the army.

493
01:06:54,886 --> 01:06:56,346
I don't know how he got the money

494
01:06:56,471 --> 01:06:57,931
to buy his way out.
買度牒贖了罪

His Reverence is aware of this.
這些師父都知道

496
01:07:00,267 --> 01:07:02,477
It was the Abbot himself who administered the vows.

497
01:07:05,147 --> 01:07:08,150

01:07:13,989 --> 01:07:17,868
you may be unaware of his background.
您老人家對他的身世也許不清楚

502
01:07:29,546 --> 01:07:30,672
But let's not dwell on that.
先不管這些

503
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:35,343
If he'd reformed, I'd let it go.
他要是能痛改前非  也就罷了

504
01:07:36,011 --> 01:07:37,929
But he's up to his old tricks!
可是  他賊性難改

505
01:07:39,598 --> 01:07:42,142
Oh? How has he erred?

He was stealing in the Scripture Hall.

01:07:55,363 --> 01:07:59,242
Luckily, Chang Cheng was on hand to stop him.

508
01:07:59,659 --> 01:08:00,719
It's a lie!
他瞎說

01:08:04,100 --> 01:08:05,100
Your Reverence...
老禪師

510
01:08:06,583 --> 01:08:09,628
I have reported the incident to the Abbot.

General Wang.
王將軍

01:08:12,714 --> 01:08:15,592
May I question Lieutenant Chang?
我可不可以問張指揮幾句話

513
01:08:16,343 --> 01:08:17,427
Of course.
請

514
01:08:19,846 --> 01:08:20,889
Lieutenant Chang.
張指揮

515
01:08:21,223 --> 01:08:24,101
How do you know he was stealing?
你怎麼知道他是去偷東西的

516
01:08:25,519 --> 01:08:26,645
As it happens,
是這樣的

517
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:29,689
I saw him sneak into the Scripture Hall.
他鬼鬼祟祟地溜進藏經樓

518

When I asked him what he was doing,
我問他到這兒來幹什麼

520
01:08:34,152 --> 01:08:36,321
he couldn't give me a straight answer.
他支支吾吾的答不出來

521
01:08:36,613 --> 01:08:39,533
Then I knew he was up to something.
我馬上就猜到了  他圖謀不軌

522
01:08:41,409 --> 01:08:44,079
You guessed, Lieutenant?
張指揮是猜到的

523
01:08:47,207 --> 01:08:48,583
Lt. Chang is an officer of the law.
張指揮是提刑出身

524
01:08:48,708 --> 01:08:50,168
He's familiar with the likes of Chiu Ming.
對這類人最清楚了

525
01:08:52,045 --> 01:08:56,091
Wasn't Lt. Chang himself an outlaw
聽說張指揮在投效朝廷之前

526
01:08:56,216 --> 01:08:58,760
before he joined the constabulary?
也在江湖上混過

527
01:08:59,761 --> 01:09:01,805
Let's not digress.
先不要談這些題外的話

528
01:09:02,597 --> 01:09:05,600
Chiu Ming was stealing
邱明由藏經樓偷了東西出來

529
01:09:05,892 --> 01:09:07,894

530
01:09:08,019 --> 01:09:09,938
In shame and anger,

531
01:09:10,063 --> 01:09:11,857
he threw Lt. Chang from the Scripture Hall!
還把張誠從樓上打了下來

532
01:09:12,107 --> 01:09:14,276
Chiu Ming! Is it true?
邱明  有沒有這回事

533
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:16,570
Yes.
有

534
01:09:20,448 --> 01:09:21,658
General Wang,
王將軍

535
01:09:21,783 --> 01:09:25,787
I've heard that Lt. Chang is a martial artist.
聽說張指揮的武功造詣很高啊

536
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:27,622
Indeed he is!
相當不錯

537
01:09:28,707 --> 01:09:32,377
Then how is it that he was thrown down the stairs?
那怎麼會讓他從樓上打下來呢

538
01:09:33,003 --> 01:09:35,755
No, no, no! This is a sacred place!
不不不不  這裡是佛門淨地

539
01:09:35,881 --> 01:09:38,216
I would never violate its sanctity by fighting.
我怎麼能夠跟他動武呢

540
01:09:44,264 --> 01:09:49,060
Lt. Chang would've arrested him anywhere else.
要是在外邊兒  張誠立刻就抓他歸案

541
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:54,566
But the temple
可是  現在是在廟裡

542
01:09:55,192 --> 01:09:57,027
is under the Abbot's jurisdiction.
就請老禪師處理吧

543
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:02,900
Hui Tung,
慧通

544
01:10:03,550 --> 01:10:05,950
what do you think should be done?
你看應該怎麼辦

545
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:07,996
According to the rules,
依照廟規

546
01:10:08,121 --> 01:10:11,666
he should be expelled for thievery.

547
01:10:12,751 --> 01:10:14,628
He assaulted an officer of the law

548
01:10:15,253 --> 01:10:18,715
and should be remanded to General Wang.
按照國法  應該把他交王將軍處置

549
01:10:23,887 --> 01:10:26,181
Hui Wen, what do you think?
慧文  你說說看

550
01:10:31,228 --> 01:10:33,480
The Scripture Hall has long been my responsibility.
藏經樓一直是由弟子管

551
01:10:34,314 --> 01:10:38,652
If Chiu Ming trespassed there,
邱明居然能進去  這是弟子失職

552
01:10:38,777 --> 01:10:40,570
I am at fault.
弟子應該負責

553
01:10:41,071 --> 01:10:44,074
But I don't understand how it was
不過  弟子不明白

554
01:10:44,658 --> 01:10:47,118
that Lieutenant Chang happened to be there.
張指揮到藏經樓去幹什麼

555
01:10:50,372 --> 01:10:52,040
Leave that aside for now.
不要說這些了

556
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:55,252
And you, Hui Ssu?
慧思  你說說

557
01:10:55,377 --> 01:10:56,453
Punish him!
要重罰

558
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:08,390
May I ask why?
請問三師傅  什麼理由呢

559
01:11:09,474 --> 01:11:12,560
Because that's the only way to satisfy General Wang.
不重罰  王將軍和張指揮的氣難消

560
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:21,528
Bind Chiu Ming to the Scripture Hall.
把邱明吊在藏經樓上

561
01:11:29,244 --> 01:11:32,789
General, I fear the Abbot
將軍  你這招惡人先告狀

562
01:11:32,914 --> 01:11:34,916
is onto your scheme.
智嚴老住持看穿了

563
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:37,711
He's a senile old man in his 90s, he won't see through it.
他九十多歲了  糊里糊塗的看不穿

564
01:11:38,169 --> 01:11:39,671
He's not senile in the least.
他一點兒也不糊塗

565
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:42,799
And Wu Wai is suspicious too.
還有  悟外的話多厲害

566
01:11:44,634 --> 01:11:46,720
It isn't looking good.
這事有點不妙

567
01:11:47,304 --> 01:11:50,265
Only you and Chiu Ming know what happened.
這件事  只有你和邱明知道

568
01:11:51,141 --> 01:11:53,059
He's tied to the Scripture Hall.
他現在綁在藏經樓上

569
01:11:55,854 --> 01:11:58,064
Wait a bit, then go and finish him off.
等會兒你去把他一了百了

570
01:12:14,164 --> 01:12:15,240
Jump!
跳下去

571
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:27,260
Why are you freeing me?
施主  為什麼放我下來

572
01:12:27,469 --> 01:12:28,720
By order of Esquire Wen -
是文安讓我放你的

573
01:12:28,845 --> 01:12:30,263
he wants to befriend you.
他想跟你結個善緣

574
01:12:30,388 --> 01:12:33,016
Isn't this in defiance of the Abbot's orders?
這樣會不會違背師父的原意

575
01:12:35,101 --> 01:12:36,436
Not at all.
不會

576
01:12:40,065 --> 01:12:41,074
It won't work.
不妥當

577
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:43,434
Why not?
怎麼

578
01:12:47,072 --> 01:12:52,577
Killing Chiu Ming would be of no avail.
把邱明除了  於事無補啊

579
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:58,041
A murder while we were here
再說  廟裡出了人命

580
01:12:58,166 --> 01:13:01,753
would reflect badly on us.
有你我在場  傳出去不好聽吶

581
01:13:04,464 --> 01:13:06,591
We came for the scroll,
咱們是為了那個卷子來的

582
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:08,510
let's not complicate matters.
不能節外生枝

583
01:13:08,968 --> 01:13:10,003
You're right.
也對

584
01:13:11,179 --> 01:13:12,322
Forget it.
那就算了

585
01:13:14,182 --> 01:13:16,810
General, go to the Abbot immediately
將軍  你要立刻到老禪師那裡

586
01:13:16,935 --> 01:13:19,479
and ask him to release Chiu Ming.
替邱明講情  把他放下來

587
01:13:21,356 --> 01:13:23,441
You'll make a good impression.
這樣可以結個善緣

588
01:13:23,900 --> 01:13:25,902
I can't go back on what I said earlier.
我出爾反爾  這怎麼行呢

589
01:13:27,237 --> 01:13:28,363
You can!
行

590
01:13:30,990 --> 01:13:32,033
Your Reverence,
難道讓我說

591
01:13:32,367 --> 01:13:34,702
yesterday my anger blinded me.
老禪師  我昨天是在氣頭上

592
01:13:34,828 --> 01:13:37,163
I didn't think Chiu Ming would be treated so harshly.
沒想到使邱明受這麼重的懲罰

593
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:39,666
Now I regret it. Can you pardon him?
我有點兒後悔了  你饒了他吧

594
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:43,169
General, he deserves his punishment.
將軍  他是罪有應得

595
01:13:47,215 --> 01:13:48,758
He's been there for hours.
已經吊了幾個時辰了

596
01:13:48,883 --> 01:13:50,301
Surely he's suffered enough.
也夠他受的了

597
01:13:50,677 --> 01:13:53,847
Can't he be released now?
不如  現在把他放下來吧

598
01:14:01,729 --> 01:14:04,190
It's getting late. Perhaps the General should rest.
時候不早了  將軍也該休息了

599
01:14:05,692 --> 01:14:07,861
We'll discuss this another time.
好好  再說吧

600
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:10,238
See the General out.
你送送將軍

601
01:14:10,488 --> 01:14:11,573
Yes.
是

602
01:14:15,285 --> 01:14:16,327
Goodnight.

603
01:14:16,453 --> 01:14:17,470
General...
將軍

604
01:14:17,500 --> 01:14:18,500
Yes?
什麼事

01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,730
Tomorrow the monks will be tested
從明天起  廟裡的和尚論經證道

606
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:23,543
and a new abbot will be chosen.
然後推舉新住持

607
01:14:23,668 --> 01:14:26,296
Please be there to advise us.
到時候  想請將軍光臨指導

608
01:14:29,215 --> 01:14:30,467
Certainly.
我一定來

609
01:15:37,367 --> 01:15:38,993
Gentleman, have you studied

610
01:15:39,118 --> 01:15:40,662
the three disciples' answers?
二位都看過了吧

611
01:15:40,912 --> 01:15:42,372

01:15:52,799 --> 01:15:53,800
Approach!
過來

616
01:16:00,807 --> 01:16:04,602
Of all the temple's monks, you three
這幾天看下來  廟裡幾百位弟子

617
01:16:04,727 --> 01:16:09,440
have the best knowledge of Buddhism.
你們三個人論經證道成就最高

618
01:16:09,566 --> 01:16:11,943
Each of you is worthy of the abbot ship.
都能主持本寺的大局

619
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:15,029
Now His Reverence must make a decision.
現在  請老禪師定奪

620
01:16:18,074 --> 01:16:21,494
The three of you go to the pond behind the temple

and each fetch a bucket of clear water.

836
01:34:43,929 --> 01:34:46,014

01:34:48,725 --> 01:34:49,785
Madame!
如夫人

838
01:35:01,780 --> 01:35:03,073

it won't cost me anything.

How can I explain a murder in the temple?

01:35:25,929 --> 01:35:26,930
Leave it to me!
有我呢

843
01:35:27,222 --> 01:35:29,182

On my own I'm no match for him.

Don't worry. I've got your back.

Then go watch over the Scripture Hall tonight.
