You've worked there for a while now

90
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,036
自己又没本事
I have no qualifications

They were all here

320
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:15,758
今天早上就不见了
But they're all gone this morning

321
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:18,595
蛇笼不是关得好好的吗？
Weren't the cages shut properly?

322
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:21,532
蛇是畜牲，有什么灵性
But after all they're snakes, it's hard to say

323
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:24,233
老吴，这个人住在蛇铺的隔壁
Old Wu, he lives next door

324
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:29,671
你昨天晚上有没有听到
Did you hear any strange noises...

325
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:31,779
蛇铺里有什么特别的声音
coming from the shop last night?

326
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:38,080
没有，我白天工作很累，睡得很熟
No, I was tired and slept the night through

327
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:41,987
你要小心点，可能逃了不少蛇
Be careful, there're many escaped snakes

328
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:45,593
被蛇咬伤了，要进医院，走吧
Go to a hospital if you get bitten

329
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,058
走吧…
Let's go

330
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:04,205
志宏，昨天晚上我看见了秀娟
Zhihong, I saw Xiujuan last night

331
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:05,974
你看到秀娟？
Xiujuan?

332
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:07,581
要不是她叫我
If she wouldn't have called me...

333
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:09,183
我真的不敢看她
I could not have recognized her

334
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:13,712
真想不到，秀娟打扮起来那么好看
She looks really pretty when dressed up

335
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:19,627
真是黄毛丫头十八变，真可惜呀
She's turned into quite a woman; Too bad!

336
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:20,853
别说了
Stop it

337
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:22,890
你不舒服呀？
Are you alright?

338
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,260
没什么
I'm fine

339
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:30,028
看开点，有什么办法
Forget about it

340
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,834
人家有钱就能搂着秀娟跳舞
Those who have money can dance with her

341
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:34,339
要搂多紧都行
They can hold her as close as they want

342
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:36,978
秀娟再干下去，总要陪男人睡觉
Sooner or later, she'll become a prostitute

343
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,478
有第一次，就有第二次，谁有钱
If there's a first time, there'll be a second

344
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:40,478
谁都能玩她
Whoever has money can have a go

345
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:41,707
不
No

346
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:22,589
别这样吧
Please stop

347
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:24,054
你什么都不答应
Why not?

348
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:25,852
跳舞总不能不跟我跳
You can at least dance with me

349
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:29,396
胡先生，不要这样嘛
Mr. Hu, please

350
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:31,324
好了，你答应跟我去消夜
Alright, if you agree to dine out with me...

351
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:32,523
我就规规矩矩跳
I promise to be a gentleman

352
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,100
最多叫芳芳一起去
We can ask Fang to come along

353
00:59:34,437 --> 00:59:36,268
那你还怕什么？
What else are you scared of?

354
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:46,140
干杯
Cheers

355
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,112
干，干掉
Bottoms up

356
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:02,359
再来一杯，最后一杯
Another glass, the last one

357
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:03,398
不要嘛
Had enough!

358
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,363
不要紧嘛，喝晚了我陪你
Don't worry, I'll be here

359
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:07,525
好，最后一杯
One last glass

360
01:00:07,737 --> 01:00:08,726
最后一杯
Last one

361
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:13,239
我跟你喝，干杯    干杯
-rll drink with you, cheers -Cheers

362
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:25,553
我去一下洗手间就回来
I'm just going to the washroom

363
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:38,060
芳芳，我看秀娟今天晚上一定行了
Fangfang, it's got to be tonight

364
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:39,767
借你地方用用怎么样？
Can I borrow your place?

365
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:41,497
不行
No

366
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:45,504
有办法，你先出去看看她
Alright, go check on her

367
01:01:56,112 --> 01:01:57,704
我没有醉
ain't drunk

368
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,623
喂，你想带她到那儿去？
Where are you taking her?

369
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:18,000
讨厌
What a shock!

370
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:21,432
我的呢？
Hey, where's my reward?

371
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:23,437
有
Here it is

372
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:28,642

快告诉我
Tell me right now

376

那砘锇研憔甏到什么地方去？

01:05:22,685 --> 01:05:23,652
赶快放开我
Let me go

378
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:24,478

那砘锇研憔甏到那里去了？

不关你的事，赶快放开我
It's none of your business

381
01:05:30,126 --> 01:05:31,252
要不我叫了
Let go or I'll scream

382
01:05:57,386 --> 01:05:58,284
他们在那里？
Where are they?

383
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:02,890
放开我，放开我，赶快放开我
Let go of me

放开我…
now let go

387
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:38,092
不要，不要…
No, no, no

求求你，打我…
Please, hit me

390
01:16:47,369 --> 01:16:49,166
你心里不舒服，看开点
Forget about it

391
01:16:49,371 --> 01:16:50,133
有什么办法？
What can you do?

392
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:50,964
你没钱
You're totally broke

393
01:16:51,173 --> 01:16:53,107
人家有钱就能搂着秀娟跳舞
Those who have money can dance with her

394
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:54,639
要搂多紧都行
They can hold her as close as they want

395
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:56,500
我看秀娟再干下去
Sooner or later,

396
01:16:56,712 --> 01:16:57,838
总要陪男人睡觉
she'll become a prostitute

397
01:16:58,046 --> 01:16:59,638
有第一次，就有第二次
If there's a first time, there'll be a second

398
01:16:59,848 --> 01:17:01,839
谁有钱谁就能玩她
Whoever has money can have a go

399
01:17:02,384 --> 01:17:08,755
不，不会的…
No, No, No

400
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:20,762
秀娟，谁有钱，谁就能玩弄你
Xiujuan, whoever has money can touch you

401
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:25,370
我看你还是死了好
I think you'd be better off dead

402
01:17:29,444 --> 01:17:35,349
你别怕，死…受不了什么痛苦
Don't worry, it won't hurt a bit

403
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:39,511
谁都可以玩你，那才活不下去呢
It's better than living as a prostitute

404
01:18:18,927 --> 01:18:24,388
秀娟，你放心，谁糟蹋你
Xiujuan, I promise you

405
01:18:24,599 --> 01:18:27,033
我不会饶过他
I'll take revenge for you

01:19:33,702 --> 01:19:35,397
搬家？
Moving away?

407
01:20:54,382 --> 01:20:58,944
小彪，小彪，替秀娟报仇
Xiaobiao, kill for Xiujuan

408
01:25:07,469 --> 01:25:08,766
胡宝春
Hu Baochun

409
01:25:09,137 --> 01:25:12,629
你糟蹋了秀娟，要不是我救了她
You ruined Xiujuan, lucky that I've saved her

410
01:25:12,841 --> 01:25:16,208
她酒醒后会比蛇咬更痛苦
from her despair

411
01:25:16,978 --> 01:25:19,003
你比这些蛇还要毒
You're more wicked than venom

412
01:26:21,376 --> 01:26:22,400
他好像不在
I don't think he's in

413
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:23,711
再看看
Look again

414
01:26:24,145 --> 01:26:25,476
不用找了，他不在里面
He's not inside

415
01:26:26,247 --> 01:26:27,976
昨天他拿了东西走啦
He took a lot of stuff with him

416
01:26:29,384 --> 01:26:30,408
你是干什么的？
Who are you?

417
01:26:30,752 --> 01:26:32,686
我在蛇铺隔壁开理发店
I'm the hairdresser next door

418
01:27:16,598 --> 01:27:17,826
他可能真的搬走了
He might have really moved

419
01:27:18,199 --> 01:27:19,860
是啊，昨天晚上我真的
Yes, I saw him last night

420
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:21,968
看见他搬了一大堆东西走了
He took a lot of stuff with him

421
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:24,070
有什么证据证明他已经搬走了
What evidence have you got that he's moved?

422
01:27:25,306 --> 01:27:26,466
你们跟我来吧
Please come with me

423
01:28:22,764 --> 01:28:23,731
走吧      好
-Let's go -OK

424
01:29:30,264 --> 01:29:31,288
小彪
Xiaobiao

425
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:36,503
原谅我，我实在不愿意这样做
Please forgive me, I have no choice

426
01:29:36,904 --> 01:29:38,997
我只是不愿意警察抓到你们
I just don't want the police to capture you

427
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:40,902
虐待你们
And they'll torture you

428
01:29:42,844 --> 01:29:46,245
永别了，我的好朋友
Goodbye, my friends

429
01:31:52,473 --> 01:31:56,034
小彪，你怎么回来了？
Why've you come back, Xiaobiao?

430
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:57,569
来呀…
Come here

431
01:31:58,279 --> 01:32:00,372
哎呀，你咬我
You bit me

432
01:32:01,148 --> 01:32:03,514
小彪，你咬我，是我
Xiaobiao, you bit me

433
01:32:12,927 --> 01:32:14,827
你身上怎么烧成这个样子了
Look at your burn marks

434
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:23,635
好可怜呀，小彪，是我不好…
Poor thing, it's my fault...

435
01:32:30,011 --> 01:32:33,037
原谅我吧，来呀…
Forgive me then, come on...

436
01:33:48,923 --> 01:33:54,520
救命啊，救命啊
Help ! Help!
