1
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:31,657
Hit me! Hit me...

2
00:00:36,636 --> 00:00:43,338
Hit me, hit me again

3
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:47,736
C'mon, hit me! As hard as you can

4
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:05,648
You drink this first

5
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:07,122
No!

6
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:08,689
What're you scared of?

7
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,226
No, I won't drink

8
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,430
c'mon,
I'll have a sip first, then your turn

9
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:40,589
Let's enjoy ourselves tonight

10
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,420
I hate you, you're a scoundrel

11
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:51,660
What's wrong with you?

12
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:56,205
I didn't mean it

13
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:59,972
Hit him! Hit him hard

14
00:03:14,961 --> 00:03:16,588
Zhihong

15
00:03:18,431 --> 00:03:20,593
It's dirty and smells

16
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,337
It's over

17
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,873
-Here you go
-Thanks

18
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:33,010
Get lost, I'm running a business here

19
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,539
Beat it

20
00:03:41,487 --> 00:03:42,613
You aren't being paid
to read the newspaper

21
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,415
Get to work

22
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:51,407
Zhihong

23
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,250
What, you wanna bring the place down?

24
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,588
Are you crazy? Stop breaking my stuff

25
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:40,626
What's the matter with you?

26
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:08,116
Ill wrap this up for you

27
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,828
Xiujuan, I...

28
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:17,401
Five dollars only, it's cheap

29
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:19,028
Wrap it up

30
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,663
Please wait

31
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:25,345
Poor thing, he gets bullied everywhere!

32
00:07:52,438 --> 00:07:53,462
Have a seat

33
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,346
You're hiring a delivery man?

34
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:02,939
The boss is at the back

35
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:13,920
The boss is right there

36
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:15,150
Over there

37
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:24,434
Boss

38
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,699
You have to be hardworking

39
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:28,999
And don't wander around on the streets

40
00:08:29,208 --> 00:08:30,801
10 a.m. to 11p.m.

41
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:32,307
You'll deliver order by order

42
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,274
Four hundred dollars a month

43
00:08:33,479 --> 00:08:35,413
You don't eat or sleep here

44
00:08:35,615 --> 00:08:36,946
And you'll
pay for dishes you break, alright?

45
00:08:37,149 --> 00:08:38,082
Yes, I will take the job

46
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,749
-30,000!
-Triple!

47
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:43,076
Hey, what are you doing here?

48
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:58,461
It's blood, you poor thing

49
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,688
They took your gall bladder

50
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,790
And then you got thrown away,

51
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:13,573
it's so cruel

52
00:10:14,146 --> 00:10:15,773
They don't care whether you live or die

53
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,842
Don't be scared

54
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:22,113
I'll take care of your wound

55
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,782
Let me get something to stop the bleeding

56
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:33,924
I'll have to attend to the wound...

57
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:36,261
or else you'll be dead in a week

58
00:10:37,837 --> 00:10:40,169
Don't be scared, there'll be stitches

59
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:45,277
It won't hurt

60
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:51,945
Have a good rest,
you'll heal in a few days

61
00:10:58,591 --> 00:11:01,083
Don't worry, I'll be gentle

62
00:11:04,363 --> 00:11:05,626
It's done

63
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,901
They are too cruel,
the gall bladder's use...

64
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:10,660
is exaggerated, they shouldn't have

65
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:14,466
A snake's life
is just as precious as human's

66
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,235
Do you agree?

67
00:11:34,694 --> 00:11:36,458
You seem to understand me

68
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:38,924
I'm not like them

69
00:11:39,131 --> 00:11:42,157
So stay put and have a good rest

70
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,733
Have a good sleep

71
00:12:31,117 --> 00:12:37,352
Xiujuan, I didn't expect to find you here!

72
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,484
Oh, it's you! Look at you

73
00:13:16,328 --> 00:13:17,557
Has the wound healed?

74
00:13:28,774 --> 00:13:30,538
Seem to be doing quite well

75
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,551
Just listen to me

76
00:13:40,753 --> 00:13:42,721
You'll recover in a couple of days

77
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,549
Look at how you're crawling!

78
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,250
Ill name you Xiaobiao, alright?

79
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:54,592
Right, Xiaobiao, go to sleep now

80
00:14:03,809 --> 00:14:05,573
Anything you want to tell me?

81
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,497
I've found another friend

82
00:14:37,142 --> 00:14:38,667
They all got their gall bladders taken out

83
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,440
Do you want me to help them?

84
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:47,512
No problem,
your friends are my friends too

85
00:14:47,853 --> 00:14:49,753
I'll heal them

86
00:14:51,590 --> 00:14:52,989
You're welcome

87
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:09,701
You're off already?
Your job seems to be good

88
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:10,899
You've worked there for a while now

89
00:15:12,444 --> 00:15:14,037
I have no qualifications

90
00:15:14,246 --> 00:15:15,543
All jobs are the same

91
00:15:16,448 --> 00:15:20,646
But I can keep working at this one

92
00:15:22,655 --> 00:15:23,781
Xiujuan

93
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:25,921
Yes?

94
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:32,128
I'd like to take you to a movie

95
00:15:32,798 --> 00:15:36,325
How about the midnight show tonight?

96
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,305
See you tonight then

97
00:15:54,486 --> 00:15:55,681
Come again

98
00:15:57,356 --> 00:15:58,551
Hey, your take-away order is here

99
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:01,291
Sorry

100
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,222
Damn, couldn't you be a bit more careful?

101
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,355
Sorry

102
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,064
What are you looking at?

103
00:16:12,371 --> 00:16:13,361
Haven't you seen a woman before?

104
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,306
Look closer, your mother is similar to me

105
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,246
Have an eyeful! You...

106
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:33,982
Damn

107
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,691
I won't charge, look!

108
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:40,163
Look!

109
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,968
Look!

110
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:48,395
That's enough, leave him alone

111
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:32,816
Get up!

112
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:38,923
Where did your money go?

113
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:45,730
Tell us!

114
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:47,895
Strip search

115
00:18:25,337 --> 00:18:26,566
Damn!

116
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,072
Go

117
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:01,731
Xiujuan, your father's dying

118
00:19:03,175 --> 00:19:05,303
You better hurry

119
00:19:07,246 --> 00:19:08,645
Never mind that, c'mon go

120
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,144
I'll take care of this

121
00:19:20,726 --> 00:19:21,784
Open up

122
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,964
You're back, think of something

123
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:26,596
He can't just die here

124
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:27,959
Father

125
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,657
You've to hurry
and send him to the hospital

126
00:19:30,235 --> 00:19:30,997
Look at him

127
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:31,863
If he dies here...

128
00:19:32,070 --> 00:19:33,435
I can never rent the room out again

129
00:19:33,639 --> 00:19:34,231
And I'll hold you responsible then

130
00:19:34,439 --> 00:19:35,133
Be quiet

131
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:36,967
My father won't die

132
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,837
You're quite fierce

133
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:39,975
Just hurry and get him out of here

134
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,179
I don't care
even if you leave him on the street

135
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:45,540
You'll have to think of something, Xiujuan

136
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:46,547
I can't do that

137
00:19:46,752 --> 00:19:50,450
1...Father

138
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:53,988
Please call the emergency line...

139
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,319
for the ambulance

140
00:19:55,527 --> 00:19:58,827
The ambulance, alright

141
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:02,799
Don't worry, Xiujuan

142
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,435
The hospital will take him

143
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:06,431
Damn

144
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,795
You're fired, get out of here

145
00:20:37,502 --> 00:20:39,368
<i>A.</i>

146
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:42,541
What? You've broken this

147
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,266
You're lucky you don't have to pay for it

148
00:20:46,812 --> 00:20:50,180
Boss, I got robbed by some hooligans

149
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:54,813
I think you're the hooligan, get lost

150
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,690
Line up...

151
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,001
Two tickets

152
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,204
There's only one left

153
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:13,963
I want two tickets

154
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:14,900
Only one left

155
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:15,869
Two tickets

156
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:17,633
-No
-Move over

157
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,069
I want one

158
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,910
Sorry, it's all sold

159
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:36,587
Two tickets...

160
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:53,330
I've been telling you to be a call girl...

161
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,466
if only you'd listen

162
00:22:56,675 --> 00:22:57,267
It'll fetch you money to cure your father

163
00:22:57,476 --> 00:22:58,568
And then he won't die, will he?

164
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,778
Hey, you still owe the rent

165
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:07,678
Hey, I'm talking to you!

166
00:23:08,453 --> 00:23:10,945
You'll have to pay the rent...

167
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:12,052
when will you pay it?

168
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:13,281
How much does she owe you?

169
00:23:13,492 --> 00:23:14,254
One month's rent

170
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,388
Forty dollars

171
00:23:17,629 --> 00:23:19,893
Just because your father's dead

172
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:20,587
You still have to pay the rent or...

173
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:21,322
I'll call the police

174
00:23:21,533 --> 00:23:23,900
Fine, here are the forty dollars

175
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:34,746
Xiujuan, you better come with me

176
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:44,255
I'll take you to my boss, you are pretty

177
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:46,117
You can start earning money right away

178
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:48,083
For the time being you can stay with me

179
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:50,595
You look like a country pumpkin though

180
00:23:50,796 --> 00:23:52,890
I'll help you to dress up,
you'll be popular

181
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:54,891
What do you think?

182
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:18,377
You want to tell me something?

183
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:38,928
Xiaobiao, you're my pal

184
00:25:47,612 --> 00:25:49,580
You want to comfort me, right?

185
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:54,649
You're so nice, do you know whom I fancy?

186
00:25:54,953 --> 00:25:56,478
You wouldn't know

187
00:25:57,622 --> 00:26:00,057
Xiujuan, who sells toys over at the street

188
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:05,119
Asked her out for a movie tonight

189
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,396
She didn't show up

190
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,668
I trashed her stand in a rage

191
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,870
It's my fault, she's very nice to me

192
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:15,130
I shouldn't have done it

193
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,234
You know exactly what's on my mind

194
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,005
I love being friends with you

195
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:36,485
They all bully me, only you're kind

196
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:42,025
This is the best season to savour cobras

197
00:26:56,915 --> 00:26:57,677
Zhong

198
00:26:57,882 --> 00:26:58,781
Yes, boss

199
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:02,577
What can I help you with?

200
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,051
What's the matter with you?

201
00:27:05,256 --> 00:27:07,088
Are you
stealing my snakes and selling them?

202
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,455
I wouldn't dare do something like that!

203
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:15,197
Get to work

204
00:27:28,847 --> 00:27:30,178
What's going on?

205
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:34,711
The cages look okay, what happened?

206
00:30:21,953 --> 00:30:23,114
Are you looking for company?

207
00:30:24,122 --> 00:30:24,418
I want Jin yan

208
00:30:24,622 --> 00:30:26,112

00:31:03,194 --> 00:31:05,253
Hurry and take your clothes off

212
00:31:55,213 --> 00:31:56,271
What's with you?

213
00:31:58,483 --> 00:32:00,952
I want another go

214
00:32:03,121 --> 00:32:05,112
I don't think so

215
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,726
It's your problem, I'll charge you anyway

216
00:32:13,731 --> 00:32:14,960
You...

217
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:17,491
Are you kidding? You've had your fun

218
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:20,965
Pay up now

219
00:32:27,145 --> 00:32:29,807
Have a look at yourself, what a loser!

220
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:41,849
Hey the boy might have some money

221
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:45,753
Go...

222
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:08,711
Search him

223
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:12,755
Search him, and beat him up

224
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:42,851
Damn, you loser

225
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:44,783
See if you dare to mess with me now

226
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:05,838
Oh, it's a snake!

227
00:34:06,244 --> 00:34:07,609
Help!

228
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:19,649
A cobra

229
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,924
Calm down

230
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:53,348
Bite him

231
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:08,005
Bite them all

232
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,922
Damn, it's only a string

233
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,834
Thank you so much

234
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:35,713
Bite him dead

235
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:51,198
Bite her

236
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:57,311
Bite her dead

237
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:52,387
I want more snakes, more...

238
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:57,640
Hurry

239
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:16,061
What the...!

240
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:17,324
Chen Zhihong

241
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:23,635
Chen Zhihong...

242
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:27,434
some nerve you've got!

243
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:30,746
How dare you steal from me?

244
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:33,542
Please, Mr. Zhou, the snakes are all here

245
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:34,717
Not one less

246
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:35,583
I beat you

247
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:38,255
I'll return them all to you, please

248
00:47:40,791 --> 00:47:41,952
I beg you

249
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:43,923
Please forgive me

250
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:45,556
I'll never do it again

251
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:47,696
I beg you

252
00:47:48,131 --> 00:47:50,065
Damn

253
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:51,826
rll kill you

254
00:47:52,135 --> 00:47:53,261
Damn it

255
00:49:08,845 --> 00:49:10,142
The brat is peeping, I'll beat you up

256
00:49:10,347 --> 00:49:11,508
Help!

257
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:13,506
Where you go?

258
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:15,612
Help!

259
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:19,312
Hold him, the scissors

260
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,687
Man, wake up

261
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:16,027
He drinks like you and me

262
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:20,604
Come on

263
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:24,169
Easy

264
00:53:57,934 --> 00:54:02,428
I didn't harm you...

265
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:49,909
Good afternoon

266
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,521
This is the News at noon

267
00:54:52,722 --> 00:54:55,384
Two victims
were found dead in a snake shop...

268
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:57,526
last night.
One of them was the shop's owner,

269
00:54:57,727 --> 00:54:59,354
the other was a body of a young woman.

270
00:54:59,996 --> 00:55:01,259
According to the police,
it's possible that...

271
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:04,331
the deaths were
due to venomous snake bites

272
00:55:04,534 --> 00:55:06,662
Their bodies were dark purple in color

273
00:55:07,137 --> 00:55:08,536
The male victim
is identified as Zhou Fucheng

274
00:55:08,738 --> 00:55:09,728
Good afternoon, sir

275
00:55:09,939 --> 00:55:10,906
Zhou was the owner of the snake shop

276
00:55:11,107 --> 00:55:12,632
He was around forty years old

277
00:55:12,842 --> 00:55:14,469
The dead woman
is identified as Zhang Jin yan

278
00:55:14,678 --> 00:55:15,509
Twenty two years old

279
00:55:15,712 --> 00:55:18,113
She's a prostitute in the neighbourhood

280
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:19,874
According to the police...

281
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:21,915
there are three more bodies...

282
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:23,916
with snake bites found at the alley...

283
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:25,849
behind Temple Street

284
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:29,324
The police warns that a large number...

285
00:55:29,526 --> 00:55:31,051
of poisonous snakes have escaped.

286
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:33,127
Citizens are
requested to keep a watchful eye

287
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:34,760
And report to the police when they spot...

288
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:36,762
the snakes or call the hot line of the...

289
00:55:36,966 --> 00:55:39,867
Snakes & Pest Control Unit

290
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:42,462
Jeez, you scared the hell out of me!

291
00:55:45,375 --> 00:55:47,309
This is the weather report

292
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:49,243
It's a fine day in Hong Kong today

293
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:50,379
with plenty of sunshine

294
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:53,049
The highest temperature is 25.1 degrees

295
00:55:53,249 --> 00:55:55,274
And the lowest is 17.9 degrees

296
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:58,619
The winds will be northerly

297
00:55:59,422 --> 00:56:01,117
Where's that virgin you promised?

298
00:56:02,092 --> 00:56:04,424
Of course I've got everything prepared

299
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:06,496
Come, I'll show you

300
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:29,976
Fangfang, I can't stand it

301
00:56:30,186 --> 00:56:31,847
Please can I borrow your place now?

302
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:32,886
No

303
00:56:33,089 --> 00:56:34,079
Why not?

304
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:35,823
What did you promise me?

305
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:37,288
You'll have it
once the transaction's completed

306
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:38,984
Come on and get dressed

307
00:56:39,195 --> 00:56:40,026
Half an hour and I'll be set

308
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,493
No, not today

309
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:43,462
Why not? You have my word, I'll reward you

310
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:44,633
It's not time yet

311
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:48,037
See, won't this do?

312
00:56:49,639 --> 00:56:51,971
When the time comes...

313
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:53,199
I'll give you a call

314
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:56,072
Just half an hour...
-Now you leave first

315
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:58,039
You must call me, okay

316
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:06,150
When did the snakes disappear?

317
00:57:07,023 --> 00:57:10,425
Not sure. We had many customers yesterday

318
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:14,257
They were all here

319
00:57:14,564 --> 00:57:15,759
But they're all gone this morning

320
00:57:16,866 --> 00:57:18,595
Weren't the cages shut properly?

321
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:21,533
But after all
they're snakes, it's hard to say

322
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:24,234
Old Wu, he lives next door

323
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:29,671
Did you hear any strange noises...

324
00:57:29,879 --> 00:57:31,779
coming from the shop last night?

325
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:38,081
No,
I was tired and slept the night through

326
00:57:39,189 --> 00:57:41,988
Be careful, there're many escaped snakes

327
00:57:42,192 --> 00:57:45,594
Go to a hospital if you get bitten

328
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:48,059
Let's go

329
00:58:00,109 --> 00:58:04,205
Zhihong, I saw Xiujuan last night

330
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:05,975
Xiujuan?

331
00:58:06,182 --> 00:58:07,581
If she wouldn't have called me...

332
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:09,183
I could not have recognized her

333
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:13,713
She looks really pretty when dressed up

334
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:19,628
She's turned into quite a woman; Too bad!

335
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:20,853
Stop it

336
00:58:21,798 --> 00:58:22,890
Are you alright?

337
00:58:24,100 --> 00:58:25,261
I'm fine

338
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:30,028
Forget about it

339
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:32,834
Those who have money can dance with her

340
00:58:33,042 --> 00:58:34,339
They can hold her as close as they want

341
00:58:34,544 --> 00:58:36,979
Sooner or later,
she'll become a prostitute

342
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:39,478
If there's a first time,
there'll be a second

343
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:40,478
Whoever has money can have a go

344
00:58:40,683 --> 00:58:41,707
No

345
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:22,590
Please stop

346
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:24,055
Why not?

347
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:25,853
You can at least dance with me

348
00:59:28,031 --> 00:59:29,396
Mr. Hu, please

349
00:59:29,766 --> 00:59:31,325
Alright,
if you agree to dine out with me...

350
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:32,524
I promise to be a gentleman

351
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,100
We can ask Fang to come along

352
00:59:34,437 --> 00:59:36,269
What else are you scared of?

353
00:59:45,048 --> 00:59:46,140
Cheers

354
00:59:48,918 --> 00:59:50,113
Bottoms up

355
00:59:59,128 --> 01:00:02,359
Another glass, the last one

356
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:03,398
Had enough!

357
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,364
Don't worry, I'll be here

358
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:07,525
One last glass

359
01:00:07,737 --> 01:00:08,727
Last one

360
01:00:09,405 --> 01:00:13,239
-rll drink with you, cheers
-Cheers

361
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:25,553
I'm just going to the washroom

362
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:38,060
Fangfang, it's got to be tonight

363
01:00:38,368 --> 01:00:39,767
Can I borrow your place?

364
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:41,498
No

365
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:45,504
Alright, go check on her

366
01:01:56,112 --> 01:01:57,705
ain't drunk

367
01:02:10,393 --> 01:02:12,623
Where are you taking her?

368
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:18,000
What a shock!

369
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:21,432
Hey, where's my reward?

370
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:23,438
Here it is

371
01:02:27,744 --> 01:02:28,643
Thanks

372
01:02:39,589 --> 01:02:39,953
Taxi

373
01:02:57,907 --> 01:03:02,140
Let go of me

374
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:02,877
Tell me right now

375
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:05,013
Where did he take Xiujuan to?

376
01:05:22,685 --> 01:05:23,652
Let me go

377
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:24,479
Tell me now

378
01:05:24,687 --> 01:05:26,382
Where did he take Xiujuan to?

379
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,922
It's none of your business

380
01:05:30,126 --> 01:05:31,252
Let go or I'll scream

381
01:05:57,386 --> 01:05:58,285
Where are they?

382
01:05:58,487 --> 01:06:02,890
Let go of me

383
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:08,721
Let go

384
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:14,168
Love Motel in Kowloon Tong;

385
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:17,203
now let go

386
01:06:26,749 --> 01:06:34,749
No, no, no

387
01:08:16,725 --> 01:08:21,492
Hit me! Hit me...

388
01:08:21,697 --> 01:08:25,759
Please, hit me

389
01:16:47,369 --> 01:16:49,167
Forget about it

390
01:16:49,371 --> 01:16:50,133
What can you do?

391
01:16:50,339 --> 01:16:50,965
You're totally broke

392
01:16:51,173 --> 01:16:53,107
Those who have money can dance with her

393
01:16:53,308 --> 01:16:54,639
They can hold her as close as they want

394
01:16:55,010 --> 01:16:56,500
Sooner or later,

395
01:16:56,712 --> 01:16:57,838
she'll become a prostitute

396
01:16:58,046 --> 01:16:59,639
If there's a first time,
there'll be a second

397
01:16:59,848 --> 01:17:01,839
Whoever has money can have a go

398
01:17:02,384 --> 01:17:08,756
No, No, No

399
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:20,762
Xiujuan, whoever has money can touch you

400
01:17:21,570 --> 01:17:25,370
I think you'd be better off dead

401
01:17:29,444 --> 01:17:35,349
Don't worry, it won't hurt a bit

402
01:17:35,984 --> 01:17:39,511
It's better than living as a prostitute

403
01:18:18,927 --> 01:18:24,388
Xiujuan, I promise you

404
01:18:24,599 --> 01:18:27,034
I'll take revenge for you

405
01:19:33,702 --> 01:19:35,397
Moving away?

406
01:20:54,382 --> 01:20:58,944
Xiaobiao, kill for Xiujuan

407
01:25:07,469 --> 01:25:08,766
Hu Baochun

408
01:25:09,137 --> 01:25:12,630
You ruined Xiujuan,
lucky that I've saved her

409
01:25:12,841 --> 01:25:16,209
from her despair

410
01:25:16,978 --> 01:25:19,003
You're more wicked than venom

411
01:26:21,376 --> 01:26:22,400
I don't think he's in

412
01:26:22,744 --> 01:26:23,711
Look again

413
01:26:24,145 --> 01:26:25,476
He's not inside

414
01:26:26,247 --> 01:26:27,976
He took a lot of stuff with him

415
01:26:29,384 --> 01:26:30,408
Who are you?

416
01:26:30,752 --> 01:26:32,686
I'm the hairdresser next door

417
01:27:16,598 --> 01:27:17,827
He might have really moved

418
01:27:18,199 --> 01:27:19,860
Yes, I saw him last night

419
01:27:20,068 --> 01:27:21,968
He took a lot of stuff with him

420
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:24,070
What evidence have you got
that he's moved?

421
01:27:25,306 --> 01:27:26,467
Please come with me

422
01:28:22,764 --> 01:28:23,731
-Let's go
-OK

423
01:29:30,264 --> 01:29:31,288
Xiaobiao

424
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:36,503
Please forgive me, I have no choice

425
01:29:36,904 --> 01:29:38,998
I just
don't want the police to capture you

426
01:29:39,640 --> 01:29:40,903
And they'll torture you

427
01:29:42,844 --> 01:29:46,246
Goodbye, my friends

428
01:31:52,473 --> 01:31:56,034
Why've you come back, Xiaobiao?

429
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:57,569
Come here

430
01:31:58,279 --> 01:32:00,373
You bit me

431
01:32:01,148 --> 01:32:03,515
Xiaobiao, you bit me

432
01:32:12,927 --> 01:32:14,827
Look at your burn marks

433
01:32:15,830 --> 01:32:23,635
Poor thing, it's my fault...

434
01:32:30,011 --> 01:32:33,037
Forgive me then, come on...

435
01:33:48,923 --> 01:33:54,521
Help ! Help!
