doing here, Mr. Pu?

90
00:09:06,822 --> 00:09:08,738
當然是為了三百萬兩黃金
For the three million taels of gold.

91
00:09:08,863 --> 00:09:10,113
誰有那麼多黃金？
Who had so much gold?

92
00:09:10,113 --> 00:09:11,613
富貴神仙呂三爺
Lu San, of course.

93
00:09:12,113 --> 00:09:14,405
由鐵膽神槍鐵翼押送

我作接應
to be delivered to me.

95
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,322

But it was stolen after all.

96
00:09:19,322 --> 00:09:21,613
呂三爺的黃金也有人敢搶？
Who dared steal Lord Lu San’s gold?

97
00:09:21,613 --> 00:09:24,197
有人敢殺呂三的獨生兒子
Someone killed his only son.

98
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:27,155
就有人敢搶呂三的三百萬兩黃金
I don’t believe nobody steals from him.

99
00:09:27,155 --> 00:09:29,155
對，貓盜就敢搶
Yeah, like Cat Bandit.

100
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,238
何以見得是貓盜所為？
How do you know it was Cat Bandit?

101
00:09:33,822 --> 00:09:36,113
鐵翼手下屍體旁邊撿到的
Found by the dead body of Tieh Yi’s man.

102
00:09:36,863 --> 00:09:38,072
這就是證據
It’s the evidence.

103
00:09:38,072 --> 00:09:41,447
聽說貓盜作案從來不留線索
I heard Cat Bandit never leaves anything.

104
00:09:43,863 --> 00:09:45,572
這當然是故意栽贓
Someone tried to plant it on him.

105
00:09:46,072 --> 00:09:46,905
卜大公子
Mr. Pu,

106
00:09:47,363 --> 00:09:48,405
這片沙漠裡
the desert

107
00:09:48,405 --> 00:09:50,613
已經全是呂三爺的天下
belongs to Lord Lu San.

108
00:09:50,613 --> 00:09:54,030
絕沒有人能運走三百萬兩黃金
Nobody can get the gold out of here.

109
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:55,697
別忘了我是卜鷹
Remember, I’m Pu Ying.

110
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,322
黃金已在我手裡
If I’ve got the gold,

111
00:10:23,947 --> 00:10:25,530
我就有辦法運出去
I can get it out of here.

112
00:10:26,363 --> 00:10:28,655
可惜黃金不在我手裡
But I haven’t got it.

113
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:31,863
我早晚會找到證據
I’ll prove it eventually.

114
00:10:31,863 --> 00:10:32,947
走
Let’s go.

115
00:10:51,822 --> 00:10:53,738
想不到我居然還有朋友
Never knew I'd have a friend

116
00:10:53,738 --> 00:10:54,988
不想讓我死
who doesn’t want me to die.

117
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,905
要命的小方也有朋友
The damned Fang has a friend?

118
00:10:57,905 --> 00:11:00,530
你知道我小方哪一點要命？
Do you know why I’m damned?

119
00:11:01,447 --> 00:11:03,530
你脾氣怪得要命
You’re damned eccentric.

120
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:05,488
有時好得要命
Sometimes you’re damned nice.

121
00:11:05,488 --> 00:11:07,780
有時你要別人的命
Sometimes you kill people.

122
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:10,238
有時候人家要你的命
Sometimes people want to kill you.

123
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,238
這一次…
But this time,

124
00:11:13,947 --> 00:11:16,655
你要了呂三獨生兒子的命
you killed Lu San’s only son.

125
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:17,822
不錯
You’re right.

126
00:11:17,822 --> 00:11:20,613
你知道呂三爺是不會放過你的
You know Lu San will never let you go.

127
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:21,530
他有的是錢
He’s rich as hell.

128
00:11:22,947 --> 00:11:25,322
而世界上偏多為錢賣命的人
And money really talks.

129
00:11:27,738 --> 00:11:29,322
你為什麼要殺他兒子？
Why did you kill his son?

130
00:11:29,322 --> 00:11:30,863
因為他該死
Because he deserved to die.

131
00:11:30,863 --> 00:11:33,363
現在至少有十三個人來要你的命
At least 13 people are trying to kill you.

132
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,405
只有十三個？
Only 13?

133
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:37,405
我以為不止
I thought there’s more.

134
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:39,322
你要小心其中兩個
Beware of two of them.

135
00:11:39,863 --> 00:11:41,947
一個是獨孤痴，一個是水銀
Tu-ku Chih and Shui Yin.

136
00:11:41,947 --> 00:11:43,822
獨孤痴是個劍客
Tu-ku Chih is a swordsman

137
00:11:43,822 --> 00:11:45,488
而水銀是個女人
while Shui Yin is a woman.

138
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,072
我走了
I’ve got to go.

139
00:11:49,405 --> 00:11:52,447
等你死了，我會來拿這把劍
I’ll get the sword when you die.

140
00:14:55,655 --> 00:14:59,530
中你魔劍，沒有立即斃命
You’ve hurt me, but I’m still alive.

141
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:02,363
不是你手下留情，就是我命大
Either you’ve shown mercy or I’m lucky.

142
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:06,822
在沙漠裡水可以救命
Water saves our lives in a desert.

143
00:15:10,905 --> 00:15:12,905
這點水救不了我們的
There’s not enough water to save us.

144
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:14,822
不夠我們走出沙漠
Not enough for us to get out of the desert.

145
00:15:15,905 --> 00:15:17,780
只有給我的朋友喝
But enough for my friend,

146
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,697
他可以帶著我們走出沙漠
who can take us out of the desert.

147
00:15:20,488 --> 00:15:21,780
你的朋友？
Your friend?

148
00:15:23,238 --> 00:15:24,655
牠就是我的朋友
That’s my friend.

149
00:15:26,822 --> 00:15:29,238
牠始終跟著我，生死與共
We’ve been together forever.

150
00:15:30,613 --> 00:15:32,488
像這樣的朋友，你有幾個？
Do you have a friend like that?

151
00:15:32,488 --> 00:15:33,655
半個也沒有
Not even one.

152
00:15:34,572 --> 00:15:36,280
牠是一匹千里良駒
That’s a great horse.

153
00:15:37,030 --> 00:15:38,447
有了這袋水
With the water,

154
00:15:38,447 --> 00:15:40,905
就可以馱著我們走出沙漠
it’ll carry us out of the desert.

155
00:15:40,905 --> 00:15:42,655
你知道我是來殺你的嗎？
Do you know I’m here to kill you?

156
00:15:43,655 --> 00:15:44,488
我知道
Yes, I do.

157
00:15:44,488 --> 00:15:47,863
我還知道你是兩大頂尖殺手之一
And I know you’re one of the top killers,

158
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:49,072
水銀
Shui Yin.

159
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,113
還是留著你自己喝吧
You can keep the water.

160
00:15:58,572 --> 00:16:00,988
你是不會帶水給你的敵人喝的
You’ll never give water to your enemy.

161
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:06,280
可是你也不會不帶水給自己喝
But you must have water for yourself.

162
00:16:27,072 --> 00:16:29,322
這叫聰明反被聰明誤
You’re too smart for your own good.

163
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,488
你…你…
You...

164
00:16:33,238 --> 00:16:35,488
我還是把你估得太低
I’ve underestimated you.

165
00:16:36,738 --> 00:16:40,155
原來這個袋子裡才是有毒的
So it’s the poisoned water.

166
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,072
不是毒
Not poisoned

167
00:16:42,905 --> 00:16:44,988
因為我們還不想讓你死
because we don’t want you to die now.

168
00:16:47,738 --> 00:16:49,030
這是地靈水
It’s Land Spirit water,

169
00:16:49,697 --> 00:16:51,113
味道跟水一樣
which tastes like water

170
00:16:51,572 --> 00:16:54,030
喝下去會全身麻痺
but paralyzes you all over

171
00:16:54,405 --> 00:16:56,530
接著奇渴無比
and makes you more thirsty than ever.

172
00:17:16,155 --> 00:17:18,405
水…水…
Water...

173
00:17:18,863 --> 00:17:20,321
給我水喝
I want water.

174
00:17:22,905 --> 00:17:24,696
這水髒了，不能喝的
It’s dirty water. You can’t drink it.

175
00:17:43,488 --> 00:17:46,780
（呂）
"Lu"

176
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,947
想不到是你救了我
Never thought you’d save me.

177
00:17:48,947 --> 00:17:50,280
我救你一時
I’ve saved your life,

178
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,447
要活下去還得靠你自己
but it’s up to yourself to survive.

179
00:17:52,447 --> 00:17:54,238
你殺了呂三爺的獨生兒子
You killed Lu San’s only son.

180
00:17:54,238 --> 00:17:55,822
本來非償命不可
You had to die for it.

181
00:17:55,822 --> 00:17:56,988
那現在呢？
And now?

182
00:17:56,988 --> 00:17:58,197
如果你能幫我們找回
If you’ll retrieve the stolen

183
00:17:58,197 --> 00:18:00,155
三百萬兩被劫黃金
three million taels of gold,

184
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:04,197
我保證呂三爺不再找你報仇
I promise that Lu San will let you go.

185
00:18:04,197 --> 00:18:05,613
公平交易
It’s a fair deal.

186
00:18:05,613 --> 00:18:07,155
太公平了
Very fair.

187
00:18:08,613 --> 00:18:11,113
你們以為黃金一定是卜鷹劫走的
You thought Pu Ying stole the gold.

188
00:18:11,822 --> 00:18:13,322
我正好認識他
I know him well.

189
00:18:13,322 --> 00:18:15,405
可以替你們去辦這件事情
I can talk to him on your behalf.

190
00:18:15,405 --> 00:18:16,197
是的
Yeah.

191
00:18:17,322 --> 00:18:18,822
如果我不答應
If I don’t say yes,

192
00:18:19,363 --> 00:18:21,280
就算你們不殺我
even if you don’t kill me,

193
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,280
我也會活活地渴死在沙漠裡
I’ll die of thirst in the desert.

194
00:18:26,655 --> 00:18:28,530
那滋味不好受喔
It’s not an easy way to die.

195
00:18:29,155 --> 00:18:31,738
哦，我是非答應不可了
So I have to say yes?

196
00:18:32,697 --> 00:18:34,113
你答應了？
Is that a yes?

197
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,405
不答應
No.

198
00:18:39,488 --> 00:18:40,697
為什麼？
Why not?

199
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:42,822
因為我不高興
Because I’m not happy.

200
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,488
讓他走
Let him go.

201
00:18:44,905 --> 00:18:45,988
還他的劍
Return his sword.

202
00:18:46,488 --> 00:18:50,863
給他一壺酒、一袋肉、一壺水
Give him some wine, meat and water.

203
00:18:52,238 --> 00:18:54,947
還有…他的衣服
And... his clothes.

204
00:18:57,238 --> 00:18:59,488
衛天鵬，你不聾
You’re not deaf, Wei Tien-peng.

205
00:18:59,613 --> 00:19:01,697
你應該聽得見我在說什麼
You heard what I said.

206
00:19:06,863 --> 00:19:08,530
卜鷹還在這個附近
Pu Ying is still around.

207
00:19:09,405 --> 00:19:11,113
給你的食物和水
The food and water are enough

208
00:19:11,822 --> 00:19:13,863
能維持三天
to sustain you for three days.

209
00:19:13,863 --> 00:19:17,113
你找到卜鷹之後，可以再來
You can come back when you find Pu Ying.

210
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:19,780
再來？再來幹什麼？
Come back? For what?

211
00:19:21,113 --> 00:19:22,988
你可以帶點消息來交換
Bring us some information for an exchange.

212
00:19:24,488 --> 00:19:25,905
如果我真有消息帶來
If I’ll bring you information,

213
00:19:26,363 --> 00:19:29,238
來交換的也許就不只是食物跟水
what I want won’t be just food and water.

214
00:19:29,238 --> 00:19:30,072
可以
Okay.

215
00:19:30,572 --> 00:19:32,447
隨便你交換什麼都行
Whatever you want.

216
00:19:37,572 --> 00:19:39,697
這個女人實在是很好看的女人
That is a really good-looking woman.

217
00:19:44,780 --> 00:19:50,697
#兒須成名
#You need fame

218
00:19:50,697 --> 00:19:55,905
#酒須醉
#And to get drunk

219
00:19:55,905 --> 00:20:00,530
#酒後傾訴
#When you’re drunk

220
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:10,238
#是真言
#You tell the truth

221
00:20:10,488 --> 00:20:11,655
我知道你會來
I knew you’d come.

222
00:20:14,447 --> 00:20:18,155
看起來和我第一次看見你的時候
You look completely different

223
00:20:18,738 --> 00:20:20,447
風光大不相同
from when I first saw you.

224
00:20:22,363 --> 00:20:23,655
有什麼不同？
How so?

225
00:20:24,405 --> 00:20:27,363
現在你看起來就像個暴發戶
You look like an upstart.

226
00:20:27,363 --> 00:20:28,530
我只是先預支了
I’ve advanced a part

227
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:31,238
我將要帶回去情報的一部分代價
of the information I’ll take back with me.

228
00:20:31,613 --> 00:20:33,405
你想不想得到這個情報？
Do you want the information?

229
00:20:33,405 --> 00:20:34,822
我非得到不可
I have to get it.

230
00:20:38,905 --> 00:20:39,738
憑什麼？
With what?

231
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,613
本來可以憑我的劍
With my sword supposedly,

232
00:20:41,613 --> 00:20:43,738
但是現在我還不想用它
but I don’t want to use it now

233
00:20:43,738 --> 00:20:45,447
因為擁有這個情報的人
because I don’t know if I can defeat

234
00:20:45,447 --> 00:20:47,697
劍法也許不在我之下
the man who owns the information.

235
00:20:49,697 --> 00:20:51,155
你很聰明
You’re smart.

236
00:20:52,155 --> 00:20:54,780
可惜聰明的人往往都不會長命
But smart guys don’t live long

237
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:57,322
因為三天以後
because in three days,

238
00:20:58,363 --> 00:21:00,113
我會來替你收屍
I’ll bury you here.

239
00:21:03,738 --> 00:21:16,530
（呂）
"Lu"

240
00:21:32,863 --> 00:21:33,905
你是誰？
Who are you?

241
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,280
我叫波娃
I’m Powa.

242
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:39,947
我在等一個男人
I’m waiting for a man.

243
00:21:39,947 --> 00:21:41,030
等誰？
Who?

244
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:42,780
他是個很好的人
He’s a nice man.

245
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,947
他姓方
His name is Fang.

246
00:21:45,072 --> 00:21:46,113
你認識他？
You know him?

247
00:21:46,113 --> 00:21:47,405
不認得
No.

248
00:21:48,238 --> 00:21:49,363
是誰叫你來的？
Who asked you to come here?

249
00:21:50,447 --> 00:21:51,863
我的主人
My master.

250
00:21:52,738 --> 00:21:54,155
你的主人是誰？
Who’s your master?

251
00:21:55,988 --> 00:21:57,530
他也是個男人
He’s also a man,

252
00:21:57,738 --> 00:22:00,613
世上最威武強壯的男人
the strongest man in the world.

253
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:04,405
他像天空上的一隻鷹
He’s like an eagle in the sky.

254
00:22:04,405 --> 00:22:05,447
卜鷹？
Pu Ying?

255
00:22:07,697 --> 00:22:08,780
卜鷹
Pu Ying...

256
00:22:09,988 --> 00:22:12,697
他逼走衛天鵬跟水銀
He drove off Wei Tien-peng and Shui Yin.

257
00:22:13,697 --> 00:22:15,238
他為什麼要這麼做？
Why did he do that?

258
00:22:18,863 --> 00:22:21,280
你一定就是我在等的人
You must be the man I’ve been waiting for.

259
00:22:25,113 --> 00:22:26,488
你是個好人
You’re a nice man.

260
00:22:26,863 --> 00:22:29,113
一點都沒有欺負我
You don’t take advantage of me.

261
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:39,780
我看得出來你需要什麼
I know what you need.

262
00:22:40,363 --> 00:22:43,197
你要的，我都可以給你
I can give you whatever you want.

263
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,905
求求你不要拋下我
Please don’t leave me.

264
00:22:48,447 --> 00:22:52,030
這是我第一次心甘情願的給一個男人
It’s the first time//I’m giving myself to a man willingly.

265
00:22:59,863 --> 00:23:01,030
波娃這兩個字
What does

266
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,822
是不是有什麼特別的意義？
your name “Powa” mean?

267
00:23:05,072 --> 00:23:06,572
這是藏語
It’s Tibetan.

268
00:23:07,238 --> 00:23:09,822
波娃的意思就是雪
“Powa” means “snow”.

269
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:12,155
雪，多麼純潔
Snow? It’s pure and innocent.

270
00:23:12,947 --> 00:23:16,155
你的名字就像你的人一樣
You’re as beautiful as your name suggests.

271
00:23:46,655 --> 00:23:48,197
你的主人不是卜鷹
Your master isn’t Pu Ying.

272
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,072
是她
It’s her.

273
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,363
我敢打賭
I bet that

274
00:23:56,363 --> 00:23:57,863
直到現在你一定還不相信
you would never believe

275
00:23:57,863 --> 00:23:59,488
她會是這樣的女人
she’d do that to you.

276
00:24:01,363 --> 00:24:04,363
衛天鵬想要你替他找回黃金
Wei Tien-peng wants you//to retrieve the stolen gold

277
00:24:04,363 --> 00:24:06,280
我卻只想要你的命
while I want to kill you.

278
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:14,197
我敢打賭這次絕對沒有人來救你
I bet nobody will save you this time.

279
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:16,738
你賭什麼？
What do you bet?

280
00:24:16,738 --> 00:24:17,947
賭你的命
Your life.

281
00:24:19,238 --> 00:24:21,072
卜大公子又來管閒事
Mr. Pu never learns//to mind his own business.

282
00:24:31,572 --> 00:24:33,363
她竟然不用回頭看
She didn’t turn back

283
00:24:33,363 --> 00:24:34,655
就知道是你
to know that it’s you.

284
00:24:35,155 --> 00:24:37,488
還好你沒有跟她打賭
I’m glad you didn’t make the bet,

285
00:24:37,488 --> 00:24:38,655
不然你就輸了
or you would lose.

286
00:24:38,655 --> 00:24:39,947
為什麼？
Why?

287
00:24:39,947 --> 00:24:41,405
她說的不錯
She was right.

288
00:24:41,405 --> 00:24:43,655
這一次的確沒有人要來救你
Nobody would save you this time.

289
00:24:44,155 --> 00:24:46,072
你不是來救我的？
You’re not here to save me?

290
00:24:46,072 --> 00:24:48,738
我只是來要你身上這五個牛皮帶
No. I just want these five belts.

291
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,905
碰巧我正好用得著
I happen to need them.

292
00:24:52,905 --> 00:24:54,822
我要把它送給一個人
I’m giving them to someone.

293
00:24:56,613 --> 00:24:57,822
送給誰？
Who?

294
00:24:58,072 --> 00:24:59,613
一個自己要上吊的人
Someone who wants to hang himself.

295
00:24:59,947 --> 00:25:01,155
你的劍呢？
Where’s your sword?

296
00:25:01,655 --> 00:25:02,822
我不知道
I don’t know.

297
00:25:06,655 --> 00:25:08,447
你不想要回你的劍嗎？
Don’t you want your sword back?

298
00:25:08,613 --> 00:25:09,905
我想
Yes, I do.

299
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,530
其實…
In fact...

300
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,197
你除了這個女人之外什麼也不想要
you don’t want anything but this woman.

301
00:25:17,238 --> 00:25:20,780
我不怪你，我要照顧你
I don’t blame you. I’ll take care of you.

302
00:25:21,197 --> 00:25:23,947
絕不讓你受人的欺負擺佈
I won’t allow anyone to hurt you.

303
00:25:45,738 --> 00:25:47,113
那邊有個商隊
There’s a caravan.

304
00:26:07,488 --> 00:26:09,863
我姓方，在沙漠裡迷了路
I’m Fang, lost in the desert.

305
00:26:10,530 --> 00:26:12,405
沒有水，沒有銀兩
I have no water or money.

306
00:26:13,947 --> 00:26:15,072
沒有食糧
I have no food.

307
00:26:15,072 --> 00:26:17,822
麻煩你們，請你們帶我們走出沙漠
Please take us out of the desert.

308
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,947
你什麼都沒有
You have nothing.

309
00:26:20,405 --> 00:26:22,280
我為什麼要帶你走？
Why should I help you?

310
00:26:22,488 --> 00:26:24,655
因為我們是人
Because we’re human beings,

311
00:26:25,405 --> 00:26:26,655
你們也是人
and you are too.

312
00:26:26,863 --> 00:26:29,863
而且我可以保護你們商隊的安全
And I can protect your caravan.

313
00:26:35,363 --> 00:26:37,488
他姓方，我想用他
He’s Fang. I want to use him.

314
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:39,363
他有用？
He’s useful?

315
00:26:39,947 --> 00:26:41,113
有
Yeah.

316
00:26:42,447 --> 00:26:44,363
我來試試他有多大本事
Let’s see what he can do.

317
00:27:30,238 --> 00:27:31,738
你再試試我這一刀
Another round with my dagger.

318
00:27:54,613 --> 00:27:56,905
你要殺我，我就要殺你
I’ll kill you if you want to kill me.

319
00:27:57,488 --> 00:28:01,155
你殺不死我，就要死在我手裡
If you can’t kill me, you’re going to die.

320
00:28:01,155 --> 00:28:02,822
你說公不公平？
Is that fair?

321
00:28:04,988 --> 00:28:06,030
公平
Yeah.

322
00:28:10,905 --> 00:28:13,155
我不能殺你，因為你是勇士
I can’t kill you because you’re a warrior,

323
00:28:14,030 --> 00:28:15,322
不怕死的勇士
a fearless warrior.

324
00:28:20,322 --> 00:28:22,863
這是我們藏人最高的禮節
That’s a Tibetan’s highest etiquette

325
00:28:22,863 --> 00:28:24,613
表示對你的尊敬
to show our respect to you.

326
00:28:50,363 --> 00:28:51,863
你現在跟我們在一起
You’re with us now.

327
00:28:51,988 --> 00:28:54,738
就要跟別人一樣，每天輪班一次
You work in shifts like everyone else.

328
00:29:11,363 --> 00:29:13,238
要活下去就得做點事
You need to work to survive.

329
00:29:13,447 --> 00:29:15,113
勇士是不吃閒飯的
A warrior can’t be idle at all.

330
00:29:15,113 --> 00:29:17,238
看起來你們這裡勇士很多
It looks to me you have lots of warriors.

331
00:29:17,238 --> 00:29:18,613
馬沙也是勇士
Masa is also a warrior.

332
00:29:18,613 --> 00:29:20,947
恐怕以後永遠也看不到他了
I’m afraid you’ll never see him again.

333
00:29:20,947 --> 00:29:21,863
為什麼？
Why not?

334
00:29:21,863 --> 00:29:23,363
正中午的時候
At noon,

335
00:29:23,363 --> 00:29:25,280
他離開商隊去解手
he left the caravan to relieve himself

336
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:26,447
就沒有回來
but didn’t come back.

337
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,613
找馬沙的人回來了
They went looking for Masa.

338
00:29:31,613 --> 00:29:32,947
馬沙一定也回來了
I think they’re back with him.

339
00:29:46,197 --> 00:29:47,363
這就怪了
That’s weird.

340
00:29:49,988 --> 00:29:51,863
馬沙是個摔角的高手
Masa was a great wrestler.

341
00:29:53,155 --> 00:29:54,447
他竟然…
But he was...

342
00:29:54,447 --> 00:29:56,905
被人用摔角的手法活活掐死
wrestled and strangled to death.

343
00:30:00,113 --> 00:30:01,572
不好了，不好了
I have bad news!

344
00:30:01,988 --> 00:30:04,780
蛇鞭孫亮、金刀馬浩被殺了
Sun Liang and Ma Hao were killed!

345
00:30:21,988 --> 00:30:23,447
她是我姐姐
She’s my sister.

346
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:27,905
她？那個惡毒的女人
She? That wicked woman?

347
00:30:28,822 --> 00:30:31,113
我從小就跟她在一起
I’ve been with her since I was little.

348
00:30:31,488 --> 00:30:34,072
她要我做什麼，我就做什麼
I did whatever she asked me to do.

349
00:30:34,905 --> 00:30:36,405
你從不反抗？
You never said no?

350
00:30:37,822 --> 00:30:40,072
我從來沒有想過
I never thought about it.

351
00:30:43,197 --> 00:30:44,405
只要我活著
As long as I’m alive,

352
00:30:44,405 --> 00:30:46,197
就沒有人再能欺負你了
nobody is going to hurt you.

353
00:30:47,738 --> 00:30:49,238
你現在這麼說
You can say that to me,

354
00:30:49,863 --> 00:30:53,613
可是將來…說不定你會變
but in the future, maybe you’ll change.

355
00:30:54,488 --> 00:30:56,238
不管將來發生什麼事情
Whatever happens in the future,

356
00:30:56,238 --> 00:30:57,530
我都不會變
I’ll never change.

357
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,530
你一定要相信我
You have to trust me.

358
00:31:07,613 --> 00:31:09,238
我相信你
I trust you.

359
00:31:15,197 --> 00:31:16,863
啊！
Ah!

360
00:31:24,655 --> 00:31:26,197
這是一把寶劍
That’s a famous sword

361
00:31:27,072 --> 00:31:28,947
這把劍叫魔眼
named Devil’s Eye.

362
00:31:30,197 --> 00:31:31,905
殺人不沾血
It kills, never stained with blood.

363
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:36,363
只是魔眼發紅
But the devil’s eye reddens.

364
00:31:40,197 --> 00:31:42,155
你一定知道這柄劍的來歷
Do you know where the sword came from?

365
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,738
是的，太清楚了
Yes. I know it too well

366
00:31:44,947 --> 00:31:47,030
因為這柄劍是我的
because the sword is mine.

367
00:31:48,113 --> 00:31:51,530
唐麟身邊使用的是峨嵋仙猿劍
Tang Lin used the Hsien Yuan Sword from E’Mei.

368
00:31:52,655 --> 00:31:54,863
他出手快，而且準
He was fast and precise.

369
00:31:56,405 --> 00:31:57,905
能夠殺他的人
Whoever killed him

370
00:31:58,322 --> 00:32:02,280
是個出劍極快，武功高強的人
has to be faster and highly skilled.

371
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:05,113
不錯，我出劍的確不慢
You’re right. I’m fast indeed.

372
00:32:05,113 --> 00:32:07,405
要殺唐麟也不難
It’s easy for me to kill Tang Lin.

373
00:32:08,405 --> 00:32:10,988
只不過唐麟要是我殺的
But if I killed him,

374
00:32:11,988 --> 00:32:13,738
我就不會把劍留在他身上
I wouldn’t leave my sword with him.

375
00:32:13,738 --> 00:32:16,155
你的劍為什麼不在你手裡？
Why isn’t your sword with you?

376
00:32:16,822 --> 00:32:19,030
我已經很久沒有看到這柄劍
I haven’t seen the sword for a long time.

377
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:22,363
我相信你
I believe you.

378
00:32:23,072 --> 00:32:25,822
不過在兇手沒有查出來之前
But before we get the killer,

379
00:32:25,822 --> 00:32:27,655
你還是不能夠離開
you can’t leave.

380
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:30,363
這柄劍，你也不能帶走
And you can’t take the sword away.

381
00:32:31,072 --> 00:32:33,655
兇手沒有查出來之前
Before you get the killer,

382
00:32:33,655 --> 00:32:35,947
就算有人趕我走，我也不會走
I won’t leave even if you drive me off.

383
00:32:36,405 --> 00:32:38,072
班察巴那也不會讓你走
Bancha Bana won’t let you go.

384
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,530
班察巴那一回來
When Bancha Bana is back,

385
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,738
你也會跟他們一樣地死在沙漠上
you’ll die in the desert like they did.

386
00:32:43,613 --> 00:32:44,697
班察巴那是誰？
Who’s Bancha Bana?

387
00:32:45,822 --> 00:32:46,613
班察巴那！
Bancha Bana!

388
00:32:48,738 --> 00:32:50,197
班察巴那回來了
Bancha Bana is back!

389
00:32:50,197 --> 00:32:51,613
班察巴那回來了
Bancha Bana is back!

390
00:32:51,988 --> 00:32:53,155
班察巴那！
Bancha Bana!

391
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:31,947
這是你的劍？
Is this your sword?

392
00:33:32,447 --> 00:33:33,613
是的
Yes.

393
00:33:34,197 --> 00:33:35,613
你就是要命的小方？
You’re the damned Fang?

394
00:33:37,030 --> 00:33:38,072
是
Yes.

395
00:33:39,947 --> 00:33:41,738
這一次你要被別人要命
This time, your life is threatened.

396
00:33:42,863 --> 00:33:45,905
在這裡殺人，只有死
If you kill, you’ll have to die.

397
00:33:46,363 --> 00:33:48,322
這麼說我是不會死的
So I won’t die then.

398
00:33:49,155 --> 00:33:50,030
為什麼？
Why not?

399
00:33:50,030 --> 00:33:51,905
雖然我殺過很多人
Although I’ve killed lots of people,

400
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:54,738
這一次殺人，卻正巧不是我
it was not me who killed him.

401
00:33:55,947 --> 00:33:57,197
怎麼證明？
How do you prove that?

402
00:33:57,905 --> 00:33:59,322
要怎麼才能證明？
What should I do to prove that?

403
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:01,697
我們藏人都相信
We Tibetans believe that

404
00:34:01,697 --> 00:34:04,488
沒有罪的人是不會冤死的
an innocent person won’t die for nothing.

405
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,488
你先站到那邊去
Go and stand over there.

406
00:34:07,488 --> 00:34:08,947
我再開始數
Then I’ll count.

407
00:34:09,655 --> 00:34:13,613
數到五字，我才會出手
I’ll shoot the arrow when I count to five.

408
00:34:13,613 --> 00:34:15,447
等我數到五時
When I count to five,

409
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:19,072
以你的輕功，你可走出很遠
with your kung fu,//you’ll get far away from here.

410
00:34:19,863 --> 00:34:21,530
如果你真是無辜的話
If you’re really innocent,

411
00:34:22,488 --> 00:34:24,197
我的箭一定射不中你
my arrow will definitely miss you.

412
00:34:25,572 --> 00:34:27,905
百發百中的五花箭神
You hit the bull’s-eye almost every time.

413
00:34:27,905 --> 00:34:28,947
用這種法子
Trying to see

414
00:34:28,947 --> 00:34:31,447
證明一個人是不是無辜的
if someone is innocent in this way

415
00:34:31,447 --> 00:34:33,155
真是個好主意
is indeed a great idea.

416
00:34:33,155 --> 00:34:35,530
如果你不喜歡，還有一個法子
If you don’t like it, I have another idea.

417
00:34:36,572 --> 00:34:37,738
什麼法子？
What is that?

418
00:34:40,405 --> 00:34:42,363
你用這柄劍殺我
Kill me with the sword.

419
00:34:42,363 --> 00:34:44,447
只要你能將我殺死
If you can kill me,

420
00:34:44,447 --> 00:34:46,697
就不必再證明你是否無辜
you won’t have to prove your innocence.

421
00:34:47,738 --> 00:34:50,280
兩種方法，你選哪一種？
Which one do you choose?

422
00:35:15,155 --> 00:35:16,572
你可以開始數了
You can count now.

423
00:35:17,322 --> 00:35:20,613
最好數快一點，我最怕久等
Count faster. I don’t like to wait.

424
00:35:33,405 --> 00:35:39,738
1、2、3、4、5
One, two, three, four, five.

425
00:36:01,197 --> 00:36:02,655
你不怕死？
You’re not scared to die?

426
00:36:02,655 --> 00:36:04,530
我怕得要死
I’m scared of death.

427
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:05,822
你為什麼不躲？
Why didn’t you dodge?

428
00:36:06,697 --> 00:36:08,738
為了證明我是無辜的
I wanted to prove that I’m innocent.

429
00:36:15,697 --> 00:36:17,113
啊！
Ah!

430
00:36:17,780 --> 00:36:19,030
在駝子帳篷裡
From Hunchback’s tent.

431
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,405
駝子，是誰幹的？
Who did this to you, Hunchback?

432
00:36:24,405 --> 00:36:25,447
駝子
Hunchback?

433
00:36:27,113 --> 00:36:29,947
想不到…想不到…
I’ve never thought...

434
00:36:29,947 --> 00:36:31,113
想不到什麼？
Never thought what?

435
00:36:31,572 --> 00:36:36,613
想不到殺人的竟是他
Never thought he was the killer.

436
00:36:36,613 --> 00:36:37,697
他是誰？
Who is he?

437
00:36:37,697 --> 00:36:38,988
他…　-到哪去了？
He...　- Where is he?

438
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:40,030
他…他…
He...

439
00:36:51,572 --> 00:36:53,322
想不到殺人的竟是你
I’ve never thought you were the killer.

440
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,780
想不到是你
It was you.

441
00:37:02,030 --> 00:37:05,113
帶我走，求求你帶我走
Please. Get me out of here.

442
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,238
我一定會帶你走的
I’ll get you out of here.

443
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,655
誰也不能帶她走
Nobody gets her out of here.

444
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,155
為什麼？
Why not?

445
00:37:11,155 --> 00:37:14,655
我說過在這裡殺人的，只有死
I told you whoever kills here must die.

446
00:37:14,655 --> 00:37:16,905
你應該看得出來殺人的不是她
But it wasn’t she who killed him.

447
00:37:16,905 --> 00:37:19,697
那你一定看得出殺人的是誰了？
So you know who killed him?

448
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:22,322
是他
He did.

449
00:37:22,322 --> 00:37:23,947
你可知道這些貨物
Do you know which caravan

450
00:37:23,947 --> 00:37:25,405
是哪一個商隊的？
these goods belong to?

451
00:37:26,572 --> 00:37:28,280
這跟殺人有什麼關係？
What has it got to do with killing?

452
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:31,363
這些貨，這裡的人都是鷹記
These goods and men belong to Ying’s.

453
00:37:32,405 --> 00:37:33,488
飛鷹的鷹？
Pu Ying?

454
00:37:33,488 --> 00:37:34,155
對
Yes.

455
00:37:36,697 --> 00:37:38,363
你就是他們的東主
You’re their owner?

456
00:37:38,363 --> 00:37:40,822
就是他，連收容你、信任你
He is. He even asked us

457
00:37:41,363 --> 00:37:42,988
都是我們東主吩咐的
to take you in and trust you,

458
00:37:44,238 --> 00:37:47,322
否則你早已死在我的箭下
or I would’ve killed you with my arrows.

459
00:37:48,197 --> 00:37:51,155
你總不會相信他搜自己的貨物
You think he would search his goods

460
00:37:51,155 --> 00:37:52,613
殺自己的人吧
and kill his men?

461
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:55,655
誰也沒有看到殺人的是她
But nobody saw her kill him.

462
00:37:55,655 --> 00:37:58,155
可誰也不能證明她是無辜的
Nobody can prove her innocence either.

463
00:37:58,155 --> 00:37:59,947
你又要用那種方法來證明？
Are you going to prove it in that way?

464
00:37:59,947 --> 00:38:00,863
對
Yes.

465
00:38:01,697 --> 00:38:04,863
五花箭神的箭絕不會傷及無辜
The arrows will never hurt the innocent.

466
00:38:09,738 --> 00:38:11,322
你雖然說過
Although you said that

467
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:12,780
只要你活著
as long as you’re alive,

468
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:15,322
就不會讓別人來欺負我
you won’t allow anyone to hurt me,

469
00:38:15,322 --> 00:38:17,863
可是我早就知道這是做不到的
I know you can’t keep your promise.

470
00:38:18,613 --> 00:38:20,738
每件事都會改變
Everything changes.

471
00:38:20,738 --> 00:38:22,488
每個人都會變
Everybody changes.

472
00:38:22,488 --> 00:38:24,613
現在你可以忘記這些話
Just forget what you’ve said

473
00:38:24,613 --> 00:38:26,113
就讓他們殺了我
and let them kill me.

474
00:38:28,738 --> 00:38:30,072
讓她走
Let her go.

475
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,530
就這樣讓她走？
Just like her go like that?

476
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,738
當然不是
Of course not.

477
00:38:34,738 --> 00:38:38,488
還得給她一袋水、一袋食糧
Give her some water, food

478
00:38:38,488 --> 00:38:40,072
一匹最快的馬
and the fastest horse.

479
00:38:40,988 --> 00:38:43,155
我要她走得越快越好
I want her to leave as soon as possible.

480
00:38:47,988 --> 00:38:49,655
她走，你留下
She goes. You stay.

481
00:38:51,238 --> 00:38:52,322
這是條件？
Is that your condition?

482
00:38:52,322 --> 00:38:53,488
是
Yes.

483
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:56,988
你走吧
Just go.

484
00:38:56,988 --> 00:38:59,863
只要我不死，我一定會去找你
As long as I’m alive, I’ll find you.

485
00:39:00,405 --> 00:39:01,947
你也一定能夠找到我
And I believe you’ll find me.

486
00:39:18,072 --> 00:39:19,488
你既然肯放她走
You let her go.

487
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,072
為什麼要我留下？
Why do I have to stay?

488
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:27,530
你受傷了？
You’re hurt?

489
00:39:29,363 --> 00:39:31,155
只要是人都會受傷
Anybody could get hurt.

490
00:39:31,988 --> 00:39:33,488
可是江湖上都知道
But we all know that

491
00:39:33,488 --> 00:39:35,155
你是從來不敗的
you’ve never been defeated.

492
00:39:35,155 --> 00:39:37,322
每一件事都有第一次
There’s always a first time//for everything.

493
00:39:38,613 --> 00:39:40,030
你已經跟他交過手了？
You’ve already fought with him?

494
00:39:44,947 --> 00:39:46,947
我在衛天鵬的帳篷裡見過他
I saw him in Wei Tien-peng’s tent.

495
00:39:47,947 --> 00:39:50,447
無名無姓，像個孤魂野鬼
He has no name, like a ghost.

496
00:39:51,238 --> 00:39:53,030
難怪駝子也會遭到暗算
No wonder Hunchback got assassinated.

497
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:54,988
當代七大劍客當中
None of the top seven swordsmen

498
00:39:56,363 --> 00:39:58,613
也沒有人能接得住他這一劍
can take a blow from him.

499
00:40:00,155 --> 00:40:04,572
必殺、必勝、必死的絕劍
He holds the invincible sword.

500
00:40:04,655 --> 00:40:08,072
可是…你還沒有死
But you’re still alive.

501
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:11,363
你怎麼曉得，我留下你…
Who knows? I asked you to stay...

502
00:40:12,322 --> 00:40:14,238
也許我要讓你等我死
Maybe I want you to watch me die.

503
00:40:15,155 --> 00:40:16,905
因為我也曾經等你死
I did that to you once after all.

504
00:40:22,905 --> 00:40:25,613
我等你，不是等你死
I’m not waiting to watch you die,

505
00:40:26,697 --> 00:40:28,072
而是等你站起來
but for you to stand up.

506
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:36,447
有一件事我要告訴你
I need to tell you something.

507
00:40:37,613 --> 00:40:39,072
那個無名劍客
The unknown swordsman

508
00:40:40,113 --> 00:40:42,197
並不是真的沒有名字
doesn’t really have no name.

509
00:40:43,363 --> 00:40:46,822
他姓獨孤，叫獨孤痴
His name is Tu-ku Chih.

510
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,030
他不是痴於情
He’s not crazy for love,

511
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:51,238
而是痴於劍
but crazy for swords.

512
00:40:52,113 --> 00:40:53,572
痴於情的人
Someone crazy for love will

513
00:40:53,572 --> 00:40:56,072
一定會死在痴於劍的劍下
be killed by someone crazy for swords.

514
00:40:56,488 --> 00:40:58,363
這一點你不能不信
You have to believe that.

515
00:40:59,738 --> 00:41:01,655
你為什麼要對我說這些話？
Why are you telling me these?

516
00:41:03,322 --> 00:41:05,322
因為你是我的朋友
Because you’re my friend.

517
00:42:06,363 --> 00:42:07,613
有客人來了
The guests are here.

518
00:42:07,613 --> 00:42:09,197
主人為什麼還不出來？
Where is the host?

519
00:42:09,447 --> 00:42:11,988
卜大老闆的架子未免太大了吧
Boss Pu really knows how to put on frills.

520
00:42:11,988 --> 00:42:13,988
我的架子本來就不小
Yes, I do indeed.

521
00:42:13,988 --> 00:42:15,822
這是玉女天魔柳分分
That’s Liu Fen-fen.

522
00:42:15,822 --> 00:42:17,447
那個瞎子就是搜魂手
The blind man is Soul Snatcher.

523
00:42:17,447 --> 00:42:19,530
主人既然不出來
The host refuses to come out,

524
00:42:19,530 --> 00:42:21,197
我們何不闖進去
why don’t we barge in?

525
00:42:21,655 --> 00:42:23,488
你們想要怎麼樣？
What do you want?

526
00:42:24,072 --> 00:42:26,447
三百萬兩黃金跟一個人
Three million taels of gold and a man.

527
00:42:26,905 --> 00:42:29,863
黃金不在我這裡，不能給你
I don’t have the gold and can’t give you.

528
00:42:30,738 --> 00:42:32,155
人在我這裡
I have the man

529
00:42:34,030 --> 00:42:35,363
更不能給你
but can’t give you either.

530
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,947
黃金在，人也在
You have both the gold and the man.

531
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:41,613
你們的人昨天已經來找過了
Your cohorts came yesterday

532
00:42:42,113 --> 00:42:44,655
應該知道黃金不在貨物裡
to find that we don’t have the gold.

533
00:42:45,072 --> 00:42:47,530
也沒有那麼大的地方可以藏黃金
Neither do we have so much space for it.

534
00:42:47,905 --> 00:42:49,697
除了你貓盜之外
Nobody but you, Cat Bandit,

535
00:42:50,863 --> 00:42:52,988
沒有人能從鐵翼手下
could steal the gold

536
00:42:52,988 --> 00:42:54,238
劫走那批黃金
from Tieh Yi.

537
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,613
衛天鵬
Wei Tien-peng,

538
00:42:55,613 --> 00:42:58,905
你這樣子，他是不會承認的
he’ll never admit it.

539
00:42:58,905 --> 00:43:00,572
你有辦法叫他承認？
Can you make him do that?

540
00:43:00,572 --> 00:43:02,780
法子很古老，也很俗氣
I know a traditional and dumb way,

541
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:04,280
可是最有效
but it’s effective.

542
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:06,613
勝者為強，敗者遭殃
The winner stays while the loser goes.

543
00:43:06,613 --> 00:43:07,947
如果他敗在我們手裡
If we defeat him,

544
00:43:07,947 --> 00:43:09,697
就算不是他們劫走的
even when he didn’t steal it,

545
00:43:09,697 --> 00:43:11,613
也得交出三百萬兩黃金
he’ll have to give us the gold.

546
00:43:11,613 --> 00:43:14,322
這法子好像還不錯
It sounds like a good idea.

547
00:43:15,405 --> 00:43:19,030
要卜大老闆交出三百萬兩黃金
It’s easy for Boss Pu to give us

548
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,530
似乎不難
three million taels of gold.

549
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:22,697
我們三陣賭輸贏
We’ll fight three rounds

550
00:43:22,697 --> 00:43:24,780
就賭那三百萬兩黃金
for the three million taels of gold

551
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,322
和那個人
and that man.

552
00:43:26,322 --> 00:43:27,780
我是小方
I’m Fang,

553
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,405
就是你們要找的人
the man that you’re here for.

554
00:43:29,863 --> 00:43:31,822
是不是現在就動手？
Are we going to fight now?

555
00:43:31,988 --> 00:43:34,113
他根本不是來找你這個人
He’s not here for you.

556
00:43:34,238 --> 00:43:35,572
這是他們的戰略
That’s their strategy.

557
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,280
戰略？
Strategy?

558
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,030
因為他們知道我受傷
They know that I’ve been hurt.

559
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:40,447
你不必太難過
Don’t be upset.

560
00:43:41,363 --> 00:43:44,322
能在獨孤痴劍下保存生命的
I believe that you’re the only one

561
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:47,572
除了你之外，還沒有第二個人
who survived Tu-ku Chih’s sword.

562
00:44:02,613 --> 00:44:04,530
這就是我另外一隻手
This is another arm of mine.

563
00:44:05,488 --> 00:44:06,738
也叫魔手
It’s called Magic Arm.

564
00:44:07,655 --> 00:44:09,780
裡面藏有十七種暗器
There are 17 hidden weapons

565
00:44:10,322 --> 00:44:12,613
還有七種殺人的利器
and seven deadly weapons in it.

566
00:44:12,613 --> 00:44:14,072
我也有另外一隻手
I have another arm too.

567
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:17,322
你也有另外一隻手？
You have another arm?

568
00:44:22,697 --> 00:44:23,822
在哪裡？
Where is it?

569
00:44:23,822 --> 00:44:25,280
你兩隻手全在這裡
Both your arms are right there.

570
00:44:25,655 --> 00:44:26,780
你想看？
You want to see it?

571
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:27,947
想得很
Yes, of course.

572
00:44:28,488 --> 00:44:29,905
看清楚
Watch closely.

573
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:34,072
我的雙手跟別人也沒有什麼兩樣
My arms aren’t different from others’.

574
00:44:43,488 --> 00:44:44,572
這算什麼？
What the hell?

575
00:44:45,613 --> 00:44:46,905
算你敗
You’ve lost.

576
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,488
三仗，你輸了一仗
You’ve lost the first round.

577
00:44:50,447 --> 00:44:51,697
你們以二比一
That was two against one.

578
00:44:52,697 --> 00:44:54,322
我動也沒有動過
But I didn’t move at all.

579
00:44:54,863 --> 00:44:56,322
出手的是他
It was him who fought you.

580
00:44:56,697 --> 00:44:58,155
我又沒有對你說過…
I never told you

581
00:44:58,155 --> 00:45:00,322
我另外一隻手在我身上
that other arm belongs to me.

582
00:45:18,613 --> 00:45:20,530
三仗已經輸了兩仗
You’ve lost two rounds.

583
00:45:20,947 --> 00:45:22,655
是不是還要比下去？
Are we going to keep fighting?

584
00:45:23,072 --> 00:45:24,780
無論鬥智鬥力
Nobody can outsmart

585
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:27,113
卜大老闆無人能及
or outfight Boss Pu.

586
00:45:27,572 --> 00:45:31,655
但是智者千慮，也難免會有失
But you can never//take everything into account.

587
00:45:32,613 --> 00:45:34,197
我只要一聲令下
With my order,

588
00:45:34,197 --> 00:45:37,238
片刻間他們就衝過來
they’ll charge in an instant.

589
00:45:37,238 --> 00:45:39,613
我要這裡橫屍遍地
And you’ll all be dead.

590
00:45:40,572 --> 00:45:44,155
最好你能夠睜開眼睛看一看
I wish you could open your eyes and see.

591
00:45:44,155 --> 00:45:46,238
可惜你是個瞎子
Unfortunately, you’re blind.

592
00:45:48,363 --> 00:45:50,655
衛天鵬，下令
Give an order, Wei Tien-peng!

593
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:54,738
你們動手啊
Why don’t you do anything?

594
00:46:11,905 --> 00:46:14,572
想不到呂三爺手下最好的幾位高手
It seems that Lu San’s best men

595
00:46:14,947 --> 00:46:16,613
連同旋風三十六刀
and the 36 Whirlwind Swordsmen

596
00:46:17,322 --> 00:46:18,863
都要埋葬沙漠
will be buried in the desert.

597
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:22,322
你們一動手
If you move,

598
00:46:22,322 --> 00:46:23,988
我就刺死轎子裡面的人
I’ll kill the lady in the sedan chair.

599
00:46:27,155 --> 00:46:28,322
波娃
Powa?

600
00:46:34,697 --> 00:46:35,947
讓他們走吧
Just let them go.

601
00:46:45,947 --> 00:46:47,155
讓他們走
Let them go.

602
00:47:09,738 --> 00:47:12,030
只要我不死，我一定會殺你
As long as I’m alive, I’ll kill you.

603
00:47:25,572 --> 00:47:26,447
你為了我
For me,

604
00:47:26,447 --> 00:47:28,572
失去了一個殲敵的大好機會
you’ve lost a chance to kill them.

605
00:47:30,905 --> 00:47:32,238
不全是為了你
Not just for you.

606
00:47:35,822 --> 00:47:41,697
#烈日當空
#The scorching sun high up

607
00:47:41,697 --> 00:47:47,613
#征程茫茫
#The journey ahead unknown

608
00:47:47,613 --> 00:47:53,322
#大地一飛鷹，重重越關山
#An eagle is flying over the mountains

609
00:47:53,322 --> 00:47:55,363
前面的出口兩邊山岩都有人
People are lying in ambush//on the both sides of the exit.

610
00:47:55,363 --> 00:47:57,113
可能是呂三的人埋伏在那
I think they’re sent by Lu San.

611
00:47:59,613 --> 00:48:04,738
#滿天風沙
#Blowing sand everywhere

612
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:10,572
#長途流浪
#Roving about endlessly

613
00:48:11,613 --> 00:48:13,613
#不知天涯在何方
#Never know where I belong

614
00:48:13,613 --> 00:48:15,863
我們是退回去，還是衝過去？
Are we turning around or charging ahead?

615
00:48:33,030 --> 00:48:35,572
卜鷹，我好想你
Pu Ying! I miss you so much!

616
00:48:37,738 --> 00:48:40,572
班察巴那，我好想你們喔
Bancha Bana! I miss you all!

617
00:48:41,322 --> 00:48:42,238
她是誰？
Who’s that?

618
00:48:42,238 --> 00:48:44,405
她姓藍，名叫陽光
She’s Lan Yang-kuang.

619
00:48:49,780 --> 00:48:51,530
我本來想嚇唬你們
I planned to scare you.

620
00:48:52,738 --> 00:48:55,572
可是我又怕真的把你給嚇死了
But I didn’t want to scare you to death.

621
00:48:56,238 --> 00:48:57,280
像你這麼好的人
I’ll never find

622
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,197
天下再也找不到第二個
another man as nice as you.

623
00:48:59,738 --> 00:49:01,613
哎，要是真的把你嚇死了
What if I really scared you

624
00:49:01,613 --> 00:49:02,530
那可怎麼辦
to death?

625
00:49:06,572 --> 00:49:08,447
你答應過我不要亂跑
You promised me to stay put.

626
00:49:08,447 --> 00:49:10,072
為什麼又跑出來？
What are you doing here?

627
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:11,905
你為什麼總喜歡捏我的鼻子？
Why do you always pinch my nose?

628
00:49:11,905 --> 00:49:12,822
你是不是想把我的鼻子
Do you want to make my nose

629
00:49:12,822 --> 00:49:13,988
捏得跟你一樣
look like yours?

630
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:19,238
他是誰？
Who’s that?

631
00:49:19,238 --> 00:49:21,447
他叫小方，要命的小方
He’s Fang, the damned Fang.

632
00:49:22,488 --> 00:49:24,280
為什麼叫他要命的小方呢？
Why do you call him the damned Fang?

633
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:25,947
因為他跟你一樣要命
Because he’s damned like you,

634
00:49:25,947 --> 00:49:28,738
有時候把人嚇死，有時候把人氣死
either scares or upsets people to death.

635
00:49:29,613 --> 00:49:31,655
而他自己卻是個偏偏不要命的人
But he’s never afraid to be killed.

636
00:49:34,238 --> 00:49:35,780
我喜歡不要命的男人
I like a man unafraid to be killed.

637
00:49:36,613 --> 00:49:38,280
現在我開始喜歡你了
I’m beginning to like you.

638
00:49:39,447 --> 00:49:41,780
卜鷹的朋友，就是我的朋友
Pu Ying’s friends are my friends.

639
00:49:42,238 --> 00:49:44,613
卜鷹喜歡的人，我都喜歡
I like whoever Pu Ying likes.

640
00:49:46,238 --> 00:49:47,530
我也喜歡你
I like you too.

641
00:49:48,238 --> 00:49:49,697
真的喜歡你
I really do.

642
00:50:05,363 --> 00:50:07,447
我叫齊小燕，請你跟我走
I’m Chi Hsiao-yen. Please come with me.

643
00:50:08,863 --> 00:50:10,947
跟你走，為什麼？
Go with you? Why?

644
00:50:11,447 --> 00:50:13,405
因為有一個朋友叫我來找你
A friend asked me to find you here.

645
00:50:13,405 --> 00:50:15,113
我已經在這裡等你一夜了
I’ve waited for you all night.

646
00:50:16,363 --> 00:50:17,947
你知道我是誰？
You know who I am?

647
00:50:17,947 --> 00:50:20,280
我當然知道，你姓方
Of course I do. You’re Fang.

648
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,197
別人都叫你要命的小方
People call you the damned Fang.

649
00:50:22,530 --> 00:50:24,072
你怎麼知道我在這裡？
How do you know that I’m here?

650
00:50:24,822 --> 00:50:27,363
全拉薩城的人都知道你來了
All the people in Lhasa know you’re here.

651
00:50:28,363 --> 00:50:29,613
我那個朋友是誰？
Who’s the friend?

652
00:50:29,780 --> 00:50:30,988
我不能說
I can’t tell you.

653
00:50:33,572 --> 00:50:34,488
為什麼？
Why not?

654
00:50:34,488 --> 00:50:36,322
因為他要我替他守秘密
He asked me to keep it a secret.

655
00:50:36,322 --> 00:50:37,780
我已經答應他了
And I promised him.

656
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:39,988
就算你殺了我，我也不會說出來的
I won’t tell you even if you kill me.

657
00:50:43,113 --> 00:50:44,613
好，我跟你去
Okay. I’ll go with you.

658
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:45,905
走
Let’s go.

659
00:50:48,572 --> 00:50:49,863
這些都是我做的
I’ve made all these.

660
00:50:49,863 --> 00:50:51,072
你看得出這些鳥籠…
Do you know how

661
00:50:51,072 --> 00:50:52,488
有什麼特別的地方？
these birdcages are unique?

662
00:50:53,238 --> 00:50:54,780
鳥籠的門全都開著
The doors are all open,

663
00:50:54,780 --> 00:50:56,363
而且裡面沒有鳥
and there’s no bird inside.

664
00:50:56,947 --> 00:50:58,030
鳥都飛了
The birds flew away

665
00:50:58,030 --> 00:50:59,947
因為我不願牠們當囚犯
because I don’t want to imprison them.

666
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:03,738
只要牠們高興，隨時都可以飛出去
They can fly away whenever they want,

667
00:51:03,738 --> 00:51:06,322
可是飛走的往往又會飛回來
but they’ll come back eventually

668
00:51:06,322 --> 00:51:08,030
因為我是牠們的朋友
because I’m their friend.

669
00:51:09,238 --> 00:51:10,738
你的朋友在裡面
Your friend’s in there.

670
00:51:18,822 --> 00:51:20,780
我是小方，我來了
I’m Fang. I’m here.

671
00:51:22,780 --> 00:51:24,072
坐
Sit down.

672
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:33,238
是你
It’s you.

673
00:51:33,613 --> 00:51:34,988
是我
It’s me.

674
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:38,030
你一定想不到是我找你來
You’d never think//it was me who asked for you.

675
00:51:38,738 --> 00:51:40,280
我是沒想到
You’re right.

676
00:51:40,447 --> 00:51:44,947
我找你來是因為我沒有朋友
I asked for you because I have no friends.

677
00:51:44,947 --> 00:51:47,572
你雖然不是我的朋友
Although you’re not my friend,

678
00:51:47,572 --> 00:51:50,363
但是我知道你一定會來
I knew you’d come.

679
00:51:52,197 --> 00:51:53,822
你應該看得出
You can see that

680
00:51:54,405 --> 00:51:57,155
我這隻手是被人捏碎的
someone grasped my hand and broke it.

681
00:51:58,697 --> 00:52:01,113
只有一個人能捏碎我的手
Only one man can break my hand.

682
00:52:01,697 --> 00:52:05,405
卜鷹，他不是劍客，也不是英雄
Pu Ying. He isn’t a swordsman or hero.

683
00:52:05,405 --> 00:52:06,822
他是個人傑
He’s an outstanding man.

684
00:52:07,530 --> 00:52:11,863
他的心中只有勝，沒有敗
He knows only victory, not defeat.

685
00:52:11,863 --> 00:52:13,947
只許勝，不許敗
He allows only victory, not defeat.

686
00:52:14,697 --> 00:52:15,822
為求勝
In order to win,

687
00:52:16,322 --> 00:52:19,822
他故意讓我的劍刺入他的胸膛
he guided my sword to stab into his chest.

688
00:52:19,822 --> 00:52:21,405
就在這一霎那
In that instant,

689
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:24,363
他毀了我這隻握劍的手
he broke my sword-holding hand.

690
00:52:27,363 --> 00:52:31,238
我看得出你雖然失去了握劍的手
I can see that without the hand,

691
00:52:31,238 --> 00:52:33,572
但心中仍然充滿劍氣
you still wield the sword in your mind.

692
00:52:34,613 --> 00:52:36,697
所以我才找你來
That’s what I want from you.

693
00:52:36,697 --> 00:52:38,238
你要我殺卜鷹？
You want me to kill Pu Ying?

694
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:39,530
不是
No.

695
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:42,113
我要你去為我殺一個該殺的人
I want you to kill someone//who deserve to die.

696
00:52:42,113 --> 00:52:42,905
誰？
Who?

697
00:52:43,322 --> 00:52:44,197
波娃
Powa.

698
00:52:44,197 --> 00:52:45,488
波娃？
Powa?

699
00:52:46,322 --> 00:52:47,405
為什麼？
Why?

700
00:52:49,155 --> 00:52:51,697
如今我是個無用的廢人
I’ve been maimed.

701
00:52:51,697 --> 00:52:53,697
知道秘密又太多
And I know too many secrets.

702
00:52:54,238 --> 00:52:57,863
胡氏那班人絕不是我的對手
Hu and his men will never defeat me.

703
00:52:57,863 --> 00:53:01,113
所以呂三派波娃主持殺我
That’s why Lu San sent Powa to kill me.

704
00:53:02,697 --> 00:53:04,155
波娃會武功？
Powa knows martial arts?

705
00:53:05,822 --> 00:53:07,197
波娃用不著武功
She doesn’t have to.

706
00:53:08,197 --> 00:53:09,863
魅力就是她的武器
She uses her charms as her best weapon.

707
00:53:10,447 --> 00:53:12,613
她可以指使任何人來殺我
She can make anyone kill me.

708
00:53:14,988 --> 00:53:16,197
我不答應
I can’t do that.

709
00:53:16,197 --> 00:53:17,613
你不能不答應
You have to.

710
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:20,530
波娃跟那三百萬兩黃金有關
Powa is related to the stolen gold.

711
00:53:21,363 --> 00:53:24,947
要命的小方一向不要錢
The damned Fang never wants money.

712
00:53:25,572 --> 00:53:27,322
為什麼會突然改變
Why do you change your mind

713
00:53:27,322 --> 00:53:29,197
對那些黃金這麼關心？
and take the stolen gold to heart?

714
00:53:32,905 --> 00:53:35,363
（鷹記商號）
"Ying’s Trading"

715
00:53:35,405 --> 00:53:36,530
謝謝
Thank you.

716
00:53:37,697 --> 00:53:39,905
普松喇嘛在等你，等你很久了
Puson Lama has been waiting for you.

717
00:53:40,780 --> 00:53:41,822
普松喇嘛？
Puson Lama?

718
00:53:41,822 --> 00:53:44,405
布達拉宮裡面最受人敬仰的喇嘛
The most respected lama//in the Potala Palace.

719
00:53:51,113 --> 00:53:53,447
我就是方偉，你找我何事？
I’m Fang Wei. How can I help you?

720
00:53:59,863 --> 00:54:01,738
要知道我為什麼來找你
If you want to know how you can help me,

721
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:03,613
你就跟我來
just come with me.

722
00:55:09,405 --> 00:55:12,197
我要找你，因為我要你死
I visited you because I want to kill you.

723
00:55:12,697 --> 00:55:14,780
剛才我已經知道
I’ve found that

724
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:19,447
你是有名的劍客，現在手裡沒有劍
you’re a famous swordsman without a sword.

725
00:55:19,447 --> 00:55:22,863
我殺人不用劍，而用手
I kill with my hands, not a sword.

726
00:55:22,863 --> 00:55:24,197
我的手卻還在
But I have my hands here.

727
00:55:24,197 --> 00:55:25,947
看來是這樣
I can see that.

728
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:29,155
所以我不會死，你會死
So I won’t die, but you will.

729
00:56:31,905 --> 00:56:33,280
你的劍？
Your sword...

730
00:56:33,363 --> 00:56:36,197
在我心裡，這是一把心劍
It’s a sword in my heart.

731
00:56:39,655 --> 00:56:41,197
波…波娃
Powa...

732
00:56:44,655 --> 00:56:46,738
是不是波娃叫你來殺我的？
Did Powa ask you to kill me?

733
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,238
對，修道數十年
Yes. I’ve been a lama for years.

734
00:56:50,238 --> 00:56:54,947
我自認已經摒棄七情六慾
I thought I’d been ridden of all desires.

735
00:56:54,947 --> 00:56:58,530
沒有想到一見到她
But when I saw her,

736
00:56:58,530 --> 00:57:00,697
就無法控制自己
I couldn’t control myself.

737
00:57:01,655 --> 00:57:04,238
她要我帶你去見她
She asked me to bring you to her.

738
00:57:04,238 --> 00:57:08,113
我寧可死也不願帶你去
But I’d rather die than do that.

739
00:57:08,113 --> 00:57:12,030
我活著時，誰也不能把她搶去
When I’m alive, nobody can steal her away.

740
00:57:26,322 --> 00:57:28,488
想不到你居然沒有死
I didn’t expect you to live.

741
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,322
我要普松去找你
I asked Puson to find you

742
00:57:33,738 --> 00:57:36,197
並不是為了要你來看我
not that I wanted you to see me,

743
00:57:38,780 --> 00:57:40,613
而是為了要你的命
but that I wanted to kill you.

744
00:57:40,613 --> 00:57:43,155
難得你還會說真話
You’re finally telling me the truth.

745
00:57:44,072 --> 00:57:46,655
普松不會讓你來看我
Puson wouldn’t allow you to see me.

746
00:57:47,822 --> 00:57:50,697
如果他不能殺你
If he couldn’t kill you,

747
00:57:50,697 --> 00:57:53,238
就必定會死在你的手裡
you would kill him.

748
00:57:56,572 --> 00:57:58,280
你殺了普松
If you killed Puson,

749
00:57:58,905 --> 00:58:01,988
噶倫喇嘛一定會殺你報仇
Kalon Lama would kill you

750
00:58:01,988 --> 00:58:04,988
他們的關係就好像父子般親密
because they’re like father and son.

751
00:58:04,988 --> 00:58:06,488
可是他並沒有殺我
But he didn’t kill me.

752
00:58:09,113 --> 00:58:11,613
所以我還是算錯了一點
That’s where I was wrong.

753
00:58:13,155 --> 00:58:15,572
噶倫喇嘛比我想像的…
Kalon Lama is smarter

754
00:58:15,572 --> 00:58:18,363
更精明、更能幹
and more capable than I expected.

755
00:58:20,447 --> 00:58:22,322
他看穿了我的用心
He saw through my calculation.

756
00:58:24,113 --> 00:58:26,905
我低估了他對我的痛恨
I underestimated his hatred for me.

757
00:58:27,697 --> 00:58:30,280
他寧可放過你
He’d rather let you go

758
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:32,405
也不會讓我稱心如意
than give me what I want.

759
00:58:33,488 --> 00:58:35,072
你為什麼要告訴我這些？
Why are you telling me these?

760
00:58:36,905 --> 00:58:39,822
因為我已經沒有辦法再騙你了
Because I can’t keep telling you lies.

761
00:58:40,572 --> 00:58:42,155
你為什麼要這麼做？
Why did you do that?

762
00:58:42,197 --> 00:58:46,197
我們是仇敵，我只有想法子殺你
You’re my enemy. I have to kill you.

763
00:58:49,322 --> 00:58:51,363
噶倫喇嘛稀世的銹劍
The rare rusted sword of Kalon Lama.

764
00:58:52,113 --> 00:58:56,030
讓人相信被這把銹劍殺死的人
It’s said that those killed by it

765
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:57,655
萬劫不能復生
would never go into reincarnation.

766
00:58:58,655 --> 00:59:01,905
但是你殺了我，我也絕不怪你
But I won’t blame you if you kill me.

767
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:20,363
你殺不殺我都好，我不勉強你
It’s all right if you kill me or not.

768
00:59:20,363 --> 00:59:23,447
但是我一定要提醒你
But I need to remind you that

769
00:59:23,447 --> 00:59:27,113
你不殺我，就有人會殺你
if you don’t kill me, you’ll be killed.

770
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:28,988
我知道
I know.

771
00:59:31,530 --> 00:59:34,530
噶倫喇嘛可以在舉手之間
Kalon Lama can kill you

772
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:36,113
置你於死地
in a blink.

773
00:59:38,697 --> 00:59:40,113
我也知道
Yeah, I know.

774
00:59:40,697 --> 00:59:42,405
名劍如良駒
Like a great horse,

775
00:59:42,405 --> 00:59:46,155
你不能善用它，就應該還給我
if you can’t use the sword well,//just give it back to me.

776
00:59:56,863 --> 00:59:58,447
你想殺我
You want to kill me?

777
00:59:58,947 --> 01:00:01,530
難道你忘了我是什麼人？
Don’t you remember who I am?

778
01:00:02,572 --> 01:00:04,363
你忘了我們之間的密約？
Remember our secret agreement?

779
01:00:04,363 --> 01:00:05,613
我沒有忘
Yes, I do.

780
01:00:06,947 --> 01:00:08,780
那麼你就應該知道
Then you should know that

781
01:00:09,613 --> 01:00:11,822
如果你殺了我
if you kill me,

782
01:00:11,822 --> 01:00:14,572
你不但後悔終生
you’ll be regretful forever

783
01:00:14,572 --> 01:00:17,405
你的罪孽也就永遠沒辦法洗清
and won’t be purged of your sins.

784
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:20,863
你卻不知道我不能不殺你
But you don’t know that I have to kill you

785
01:00:20,863 --> 01:00:23,697
因為普松是我的兒子
because Puson was my real son.

786
01:00:23,697 --> 01:00:25,780
二十八年前
28 years ago,

787
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:28,822
我也遇過像你這樣的女人
I also met a woman like you.

788
01:00:28,822 --> 01:00:31,822
如今連我兒子的生命也賠上
Now my son was killed because of you.

789
01:00:51,197 --> 01:00:52,447
卜鷹？
Pu Ying?

790
01:03:16,655 --> 01:03:17,905
恭喜大師
Congratulations.

791
01:03:18,988 --> 01:03:20,822
大師已從劍中悟道
You’ve got the realization from the sword.

792
01:03:42,822 --> 01:03:45,822
我知道你心中還有一個打不開的結
I know there’s still a knot in your heart.

793
01:03:47,572 --> 01:03:49,447
能夠打開這個結的人
And I’m the only one

794
01:03:50,905 --> 01:03:52,197
只有我
who can untie it.

795
01:04:16,113 --> 01:04:18,322
呂爺，你都看到了
You saw it, Lord Lu.

796
01:04:18,322 --> 01:04:22,322
嗯，我都看到，也都聽見
Yes. I saw it and heard it.

797
01:04:22,322 --> 01:04:24,155
普松已經喪命
Puson was killed.

798
01:04:24,155 --> 01:04:26,113
噶倫喇嘛已經悟禪
Kalon Lama has got the realization.

799
01:04:27,030 --> 01:04:29,530
不會再理布達拉宮的政事
He’ll leave the Potala Palace forever.

800
01:04:30,113 --> 01:04:33,072
控制布達拉宮，也就是控制西藏
If you get the Palace, you own Tibet.

801
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:34,905
布達拉宮內
In the Potala Palace,

802
01:04:34,905 --> 01:04:37,280
再也沒有能阻撓三爺的人
nobody will impede you, my Lord.

803
01:04:38,863 --> 01:04:42,238
自命不凡的卜鷹，他萬萬沒有想到
That self-complacent Pu Ying won’t believe

804
01:04:42,238 --> 01:04:44,947
他派到我這來臥底的女人
that the woman working undercover for him

805
01:04:46,738 --> 01:04:48,613
會反他反得那麼徹底
would rebel against him.

806
01:04:48,822 --> 01:04:50,488
在我呂三爺面前
In front of me,

807
01:04:50,488 --> 01:04:52,613
他不過是一個平凡的人
he’s nobody.

808
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:11,530
倉庫禁地，任何人不能進來
You can’t go into the storeroom.

809
01:05:12,197 --> 01:05:13,280
卜鷹帶我來的
Pu Ying brought me here.

810
01:05:14,488 --> 01:05:17,113
他說他家裡我到處都可以走
He said I can walk around at will.

811
01:05:17,113 --> 01:05:18,280
回去
Get out!

812
01:05:19,488 --> 01:05:20,572
這裡例外
It’s an exception.

813
01:05:20,655 --> 01:05:22,072
這裡也不例外
It’s no exception.

814
01:05:25,655 --> 01:05:27,072
讓小方進來
Let him in.

815
01:05:31,488 --> 01:05:33,280
現在你可以相信
Now you believe

816
01:05:34,072 --> 01:05:37,447
三百萬兩黃金並不在我手中
that I don’t have the stolen gold.

817
01:05:37,822 --> 01:05:39,155
但這並不能證明…
But you can’t prove

818
01:05:39,155 --> 01:05:40,988
你沒有劫走那批黃金
that you didn’t steal the gold.

819
01:05:43,947 --> 01:05:45,405
你很細心
You’re scrupulous.

820
01:05:47,572 --> 01:05:50,155
不愧是大明邊疆的巡察使
You’re indeed a competent frontier inspector//from the Ming court.

821
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:53,197
上次在沙漠裡看見你的時候
When I saw you in the desert last time,

822
01:05:53,197 --> 01:05:55,072
我就開始懷疑你
I began to suspect you.

823
01:05:55,947 --> 01:05:59,363
以你這麼一個身經百戰的高手
Having been experienced,

824
01:05:59,363 --> 01:06:01,363
不可能在匆忙的情況下
you would never enter a desert

825
01:06:01,363 --> 01:06:03,530
帶不足的糧食和水
without enough food and water

826
01:06:03,530 --> 01:06:05,655
貿然進入沙漠
in such a hurry

827
01:06:06,697 --> 01:06:08,488
因為人人都知道
because everyone knows that

828
01:06:09,322 --> 01:06:12,030
在沙漠裡渴死
dying of thirst in a desert is worse

829
01:06:12,030 --> 01:06:15,697
遠比死在敵人的亂刀下痛苦
than being killed by your enemies’ swords.

830
01:06:17,655 --> 01:06:20,697
所以你一直跟著我，考驗我
That’s why you followed and tested me,

831
01:06:20,697 --> 01:06:23,613
你並不是真的要等我死，拿我的劍
not to wait for my death and sword.

832
01:06:24,613 --> 01:06:27,488
很久以後我才領悟到
I realized after a long while

833
01:06:27,488 --> 01:06:30,738
你就是大明邊疆巡察使
that you’re the frontier inspector.

834
01:06:30,738 --> 01:06:31,738
為了阻止呂三
In order to stop Lu San from

835
01:06:31,738 --> 01:06:34,863
用黃金支援元朝的餘黨
supporting the Yuan remnants with gold,

836
01:06:34,863 --> 01:06:38,780
故意困在沙漠中，讓他們抓到你
you deliberately got yourself//stuck and caught in the desert

837
01:06:38,780 --> 01:06:41,447
以便打聽黃金的秘密
to find out the secrets about the gold.

838
01:06:41,447 --> 01:06:43,863
說不定你殺死呂三的兒子
Maybe you killed Lu San’s son

839
01:06:43,863 --> 01:06:46,738
唯一的理由就是讓他們追捕你
just to get them to hunt you down.

840
01:06:46,738 --> 01:06:48,113
你到底是什麼人？
Who the hell are you?

841
01:06:48,113 --> 01:06:49,488
我就是卜鷹
I’m Pu Ying,

842
01:06:50,072 --> 01:06:51,863
一個平凡的西藏人
an ordinary Tibetan

843
01:06:52,447 --> 01:06:55,697
懷念西藏依附中原的盛世
nostalgic for the past prosperity

844
01:06:55,697 --> 01:06:57,780
不讓呂三統治西藏
who doesn’t want Lu San to rule Tibet.

845
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:59,405
既然不是你
If you didn’t do it,

846
01:06:59,405 --> 01:07:02,072
還有誰能搶這批黃金？
who would steal the gold?

847
01:07:02,072 --> 01:07:04,238
黃金是我搶的
I stole the gold,

848
01:07:04,238 --> 01:07:06,613
不過不藏在這裡
but it’s not hidden here.

849
01:07:09,197 --> 01:07:13,447
卜鷹，你真是個對敵人捨身求勝
You show no mercy on your enemies,

850
01:07:13,447 --> 01:07:16,697
對朋友捨生取義的人傑
but you’re loyal to friends.

851
01:07:16,697 --> 01:07:20,863
不過要做你的朋友，有時候很難
But it’s not easy to be your friend.

852
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:24,863
呂三運三百萬兩黃金到拉薩的消息
Powa told me Lu San was about to transport

853
01:07:24,863 --> 01:07:26,905
就是波娃洩漏給我的
three million taels of gold to Lhasa.

854
01:07:26,905 --> 01:07:28,405
波娃怎麼會知道？
How did she know that?

855
01:07:28,405 --> 01:07:31,363
她是我派出埋伏在呂三身邊的人
She worked undercover for me.

856
01:07:31,363 --> 01:07:33,572
劫來的黃金就埋在沙漠
The stolen gold is buried in the desert.

857
01:07:34,863 --> 01:07:36,363
一望無際的沙漠
The desert is vast and limitless.

858
01:07:36,363 --> 01:07:38,072
你怎麼認得出來？
How can you recognize the burial site?

859
01:07:38,072 --> 01:07:40,322
因為我血管裡流的是沙
Because sand is flowing in my veins

860
01:07:40,322 --> 01:07:42,072
沙漠是我的根
and the desert is my root.

861
01:07:42,072 --> 01:07:43,780
我還有什麼地方認不出來的
I can recognize it at a glance.

862
01:07:43,988 --> 01:07:49,822
#烈日當空
#The scorching sun high up

863
01:07:49,822 --> 01:07:55,780
#征程茫茫
#The journey ahead unknown

864
01:07:55,780 --> 01:08:06,572
#大地一飛鷹，重重越關山
#An eagle is flying over the mountains

865
01:08:07,738 --> 01:08:12,780
#滿天風沙
#Blowing sand everywhere

866
01:08:13,738 --> 01:08:18,737
#長途流浪
#Roving about endlessly

867
01:08:19,655 --> 01:08:30,612
#不知天涯在何方
#Never know where I belong

868
01:08:36,655 --> 01:08:38,530
三百萬兩黃金都在這裡
The three million taels of gold is here.

869
01:08:43,197 --> 01:08:46,237
巡察使，你現在準備怎麼辦？
What do we do now, Inspector?

870
01:08:46,822 --> 01:08:49,112
只要黃金不在蒙古人手裡
As long as the Moguls don’t have the gold

871
01:08:49,112 --> 01:08:51,655
元朝餘黨無法再進犯中原
and the Yuan remnants can’t invade us,

872
01:08:52,155 --> 01:08:54,030
我的任務就算完成一半
my mission is half completed.

873
01:08:54,237 --> 01:08:55,112
另一半呢？
What about the other half?

874
01:08:55,947 --> 01:08:57,987
要看黃金落在誰手裡
It depends on who gets the gold.

875
01:08:58,155 --> 01:08:59,447
落在我的手裡
It’s in my hands.

876
01:08:59,447 --> 01:09:00,947
在一代人傑手裡
In the hand of an outstanding man,

877
01:09:00,947 --> 01:09:02,987
一定可以造福西藏老百姓
it’ll do the Tibetans good.

878
01:09:09,530 --> 01:09:10,655
我們被跟蹤了
We’ve been followed.

879
01:09:10,737 --> 01:09:12,197
他不怕有人跟蹤
He’s not afraid of being followed

880
01:09:12,572 --> 01:09:16,072
因為他知道這一路我都在你們附近
because he knows that I’ve been around.

881
01:09:16,447 --> 01:09:19,322
就算有狐狸跟蹤，我早就抓到他
If a fox followed you, I’d catch him

882
01:09:19,322 --> 01:09:20,572
剝他的皮
and skin him alive.

883
01:09:22,155 --> 01:09:24,905
可是你們就沒發現我這隻狐狸
But you’ve missed this fox.

884
01:09:24,905 --> 01:09:25,655
陽光
Yang-kuang?

885
01:09:25,655 --> 01:09:27,112
我要她送你一程
I asked her to see you off.

886
01:09:27,487 --> 01:09:31,447
對，我也得趕回京城，奏請朝廷
Yeah. I have to go back to the capital

887
01:09:31,447 --> 01:09:33,822
通令全國捉拿呂三
and asked the emperor to arrest Lu San.

888
01:09:39,780 --> 01:09:42,737
我留在這裡，一方面守著黃金
I’ll stay here to guard the gold

889
01:09:42,737 --> 01:09:45,905
一方面注意呂三在拉薩的勢力
and monitor Lu San in Lhasa.

890
01:09:47,197 --> 01:09:47,780
再說
Besides...

891
01:09:50,780 --> 01:09:53,697
你路不熟，在路上你必須要有個伴
you’re a stranger here. You need company.

892
01:10:01,947 --> 01:10:03,905
卜鷹為什麼要你送得那麼遠？
Why did Pu Ying ask you to see me off?

893
01:10:04,405 --> 01:10:05,697
我也不知道
I don’t know.

894
01:10:06,947 --> 01:10:08,155
你是他什麼人？
Who are you to him?

895
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:12,488
我是他未婚妻，我們已經有了婚約
I’m his fiancée. We’re engaged.

896
01:10:14,113 --> 01:10:15,905
他一直不讓你知道這件事
He didn’t want you to know that

897
01:10:16,155 --> 01:10:17,697
他認為你很喜歡我
because he knew you like me.

898
01:10:18,947 --> 01:10:20,863
而且他一直覺得自己老了
And he always thinks that

899
01:10:20,863 --> 01:10:22,113
配不上我
he’s too old for me.

900
01:10:22,947 --> 01:10:24,155
所以…
So...

901
01:10:24,322 --> 01:10:27,113
所以他才讓你送我，送到江南
he wants you to come with me to the south.

902
01:10:27,113 --> 01:10:28,488
他就是這樣一個人
That’s how he has always been.

903
01:10:29,113 --> 01:10:30,780
總是替別人著想
He does everything for others,

904
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,030
從不替自己想想
never for himself.

905
01:10:33,822 --> 01:10:36,988
可是他的外表卻偏偏冷得像冰一樣
But he looks as cold as ice.

906
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:42,655
這些事他寧死都不會對你說
He’ll never tell you because

907
01:10:42,655 --> 01:10:45,613
因為他不願意讓你心裡有負擔
he doesn’t want you to feel pressured

908
01:10:45,613 --> 01:10:47,363
不願意讓你感激他
or like you owe him something.

909
01:10:50,363 --> 01:10:51,822
不管他怎麼對我
Whatever he does to me,

910
01:10:52,363 --> 01:10:54,113
我對他都不會變的
I’ll always be loyal to him.

911
01:10:54,655 --> 01:10:56,613
所以不管到什麼地方
So wherever you go,

912
01:10:56,613 --> 01:10:57,988
你都一定會回去的
you’ll go back to him eventually.

913
01:10:58,613 --> 01:11:00,322
你明白我的意思？
You know what I mean?

914
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:01,655
我當然明白
Of course I do.

915
01:11:02,780 --> 01:11:04,322
我知道他沒有看錯你
I knew he was right.

916
01:11:04,322 --> 01:11:05,697
你的確是他的朋友
You’re his best friend indeed.

917
01:11:26,322 --> 01:11:27,447
柳分分
Liu Fen-fen?

918
01:11:34,822 --> 01:11:35,905
不要動她！
Don’t touch her!

919
01:11:36,655 --> 01:11:37,655
為什麼？
Why?

920
01:11:38,238 --> 01:11:39,613
這是一個陷阱
It’s a trap.

921
01:11:40,030 --> 01:11:41,238
你只要一動她
If you touch her,

922
01:11:41,238 --> 01:11:42,863
他們就會知道我們經過這
they’ll know we’ve been here.

923
01:11:43,947 --> 01:11:45,280
他們是誰？
Who do you mean?

924
01:11:45,655 --> 01:11:47,572
呂三用黃金收買的人
The people bribed by Lu San with gold.

925
01:11:49,072 --> 01:11:50,530
柳分分也是他們的人
Liu Fen-fen is also one of them.

926
01:11:50,530 --> 01:11:51,863
為什麼要這樣對付她？
Why did they do this to her?

927
01:11:52,363 --> 01:11:54,780
呂三利用她來引誘我們中他的圈套
Lu San uses her to lure us into his trap

928
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:56,405
同時也是在懲罰她
and punishes her at the same time.

929
01:11:56,905 --> 01:11:58,072
我們走吧
Let’s go.

930
01:12:01,655 --> 01:12:03,780
既然你不能救她，又不忍心殺她
Since you can’t save her or kill her,

931
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:05,113
為什麼不肯走呢？
why don’t you just go?

932
01:12:09,072 --> 01:12:10,655
再不走他們的人就快來了
They’ll be here anytime.

933
01:13:16,488 --> 01:13:17,863
他們還沒走
They’re still around.

934
01:13:19,530 --> 01:13:22,363
我看他們是永遠跟定了
I don’t think they’ll leave us.

935
01:13:34,072 --> 01:13:35,322
這個泥娃娃
The clay doll

936
01:13:36,072 --> 01:13:38,280
是他特地從無錫帶回來的
was brought by him from Wuxi.

937
01:13:38,905 --> 01:13:40,905
你這麼喜歡江南的東西
You love what’s from the south.

938
01:13:40,905 --> 01:13:42,655
等到了京城以後
When we’re in the capital,

939
01:13:42,655 --> 01:13:45,947
我帶你去吃江南的桂花糕、荷葉糖
I’ll buy you osmanthus cakes//and lotus leaf candy.

940
01:13:45,947 --> 01:13:47,697
沒有到過江南的人
Those who have never been to the south

941
01:13:47,697 --> 01:13:49,405
都會想到江南去
want to go there.

942
01:13:50,238 --> 01:13:55,238
可是到了江南，我會想念拉薩
But when I’m there, I’ll miss Lhasa.

943
01:13:55,238 --> 01:13:56,072
拉薩？
Lhasa?

944
01:13:57,030 --> 01:13:58,988
是卜鷹，還是拉薩？
Pu Ying or Lhasa?

945
01:14:45,613 --> 01:14:47,530
我有一種很滑稽的想法
I have a funny idea.

946
01:14:48,197 --> 01:14:51,363
我現在正在做卜鷹曾經做過的事情
I’m doing what Pu Ying did once.

947
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:56,030
在這小木屋裡跟你促膝相對
Talking to you in this cabin

948
01:14:57,530 --> 01:14:58,697
跟你喝酒
and drinking with you.

949
01:15:08,655 --> 01:15:11,738
我們曾經在這裡醉過三天三夜
We got drunk here//for three nights and days.

950
01:16:05,572 --> 01:16:07,655
這酒好香
The wine tastes great.

951
01:17:31,572 --> 01:17:33,072
今天天氣真不錯
The weather is fine.

952
01:17:33,238 --> 01:17:34,655
你想不想出去走走？
Do you want to take a walk?

953
01:17:35,113 --> 01:17:38,322
我不去，你去，我在這等你
No. You go ahead. I’ll be waiting here.

954
01:17:38,738 --> 01:17:40,697
我一個人去，很快就回來
I’ll go alone. Be right back.

955
01:18:16,405 --> 01:18:17,655
我回來得快不快？
Am I back soon enough?

956
01:18:19,488 --> 01:18:20,780
快極了
More than enough.

957
01:18:27,613 --> 01:18:29,863
這條路也不通，你還是回去吧
It’s a dead end. Go back now.

958
01:18:47,280 --> 01:18:50,280
這一年內你休想走出小木屋一步
You’ll stay in the cabin for a year.

959
01:19:02,238 --> 01:19:03,447
你受傷了沒有？
Are you hurt?

960
01:19:03,947 --> 01:19:06,780
沒有，因為他們根本不想要我的命
No. They didn’t even want to kill me.

961
01:19:07,655 --> 01:19:08,988
如果想呢？
What if they did?

962
01:19:09,488 --> 01:19:11,113
那我已經是個死人了
Then I’d be dead.

963
01:19:16,530 --> 01:19:18,863
時候不早了，不如早點睡吧
It’s late. Let’s go to bed.

964
01:19:19,155 --> 01:19:22,655
好，你睡床，我睡地板
Yeah. The bed is yours.//I’ll sleep on the floor.

965
01:19:24,572 --> 01:19:26,405
我睡床，你也睡床
I’ll sleep on the bed, and you too.

966
01:19:28,113 --> 01:19:29,363
好
Okay.

967
01:19:31,447 --> 01:19:33,613
你睡床，我也睡床
You’ll sleep on the bed, and me too.

968
01:19:37,947 --> 01:19:39,447
我有一個想法
I have an idea.

969
01:19:40,072 --> 01:19:42,113
他們不想殺死你
They didn’t want to kill you.

970
01:19:42,113 --> 01:19:43,863
只想逼你跟我睡上床
But they’re forcing you to sleep with me.

971
01:19:43,863 --> 01:19:46,280
而且他們都有偷窺狂
And they’re all peeping Toms.

972
01:19:46,280 --> 01:19:48,738
可是又不肯躲在窗縫裡偷看
But they refuse to peep through a window.

973
01:19:48,738 --> 01:19:51,197
乾脆把屋頂、牆壁都拆了
So they tore up the roof and walls.

974
01:19:52,655 --> 01:19:54,697
你曾經積過什麼陰德？
What good have you done

975
01:19:54,697 --> 01:19:56,113
讓這麼多人肯為你安排…
to make all those people arrange

976
01:19:56,113 --> 01:19:57,988
這麼美好的一件事
such a beautiful thing for you?

977
01:19:57,988 --> 01:20:02,197
我把富貴神仙呂三的獨生兒子宰掉
I killed Lu San’s only son.

978
01:20:03,197 --> 01:20:04,655
那呂三為什麼不殺了你
Then why didn’t he kill you

979
01:20:04,655 --> 01:20:05,947
替他兒子報仇呢？
to seek his revenge on you?

980
01:20:05,947 --> 01:20:07,322
呂三要你跟我生兒子
Lu San wants you to give me a son.

981
01:20:07,322 --> 01:20:08,363
再殺我的兒子
Then he’ll kill my son.

982
01:20:08,363 --> 01:20:10,363
也讓我嘗嘗喪子之痛
He wants me to grieve for it too.

983
01:20:10,363 --> 01:20:11,738
怪不得那個追風叟
No wonder Wind Chaser

984
01:20:11,738 --> 01:20:13,822
要你在這裡待上一年
ordered you to stay here for a year.

985
01:20:13,822 --> 01:20:16,363
他大概是想在這一年之內
He wants us to give birth

986
01:20:16,363 --> 01:20:18,238
我們總有辦法生出個兒子吧
to a son within the year.

987
01:20:20,322 --> 01:20:22,988
如果我是個天生不育的男人
If I was born infertile,

988
01:20:22,988 --> 01:20:24,113
那呂三這個計畫
Lu San’s plan

989
01:20:24,113 --> 01:20:25,530
一輩子也成功不了了
will never work.

990
01:20:36,738 --> 01:20:39,572
繼續笑，我們快離開這裡，回拉薩
Keep laughing. Let’s get out of here//and go back to Lhasa.

991
01:20:40,697 --> 01:20:41,822
想卜鷹？
You miss Pu Ying?

992
01:20:41,822 --> 01:20:44,447
對，呂三派這麼多人看住我們
Yeah. Lu San has sent so many people here.

993
01:20:44,447 --> 01:20:46,447
也會派更多的人去拜訪卜鷹
He must’ve sent more to visit Pu Ying.

994
01:20:47,405 --> 01:20:48,780
拼命也要離開這裡
We have to get out of here.

995
01:20:50,530 --> 01:20:51,988
讓我來想個辦法
I’ll figure out a way.

996
01:21:23,947 --> 01:21:25,197
看得清楚在幹嘛？
Can you see what she’s doing?

997
01:21:25,197 --> 01:21:28,405
看不大清楚，她在幹什麼？
No. What is she doing?

998
01:21:28,405 --> 01:21:31,655
老色鬼，她在解手，看得還不夠？
Old letch! She’s relieving herself.//Have you seen enough?

999
01:24:20,988 --> 01:24:22,113
卜大老闆
Hi, Boss Pu.

1000
01:24:29,738 --> 01:24:30,863
我們的人呢？
Where are our men?

1001
01:24:32,072 --> 01:24:35,155
都被我的屬下高手消滅了
They were all killed by my men.

1002
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:43,530
卜鷹，現在該輪到你
Pu Ying, it’s your turn now.

1003
01:24:44,197 --> 01:24:47,738
我的三百萬兩黃金藏在什麼地方？
Where is my three million taels of gold?

1004
01:24:48,572 --> 01:24:50,655
我知道你一定不會告訴我
I know you won’t tell me.

1005
01:24:51,572 --> 01:24:53,072
你的確很聰明
You’re smart indeed.

1006
01:24:56,488 --> 01:24:58,155
我怎麼也沒想到
I never thought that

1007
01:24:58,738 --> 01:25:00,905
你會藏在鐵翼的屍體下
you’d hide it under Tieh Yi’s dead body.

1008
01:25:01,738 --> 01:25:03,530
黃金我找到了
I’ve got the gold.

1009
01:25:03,530 --> 01:25:05,572
也就是你該死的時候
And it’s time to kill you.

1010
01:25:07,572 --> 01:25:11,947
貓盜畢竟是人，在我的逼供之下
Cat Bandit is human after all.

1011
01:25:13,363 --> 01:25:14,863
他還是說出來了
He was put to torture and confessed.

1012
01:27:18,613 --> 01:27:20,155
他一定還活著
He must be alive.

1013
01:27:23,697 --> 01:27:25,155
他一定還活著
He must be alive.

1014
01:27:28,405 --> 01:27:29,530
阿蘇喇嘛
Asu Lama?

1015
01:27:34,197 --> 01:27:35,238
火熄了
The fire burned out.

1016
01:27:35,613 --> 01:27:38,947
我就來這裡，只找到這些骨灰
I’m here to find the bone ash.

1017
01:27:41,197 --> 01:27:42,613
是誰的骨灰？
Whose bone ash?

1018
01:27:42,697 --> 01:27:47,072
這裡有我的族人、我的朋友
I have my people and my friends here.

1019
01:27:47,072 --> 01:27:49,322
我也想知道是誰的骨灰
I want to know who’s who,

1020
01:27:50,405 --> 01:27:53,613
可惜每個人都已成了灰
but they were burned to ashes.

1021
01:27:54,447 --> 01:27:56,822
還有誰能夠分辨得出？
Who can tell who’s who?

1022
01:27:57,738 --> 01:27:58,655
是誰的骨灰？
Whose bone ash?

1023
01:28:04,780 --> 01:28:06,572
阿蘇，連你們都被收買了
You’ve been bribed too, Asu.

1024
01:28:27,613 --> 01:28:29,738
說，呂三到底在哪？
Tell me. Where is Lu San?

1025
01:28:30,905 --> 01:28:34,488
我要卜鷹死，卜鷹已經死了
I wanted Pu Ying to die, and he’s dead.

1026
01:28:34,488 --> 01:28:36,947
我呂三爺要要命的小方
I want the damned Fang

1027
01:28:36,947 --> 01:28:39,863
也嘗一嘗喪子之痛
to grieve for the loss of his son.

1028
01:28:39,863 --> 01:28:42,530
現在他跟他女朋友果然來了
And he’s here with his girlfriend.

1029
01:28:42,905 --> 01:28:45,322
也許他們是想在我這棟金宮裡
Maybe they’ll give birth to a son

1030
01:28:45,322 --> 01:28:46,572
生一個金童
in my golden palace.

1031
01:29:15,488 --> 01:29:16,738
班察巴那
Bancha Bana!

1032
01:29:20,280 --> 01:29:21,363
卜鷹呢？
Where’s Pu Ying?

1033
01:29:21,863 --> 01:29:23,697
我最後看到他的時候
When I last saw him,

1034
01:29:23,697 --> 01:29:25,488
他已陷在火焰中
he was stuck in the flames.

1035
01:29:26,780 --> 01:29:28,113
卜鷹死了？
Pu Ying is dead?

1036
01:29:29,155 --> 01:29:31,947
班察巴那可以從火中逃走
I managed to escape from the fire.

1037
01:29:31,947 --> 01:29:33,947
卜鷹是班察巴那的主人
Pu Ying is my master.

1038
01:29:35,322 --> 01:29:36,822
卜鷹更不會死
I don’t think he died.

1039
01:29:38,030 --> 01:29:39,738
現在會死的
Who’s going to die now...

1040
01:29:41,655 --> 01:29:42,905
只有呂三
...is Lu San.

1041
01:29:53,738 --> 01:29:55,030
波娃還給你
Powa is yours now.

1042
01:29:57,322 --> 01:30:00,280
班察巴那，她一直是你的女人
Bancha Bana, she has been your woman.

1043
01:30:00,905 --> 01:30:02,947
現在你可以把她帶走
You can take her away.

1044
01:37:10,863 --> 01:37:11,863
陽光
Yang-kuang?

1045
01:37:14,072 --> 01:37:15,238
陽光
Yang-kuang!

1046
01:37:18,447 --> 01:37:19,655
陽光
Yang-kuang?

1047
01:37:39,530 --> 01:37:43,447
小方，把陽光送回卜鷹的懷抱
Fang, escort Yang-kuang back to Pu Ying,

1048
01:37:43,988 --> 01:37:47,155
把三百萬兩黃金運回大明朝
and the stolen gold to the court.

1049
01:37:50,780 --> 01:37:59,447
（劇終）
"The End"
