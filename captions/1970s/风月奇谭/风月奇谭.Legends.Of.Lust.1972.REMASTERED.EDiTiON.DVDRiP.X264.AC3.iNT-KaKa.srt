1
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:24,951
I lift up my head

2
00:00:25,058 --> 00:00:27,618
Here I am at the Fengyue Brothel

3
00:00:27,727 --> 00:00:29,456
The girls are lovely here

4
00:00:29,562 --> 00:00:31,826
All very charming

5
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:34,259
Cuihong, Xiaoxiao

6
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,358
Haixian, Yindi and Jinbao

7
00:00:36,669 --> 00:00:38,432
Big eyes

8
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,699
Slim waists

9
00:00:40,807 --> 00:00:42,672
Gorgeous figures

10
00:00:42,776 --> 00:00:45,677
Perfect! All the right curves
in right places

11
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:49,510
Girls, upstairs downstairs,
front and back courtyards

12
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:53,746
Come out to greet the guests

13
00:00:53,853 --> 00:00:56,253
They're here

14
00:01:10,703 --> 00:01:14,400
Haitang, Qingwen

15
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:21,845
Xiaoyu, Meibao, Meihong

16
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:31,855
Guohua, Xiaojuan, Yulan

17
00:01:34,327 --> 00:01:42,462
Yingchun, Meifang, Huijuan

18
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,568
What's going on?

19
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:52,111
They are like Romeo and Juliet

20
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:54,237
They've got hearts for each other

21
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:56,339
Really?

22
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:59,947
Mr. Wang has been here for over a month

23
00:02:00,053 --> 00:02:01,782
He has very much taken to Jinbao

24
00:02:01,888 --> 00:02:04,618
They seem serious

25
00:02:05,492 --> 00:02:07,722
He has spent all his money

26
00:02:07,827 --> 00:02:10,227
He'll go back home in Shanghai
to get more

27
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:13,128
Crying their eyes out

28
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:16,862
Exchanging their vows, and love tokens

29
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,631
What kind of love tokens?

30
00:02:18,738 --> 00:02:21,400
Mr. Wang said he'll take out a tooth

31
00:02:21,508 --> 00:02:23,533
He will marry no one but Jinbao

32
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,441
And Jinbao will cut off her hair

33
00:02:26,546 --> 00:02:29,709
She said she'll be his wife for sure

34
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:32,284
I'm getting her a pair of scissors

35
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:33,313
Did she mean it?

36
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,284
This is the Fengyue Brothel

37
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:36,446
That's the Chonger Room

38
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:37,648
Named after the famous brothel

39
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:38,621
Over here is the Yinshuo Room

40
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,090
Meaning relaxed so to speak

41
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,855
Things are true and false
at the same time

42
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:45,430
No, I meant the tooth

43
00:02:45,532 --> 00:02:47,830
Of course

44
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:52,363
You... have done it?

45
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:55,339
Yes, a word is a word

46
00:02:56,409 --> 00:02:59,071
Jinbao, I'm serious about you

47
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,908
Xiaowang, my heart aches

48
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:06,445
And I'm in pain too

49
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:13,726
She's doing this for real?

50
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:15,350
Of course not

51
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,893
You can't trust a prostitute

52
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:21,125
The rich customer has fallen in love

53
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:25,132
Jinbao, have you cut your hair?

54
00:03:25,972 --> 00:03:28,770
Take this;
you'll know I'm always with you

55
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:30,906
Jinbao

56
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:35,142
My precious...

57
00:03:38,484 --> 00:03:40,611
Don't worry, once I arrive in Shanghai

58
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,948
...I'll let my parents know

59
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,886
I'll come back for you

60
00:03:45,258 --> 00:03:47,351
Remember to bring the things I want

61
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:48,355
Yes I will

62
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:51,730
Mountains of gold, silver,
anything you want

63
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:55,893
Baozhu, Cuilian, Xiaofeng

64
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,828
Xiaocui, Qiuhong

65
00:04:00,773 --> 00:04:03,435
They're all here, sirs

66
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,075
Some have customers, some are escorts

67
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,341
I heard there are three new girls

68
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,542
One is the lady boss of a pottery store?

69
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,176
I heard she's quite a woman

70
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:16,681
You meant Haixian?

71
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:18,814
Yes, call her here

72
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:21,587
Because of her affairs her husband died

73
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:22,626
Really?

74
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:24,853
Call her

75
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:26,823
She's very popular

76
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:27,900
We'll wait

77
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,970
There's a long list; maybe not today

78
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,196
She's so popular?

79
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:34,296
Yes, let me tell you

80
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:39,035
She's good in bed, and off the bed too

81
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:41,274
Right next door

82
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:45,740
Stop it

83
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,558
Why are you in such a hurry?

84
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:59,091
I can't wait

85
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,064
Are you for real?

86
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:04,433
The word is that
you cheated on your husband

87
00:05:04,537 --> 00:05:05,595
Is that the truth?

88
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:08,634
All men cheat

89
00:05:08,741 --> 00:05:10,504
...on their wives. And then

90
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,840
...you go around accusing wives
to be promiscuous

91
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,478
Tell me what happened

92
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:20,384
Cheating on husbands

93
00:05:24,223 --> 00:05:27,624
It's so unfair

94
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:31,519
If a woman is caught cheating

95
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:32,893
She got beaten to death

96
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:38,534
Marriage to a useless guy
is so unfortunate

97
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,356
Lady boss...

98
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:06,389
Hey, you scared me!

99
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,194
What were you thinking about?

100
00:06:09,969 --> 00:06:11,493
She's quite pretty

101
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:13,128
Can't believe she cheated on her husband

102
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:16,538
Right, she deserves to be cut into pieces

103
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:19,235
What do you want to buy?

104
00:06:19,345 --> 00:06:20,141
A chamber pot

105
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,880
My husband broke it

106
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,838
How come she knows your size?

107
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:51,375
Oh!

108
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:52,739
What?

109
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:54,773
What are you talking about?

110
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:56,348
Ain't the first time
you buying a chamber pot from her

111
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,508
Wang Dachui

112
00:07:02,021 --> 00:07:03,352
Lawyer Diao...

113
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:05,151
You have a pen?

114
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:05,952
A pen?

115
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:07,823
To write down my accounts

116
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:10,418
I use charcoal

117
00:07:10,797 --> 00:07:11,729
Lady boss...

118
00:07:12,298 --> 00:07:13,128
Lawyer Diao...

119
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,224
Could I borrow a pen?

120
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:16,358
What?

121
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,959
A pen

122
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:21,802
Speak clearly

123
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,239
So, working on a new case?

124
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:25,605
Yes, that case

125
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:27,141
For the plaintiff?

126
00:07:27,246 --> 00:07:28,372
No

127
00:07:28,981 --> 00:07:31,176
Caught in the act, sent to the judge

128
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,649
Sentenced to be beheaded

129
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:33,782
For the defendant?

130
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:34,580
Can you help?

131
00:07:34,687 --> 00:07:36,177
Of course, otherwise I won't get paid

132
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,688
I don't sell chamber pots

133
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:38,955
Shut up

134
00:07:39,058 --> 00:07:40,650
Eat chamber pots

135
00:07:41,027 --> 00:07:42,392
What's there to eat?

136
00:07:42,995 --> 00:07:45,691
Do you eat a banana with the skin?

137
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:51,469
You lawyers just like to argue

138
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,835
You can turn right to wrong

139
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:55,171
Of course

140
00:07:55,274 --> 00:07:56,707
I've got to help others

141
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:59,801
I love to help

142
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:00,838
You saw her

143
00:08:00,947 --> 00:08:03,313
That girl looked pretty

144
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:05,008
And she's married to an aged fella

145
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:07,842
Aged fellow?

146
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:10,253
Hello, Boss

147
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:10,720
What aged fellow?

148
00:08:10,823 --> 00:08:12,654
Wang, the boss is back

149
00:08:12,758 --> 00:08:14,487
I'm chatting with the lady boss

150
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,658
Brew this herbal drink for me

151
00:08:15,761 --> 00:08:16,022
Yes

152
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,060
Collecting money?

153
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,323
I've been to Xuzhou

154
00:08:18,898 --> 00:08:19,455
Got it all?

155
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:20,623
Give that to me, boss

156
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:21,893
Of course not

157
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:27,035
I'm going to freshen up and lie down,
don't forget

158
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,128
I won't

159
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:32,801
Be careful when you open your mouth
next time

160
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,004
...or I'll slap you

161
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:36,240
Come on, it's an accident

162
00:08:36,349 --> 00:08:37,816
If something happens to you one day...

163
00:08:37,917 --> 00:08:39,976
What do you mean?

164
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:43,453
Forget about what I said,
thanks for your pen

165
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,121
Go to hell

166
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:09,648
What now?

167
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,141
Lawyer Diao...

168
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:12,274
Sorry

169
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:15,479
Would have spat on you
if you were someone else

170
00:10:23,723 --> 00:10:25,884
I want to buy a chamber pot

171
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,323
Too big. Another one

172
00:10:36,035 --> 00:10:37,297
Pick yourself

173
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:48,439
That's for kids

174
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:49,946
It's all right

175
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,949
Sorry...

176
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:02,879
I want to learn

177
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:10,426
What's with you? Are you mad?

178
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:20,209
I'm mad...

179
00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:08,991
See you

180
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,513
Damn cat

181
00:19:47,319 --> 00:19:48,308
Damn it

182
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,084
Where're you going?

183
00:19:52,724 --> 00:19:53,952
Asshole, stop running

184
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,660
Who's that?

185
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,191
Zhang

186
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:06,863
Help me,
the boss is getting suspicious again

187
00:20:06,972 --> 00:20:08,269
Or he'll beat me up

188
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,032
I can't take it

189
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:09,732
What happened?

190
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:10,603
Don't ask

191
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,335
Take this

192
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:13,843
Go over to my bed in a while

193
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,413
No matter what the boss does

194
00:20:15,514 --> 00:20:17,243
Keep your mouth shut

195
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:17,781
Then...

196
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:19,009
Just go

197
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:46,508
Asshole

198
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,012
I'll kill you, bitch

199
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,184
Beat you up good

200
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,385
Bitch

201
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:09,228
Bastard, I'll tell your mom about this

202
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:26,914
What're you doing? Come to bed

203
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,878
You go ahead

204
00:21:33,525 --> 00:21:35,493
I'm itchy, scratch me

205
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:44,362
A little higher

206
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:55,676
Lower

207
00:21:57,716 --> 00:21:59,911
That's it

208
00:22:04,356 --> 00:22:05,823
So comfortable

209
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,634
Come on, Dachui

210
00:22:19,971 --> 00:22:20,596
Open up...

211
00:22:20,706 --> 00:22:21,673
Coming...

212
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,176
What's going on? It's late

213
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:28,007
He said you're cheating on him

214
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,013
And that he's beaten you up

215
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:31,082
Cut your hair

216
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:32,706
What hair?

217
00:22:33,118 --> 00:22:35,018
Whose hair?

218
00:22:37,122 --> 00:22:38,749
Tell me

219
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:40,955
Whose hair is this?

220
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:41,749
Unbelievable

221
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,690
What're you looking at?

222
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:46,196
I think it's the other way round

223
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:48,459
Whose hair is this?

224
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,901
Whose?

225
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:52,761
I'm asking you

226
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:53,701
Stop the act

227
00:22:53,805 --> 00:22:55,397
You said that you beat me up

228
00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,441
Where're the bruises?

229
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,407
Yes, you can't unnecessarily accuse her

230
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:00,808
Sister, mom is worried

231
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:03,278
She'll hang herself if this was true

232
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,715
You accused me of cheating

233
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,615
And you complained to my mother?

234
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,255
How can I face people now?

235
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:14,120
Stop it, sister

236
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,921
Don't try to stop me

237
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:17,892
No, sister

238
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,000
Look at him

239
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:32,770
I don't know who he's with

240
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:35,438
Red string on his toe

241
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:38,481
You're not unlucky...

242
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:40,547
I'm unlucky

243
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:44,055
You've a piece of red string on your toe

244
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,555
And wish your wife
to have an affair too!

245
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:49,718
Well said

246
00:23:49,828 --> 00:23:52,991
You know what's going on

247
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,065
Be careful

248
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:54,996
You better be careful

249
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,568
Yes, I will get my proof next time

250
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:02,564
Your husband is full of nonsense

251
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:04,767
Our family is not going to be
bullied around

252
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:08,573
What's there to listen, huh?

253
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:34,371
Send out the goods to Xuzhou
on the day after

254
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:35,599
And for the goods to Suzhou

255
00:24:35,707 --> 00:24:37,174
Better work on those soon

256
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:42,436
How long will you be away?

257
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:44,181
10 to 15 days

258
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:46,273
Take care of things

259
00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:47,243
Don't worry

260
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:48,614
Mr. Tao, going away on trip?

261
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,051
Yes

262
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:34,324
Is he here?

263
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,290
Yes

264
00:27:32,183 --> 00:27:34,014
What have you got to say now?

265
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,950
What's going on?

266
00:27:47,799 --> 00:27:49,266
Tie it up

267
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:53,661
Hurry, think of something

268
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:55,098
How could he do that to me?

269
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,169
He deserves to die

270
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:59,175
You're his wife

271
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:00,869
You must try to save him

272
00:28:00,979 --> 00:28:01,604
He's now tied with that bitch

273
00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:03,613
...inside the sack

274
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:06,915
Get Lawyer Diao to think of a plan

275
00:28:16,227 --> 00:28:18,252
What do you want? It's late

276
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:19,560
Yours?

277
00:28:19,831 --> 00:28:21,765
Carry it inside

278
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,593
Go

279
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:31,532
Think of a good plan

280
00:28:31,643 --> 00:28:32,405
which can save Mr. Wang

281
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:34,569
And also save my lady boss

282
00:28:36,915 --> 00:28:38,314
A good plan?

283
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:50,919
Got it

284
00:28:53,398 --> 00:28:55,889
Leave now, I'll take care of it

285
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,333
Great, thanks

286
00:29:12,784 --> 00:29:13,876
Strip

287
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:15,545
Go on, take off the clothes

288
00:29:16,821 --> 00:29:18,482
We've got to do what we got to do

289
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:20,854
I'm thinking here

290
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,688
And you must do your part

291
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,052
Why do you want me to strip?

292
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,097
We don't have much time now

293
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:28,631
Otherwise they won't be saved

294
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:35,338
Then... I won't be able to help

295
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,411
Fine...

296
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:42,502
It's not that hard, is it?

297
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,088
Turn your head away

298
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:53,387
I want to watch

299
00:30:27,525 --> 00:30:28,651
Lie down

300
00:30:34,899 --> 00:30:35,923
Don't get this wrong

301
00:30:36,301 --> 00:30:37,859
We have to leave some proof

302
00:30:38,203 --> 00:30:39,261
Of what?

303
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:41,696
That we've had intercourse

304
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:45,666
Now you get it

305
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,779
Your honour

306
00:31:00,024 --> 00:31:00,888
Bring in the prisoners

307
00:31:00,992 --> 00:31:05,326
Bring in Wang Chenglong, Mrs. Tao

308
00:31:19,844 --> 00:31:21,368
The adulterers are here

309
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:22,969
I've been wronged...

310
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:23,911
Silence...

311
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:26,776
Open it

312
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:27,783
Yes

313
00:31:33,157 --> 00:31:35,591
I've been wronged...

314
00:31:35,693 --> 00:31:38,594
Judge, I've been wronged...

315
00:31:43,134 --> 00:31:44,123
Wang Chenglong

316
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:45,432
Here

317
00:31:46,704 --> 00:31:48,501
Mrs. Tao

318
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:50,206
Mrs. Tao

319
00:31:50,308 --> 00:31:51,332
Here

320
00:31:54,445 --> 00:31:55,343
Over here

321
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:04,419
Judge

322
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:06,618
Are you Mrs. Tao?

323
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:07,520
Yes

324
00:32:08,793 --> 00:32:10,488
Then who's she?

325
00:32:10,895 --> 00:32:12,726
Wang Chenglong's wife

326
00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:15,393
Wang Chenglong

327
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,564
Is she your wife?

328
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:21,265
Yes, my wife. Her maiden name is Zhou

329
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:23,598
We were asleep at home

330
00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:26,067
I'm not sure what we had done
to offend Mr. Tao

331
00:32:26,177 --> 00:32:29,578
Mr. Tao came in and tied us up

332
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:32,013
Tao Sanxing, what do you call this?

333
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,716
This... it's all so baffling!

334
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,186
Phew! You're the one who's baffling

335
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:39,523
Your honour

336
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:42,149
He accused me of having an affair
a few days ago

337
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,318
He made a scene at my mother's house

338
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:44,952
Summoned my brothers

339
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,758
Sir, he's a neurotic

340
00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,456
He has always been suspicious

341
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,363
Tao Sanxing will get...

342
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,629
forty strokes of cane

343
00:32:52,737 --> 00:32:53,669
Yes

344
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:54,669
End of case

345
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,074
Please count

346
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:05,638
It's fine

347
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,048
We're not in it for money

348
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,512
I know

349
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:12,748
Thanks

350
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:17,126
I've told you to leave

351
00:33:17,228 --> 00:33:18,456
I...

352
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:27,395
This can't be?

353
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,233
Why not?

354
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,931
We had a deal

355
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:32,100
And you don't have to pay us

356
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:34,469
Your wife will. Isn't that great?

357
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:35,546
I mean...

358
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:37,079
Just go...

359
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:55,122
Which one of you wants to go first?

360
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:57,324
Come on

361
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,029
You go ahead

362
00:34:00,138 --> 00:34:01,799
You're taller. After you

363
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:04,568
You're older, after you

364
00:34:04,675 --> 00:34:06,267
Go on, please

365
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:08,777
The elder first, please

366
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,744
- No...
- You first

367
00:34:09,847 --> 00:34:11,314
- No...
- Please

368
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:14,245
You two figure it out

369
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:15,376
I'll go first

370
00:34:18,456 --> 00:34:20,754
Then I'm off

371
00:34:20,858 --> 00:34:22,485
Please

372
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:52,350
"Be a good civil servant"

373
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:55,518
And then what happened?

374
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,225
My husband was angry when he got home

375
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,622
Then he fell sick and died

376
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:02,490
What happened to Wang Dachui's wife?

377
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:05,195
She's working here too

378
00:35:05,303 --> 00:35:06,770
Really? What's her name?

379
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:09,063
What's on your mind?

380
00:35:09,173 --> 00:35:10,834
Waiter...

381
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:12,307
Coming...

382
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,005
Where's Yindi?

383
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:16,239
She'll be right here

384
00:35:16,347 --> 00:35:16,745
Go look for her

385
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:18,145
Yes...

386
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:22,118
Big...

387
00:35:22,220 --> 00:35:23,915
How's your luck today?

388
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:27,718
Hurry

389
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:29,650
Coming...

390
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:32,558
Come on, the customer's waiting

391
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:33,425
Let him wait

392
00:35:33,531 --> 00:35:34,498
He can take care of himself

393
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:35,793
Come on

394
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,559
I'll be right back

395
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:37,827
Go...

396
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:39,968
Coming...

397
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:40,935
So annoying!

398
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,172
It's you?

399
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:46,674
Peiqin

400
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,173
Cousin Erhu

401
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:51,371
Peiqin

402
00:35:51,482 --> 00:35:52,312
Cousin Erhu

403
00:35:52,416 --> 00:35:54,441
How have you been?

404
00:35:54,852 --> 00:35:56,183
Are they treating you well?

405
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,555
How did you get out?

406
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:00,785
I sneaked out

407
00:36:00,892 --> 00:36:01,722
How?

408
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,056
They'll catch you

409
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:06,491
No big deal

410
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:10,767
I'll take my chances in order to see you

411
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:13,003
So sweet!

412
00:36:17,508 --> 00:36:19,066
What are you doing?

413
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,542
Don't feign ignorance; Go

414
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:22,943
Go back to where you belong

415
00:36:23,047 --> 00:36:23,775
Let go of me...

416
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:25,075
Go

417
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:25,649
Peiqin

418
00:36:25,750 --> 00:36:26,842
Cousin Erhu

419
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:28,550
Let go of me...

420
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:29,950
Cousin Erhu

421
00:36:30,054 --> 00:36:30,816
Peiqin

422
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32,116
Cousin Erhu

423
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:32,951
Peiqin

424
00:36:33,057 --> 00:36:33,955
Cousin Erhu

425
00:36:34,058 --> 00:36:35,252
Don't worry, Peiqin

426
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,621
I'll come back for you

427
00:36:36,727 --> 00:36:37,751
Cousin Erhu

428
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,124
Let go of me...

429
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:41,027
Cousin Erhu

430
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:41,621
Peiqin

431
00:36:41,732 --> 00:36:43,529
Cousin Erhu

432
00:36:44,669 --> 00:36:46,034
Cousin Erhu

433
00:36:53,711 --> 00:36:54,735
Let's check on her

434
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:01,810
What's going on? Who's he?

435
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:07,580
My cousin, Fan Erhu

436
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:09,117
Your cousin?

437
00:37:12,863 --> 00:37:14,990
I was engaged to him since we were little

438
00:37:15,633 --> 00:37:17,692
Then my father opted for wealth

439
00:37:17,802 --> 00:37:19,201
He married me off to the Gao family

440
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:22,132
To a husband who's 10 years my junior

441
00:37:37,655 --> 00:37:38,679
Yuzhu

442
00:37:39,457 --> 00:37:40,321
Father

443
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:48,031
What are you doing?

444
00:37:48,132 --> 00:37:51,260
You're about to get married
and start a family

445
00:37:51,369 --> 00:37:53,997
How could you behave like a child?

446
00:37:54,839 --> 00:37:55,965
What kind of a person will you turn into?

447
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:57,934
The young master is about to be a groom

448
00:37:58,042 --> 00:37:59,566
I think he's just very happy about it

449
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:02,043
Father, I asked him to play with me

450
00:38:02,146 --> 00:38:03,238
Shut up

451
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,380
Come with me

452
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:14,157
You're about to get married...

453
00:38:14,258 --> 00:38:15,657
and start a family

454
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,193
Bouncing around whole day

455
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:20,128
So childish! This just isn't done

456
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:21,658
Yuzhu

457
00:38:23,067 --> 00:38:26,059
After one gets married,
one gets along well...

458
00:38:26,170 --> 00:38:29,264
with the in-laws and starts a family

459
00:38:31,876 --> 00:38:35,403
The day after tomorrow is your wedding

460
00:38:36,047 --> 00:38:38,777
The Hans are a respectable family

461
00:38:38,883 --> 00:38:41,579
A family of scholars

462
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:45,153
Miss Peiqin is a learned lady

463
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,753
She's twenty four

464
00:38:47,858 --> 00:38:52,852
24? She's a year older than
my seventh mom

465
00:38:52,963 --> 00:38:54,157
Nonsense

466
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:58,360
Master, the virility supplement is ready

467
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:02,029
What did Mrs. Ke say?

468
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,432
She'll be here soon

469
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:09,108
Mrs. Ke is a well-informed lady

470
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,616
That's why I invited her here. I mean,

471
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:15,950
to teach you about the bedroom etiquette

472
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:18,251
You must pay attention

473
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,450
Mrs. Ke is teaching the young master
about sex?

474
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:25,187
And see if he's ready to have sex yet

475
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,059
Have sex? Of course I can

476
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:28,722
I've just tried it with Yuzhen

477
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:29,800
What?

478
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:32,598
Jumping on the ground

479
00:39:33,437 --> 00:39:35,632
That's not what it is

480
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,402
Simply ridiculous

481
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:41,000
You should be more careful

482
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:42,670
If we don't teach him properly,
then he'll...

483
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,682
make a fool of himself in front of Ms Han

484
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:49,275
She'll of course forgive him

485
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:52,779
Master, you said that Mrs. Ke can tell

486
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,380
whether the young master's ready or not

487
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:55,823
She said she can...

488
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:03,126
Around the neck once

489
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:07,133
Put this in half

490
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,900
Measure from the nose to the ear

491
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:13,101
He's ready if it passes the ear

492
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,541
Otherwise...

493
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,545
He'll have to postpone his wedding

494
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,174
...to a later date

495
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:24,587
Emperor Guangxu
became sexually active too young

496
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:26,679
That's why he was impotent

497
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:28,757
It's recorded in the book?

498
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,591
Absolutely

499
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:32,753
The Emperor Guangxu...

500
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:34,728
had four sex education teachers

501
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:36,800
One of them was my Third auntie

502
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:38,391
Another my fourth auntie

503
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:49,735
Unbelievable! Is he really 8 years old?

504
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,439
Like father, like son

505
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,884
Right, you have a good name

506
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:03,187
Gao Tiande, meaning the blessed one

507
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:05,893
Congratulations! I think...

508
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:08,829
you will have a grandson within one year

509
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,037
He's a naughty boy

510
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:19,908
Let's see how good the teacher is

511
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,170
That's not fair

512
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:24,145
Teacher can teach,
but the student must learn

513
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:27,909
An accomplished pupil
must have a good mentor

514
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:31,112
We don't have to go into this

515
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:34,658
Man's lust for food and sex is natural

516
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:38,657
Nothing can be excessive... especially sex

517
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:42,698
that involves staying healthy
and birth control

518
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,701
There are certain dates

519
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:48,704
I mean... during the year

520
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:51,468
There're 101 days
you can't have intercourse

521
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:54,169
Then during First day of Spring

522
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:57,338
First day of Autumn

523
00:41:57,448 --> 00:42:00,246
Summer solstice, winter solstice

524
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,911
And on a few particular festivals

525
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,011
During the middle of a month;
all these days

526
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:07,090
you must refrain from having intercourse

527
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:09,983
Remember...
or you'll suffer when you're old

528
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:12,619
You'll be in pain, coughing all the time

529
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,362
Do you agree?

530
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:20,332
All right

531
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:29,940
Let's begin

532
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:32,647
Let's start

533
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,775
Please start, Mrs. Ke

534
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:44,693
Sorry?

535
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:46,357
Please start

536
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:48,996
You want to listen too?

537
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,028
Sorry, this lesson is meant as one-to-one

538
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:54,764
No third party

539
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:57,064
I understand

540
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,241
Gao Ming, Gao Ma, leave us

541
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:09,178
You too

542
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:11,720
Sorry

543
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:13,084
No problem

544
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,243
What are you doing? Get up

545
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,136
What were you thinking?

546
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:39,509
Sex, of course

547
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:40,641
Pardon?

548
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,817
Hey, are you mad?

549
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:48,017
With you?

550
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:52,554
Silly brat

551
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:56,928
Get up, get dressed

552
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:00,366
What then?

553
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:06,369
Theories and the terms first

554
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,539
You aren't ready...

555
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:09,874
for the real thing yet

556
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:13,772
Look at this

557
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:18,176
Done?

558
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:23,150
This represents your willy

559
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:29,593
My willy? What willy?

560
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,299
Your peepee

561
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:33,736
My...

562
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:41,709
My peepee is called a "willy"

563
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,944
Then what does your peepee go by?

564
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:44,844
Ridiculous

565
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:47,014
Ridiculous

566
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:48,875
No

567
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:53,283
Listen, Miss Han is so learned

568
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,592
Remember to be civilized

569
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,889
You can't say peepee or willy

570
00:44:58,996 --> 00:44:59,894
What then?

571
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:03,896
There're many ways to call it

572
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,696
Just observe the proper etiquette

573
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:09,838
Not the prick, too vulgar

574
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,134
The penis

575
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:14,433
Or the member

576
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:15,938
Member of what?

577
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,638
Not that kind of member

578
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,447
The member

579
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,517
The member

580
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:22,343
The private part

581
00:45:22,453 --> 00:45:23,442
The private part

582
00:45:24,088 --> 00:45:25,385
The Phallus

583
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:26,183
Phallus

584
00:45:26,290 --> 00:45:27,780
Genitals

585
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:28,619
Genitals

586
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,354
Pecker

587
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:33,362
Pecker

588
00:45:34,264 --> 00:45:35,094
Got it?

589
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:36,257
Got it

590
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:37,060
Have you memorized?

591
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:38,134
Yep

592
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,669
Let's repeat

593
00:45:41,605 --> 00:45:43,630
This is called...

594
00:45:45,175 --> 00:45:48,201
A...

595
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:49,370
What?

596
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:50,879
Handkerchief

597
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,561
Dayu, Mrs. Ke is teaching

598
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:07,152
Keep quiet, leave

599
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:10,763
The male has 5 principles;
& the female- 5 desires

600
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:12,062
You must practise sex correctly

601
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:13,932
Only then can both partners benefit

602
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:16,369
Although there are many styles

603
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:18,771
Most well known
being the 9 ancient styles

604
00:46:19,143 --> 00:46:22,840
Dragon, Tiger, Ape

605
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:27,007
Cicada, Turtle, Rabbit

606
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:31,383
Phoenix, Fish and Crane

607
00:46:31,989 --> 00:46:36,653
At your age, just go with the flow

608
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:44,229
Male is Yang, female is Yin

609
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:46,564
Heaven is Yang, earth is Yin

610
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,763
Sun is Yang, moon is yin

611
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:52,103
After you're married pay your respects...

612
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:56,771
to the gods
before you engage in intercourse

613
00:46:58,015 --> 00:46:59,642
The heaven is above, earth below

614
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:01,115
The sun is above, moon below

615
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:03,948
You're on top, Miss Han under

616
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:08,081
Otherwise you'll be hurting yourself

617
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:09,921
Really?

618
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:10,857
Yes

619
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:12,458
Oh no!

620
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:13,552
What?

621
00:47:14,131 --> 00:47:15,462
Dayu has done it wrong

622
00:47:15,566 --> 00:47:17,090
Who's Dayu?

623
00:47:17,801 --> 00:47:19,860
The Seventh aunt's maid

624
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:20,902
What has she done?

625
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:26,640
She's on top every time!

626
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:37,184
Here's the bride

627
00:47:58,475 --> 00:48:00,204
Zhang, get the fire pan

628
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:01,402
Coming...

629
00:48:01,511 --> 00:48:01,977
Hurry

630
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:02,443
Hurry

631
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,672
Coming...

632
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:14,182
Over the fire, blessed with children

633
00:48:26,637 --> 00:48:29,834
Over the saddle,
blessed with lots of gold

634
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,184
To bear children soon

635
00:48:44,288 --> 00:48:45,880
Longans

636
00:48:46,223 --> 00:48:48,418
Lychees

637
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:51,922
Happily together ever after

638
00:48:58,869 --> 00:48:59,699
Congratulations

639
00:48:59,803 --> 00:49:01,293
All the very best

640
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:04,400
A happy occasion indeed

641
00:49:06,610 --> 00:49:08,077
Congratulations

642
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:18,180
Eat up

643
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:58,226
So? Not done?

644
00:49:59,062 --> 00:50:00,290
It's hot

645
00:50:03,934 --> 00:50:05,094
Not done yet

646
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:11,703
Bride, yes?

647
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,137
How?

648
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,719
Congratulations

649
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:36,061
You'll have a grandson next year

650
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:38,091
Let's go

651
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:38,599
Yes

652
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:39,293
Come on

653
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:40,836
I'm going too

654
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:13,801
Let's go over there

655
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,156
Quiet

656
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:48,004
Heaven on top, earth below

657
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,936
Sun on top, moon below

658
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,504
I'm on top, you're below

659
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:06,856
Keep quiet

660
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:11,525
One sound and I'll kill you. Get down

661
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:24,967
Don't!

662
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:32,107
No...

663
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:37,485
Please

664
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:40,481
No...

665
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:43,320
My name is Fan Erhu

666
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:44,518
I'm her cousin

667
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,027
We were engaged since we were little

668
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:50,129
Her father opted for wealth

669
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:55,603
You were just a kid

670
00:52:56,573 --> 00:53:00,134
Tonight is our wedding night

671
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:02,604
You sit still

672
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,541
If you make a sound

673
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,708
Blood will be on my dagger

674
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:10,111
You understand?

675
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,197
Hu

676
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:26,300
Hu? Who's that?

677
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,665
As strong as a tiger

678
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:40,912
Heaven on top, earth below

679
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:43,212
Sun on top, moon below

680
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:52,594
I'm not on top, you're on top;
how absurd!

681
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:01,934
I'm impressed

682
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,079
You'll have a grandson next year

683
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:14,650
You're a good teacher

684
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:15,911
Of what good is that?

685
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:18,146
Your son outshines you

686
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:31,265
Harmful to your health!

687
00:54:39,976 --> 00:54:42,069
It's breakfast time,
young master and lady

688
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:44,043
It's time for breakfast

689
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:45,875
Young master

690
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:46,880
Who is it?

691
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:48,479
It's time for breakfast

692
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:51,820
Ask them to leave the food outside

693
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:58,325
They said to leave the food outside

694
00:54:58,428 --> 00:54:59,053
They?

695
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:00,356
I heard a man's voice

696
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:01,521
Why's that?

697
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:06,593
Master, it's almost noon

698
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:07,670
You should get up

699
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:09,570
Again

700
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:14,306
Young master, young lady

701
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:15,672
Coming...

702
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:20,574
Morning, young lady

703
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,849
The master's still asleep, let me

704
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:33,124
Young master

705
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:33,991
Dayu

706
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:35,161
Young master

707
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:36,197
Get out

708
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:41,396
I'll beat him if you don't leave.
Now scram

709
00:55:42,138 --> 00:55:43,833
Just get out

710
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:45,863
Out

711
00:55:45,975 --> 00:55:47,169
Yes

712
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:48,609
What did you say?

713
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:50,236
They tied up the young master?

714
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,212
What should we do now?

715
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:53,714
Master, we must be careful

716
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:55,876
They have the young master
as their hostage

717
00:55:58,988 --> 00:55:59,977
Call the police...

718
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:04,518
Come on

719
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:09,990
Get them out now

720
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:12,657
Or I'll kill him

721
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:19,470
Dad...

722
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:24,471
Everyone, let's talk over there...

723
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:34,387
Cousin Erhu

724
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:36,015
Don't worry

725
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:40,296
They treat us terribly

726
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:42,054
We'll do the same

727
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:44,962
Now that they're worried

728
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:48,504
We should just enjoy ourselves, come on

729
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:57,947
Tell them to give up

730
00:56:58,047 --> 00:57:00,140
Or Han Peiqin's parents
will get the cane too

731
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,012
Yes

732
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:06,685
Go on then

733
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:09,115
They're the ones getting the cane

734
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:11,384
If they really love me

735
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:13,758
They wouldn't have married me here

736
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:16,660
40 strokes of cane?!

737
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:19,326
Even 80 won't suffice

738
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,107
Sir, then...

739
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,908
Look

740
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:33,141
Shut up

741
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:07,667
Shut up, little ass

742
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:16,439
A pair of animals

743
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:22,113
Animals?

744
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:29,992
Then what happened?

745
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,894
Cousin Erhu got caned 100 strokes

746
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:36,256
Sentenced to life in prison

747
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:39,064
Do you know
who's my first customer here?

748
01:00:39,168 --> 01:00:40,100
Who?

749
01:00:40,203 --> 01:00:40,828
Tell us

750
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:42,495
The judge for my case

751
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:45,106
Morals and virtues; bloody hypocrites!

752
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:46,402
They are the ones who are the worst

753
01:00:47,043 --> 01:00:49,204
I heard you've left our line of work

754
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,301
What are you doing back here again?

755
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:53,679
Back here again?

756
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:57,152
I've been in and out of this place thrice

757
01:00:57,353 --> 01:00:58,115
Three times?

758
01:00:58,521 --> 01:01:01,752
I was married to a pawn shop owner once

759
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:03,826
We separated because of a tree

760
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:04,984
A tree?

761
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:05,856
A tree

762
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:09,191
A tree of sin

763
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,230
It was actually a pear tree

764
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,433
Just like any other tree

765
01:01:16,105 --> 01:01:20,906
It grows normally

766
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:22,802
Deng Hongfa knew that

767
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:24,743
...the tree was unique

768
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:27,876
Mr. Deng opened a pawn shop

769
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:31,511
He's a well known miser, quite well off

770
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:34,556
His hobbies include Taichi,
keeping birds as pets

771
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,695
In order to feed his birds...

772
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:52,798
He often looked for grasshoppers
in the garden

773
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:24,262
The story regarding the tree of sin

774
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:27,206
happened one day when Deng Hongfa

775
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:29,840
...looked down from the tree

776
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:32,107
Everyone under the tree appeared naked

777
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,982
But it's all normal
when not seen from the tree

778
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,784
He put up a notice on the tree

779
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:39,548
No climbing

780
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:44,090
Actually it's my trick

781
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:52,829
Are you hungry?

782
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:56,035
Hungry?

783
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:08,713
Comfortable?

784
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:10,080
Yes

785
01:03:14,857 --> 01:03:17,087
After his first wife passed away

786
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:18,353
...I took her place

787
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:30,868
The old man is quite young at heart

788
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:33,304
But he's lousy in bed

789
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:37,672
My maid Xiaoyu acted as my go-between

790
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:40,715
There're plenty of young guys in the shop

791
01:03:42,885 --> 01:03:43,817
Xiaocai

792
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:57,664
Madam

793
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:01,529
What?

794
01:04:02,872 --> 01:04:05,363
Xiaocai said a sailor pawned his wife

795
01:04:05,474 --> 01:04:06,441
Pawned his wife?

796
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:08,000
How?

797
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:09,304
One who doesn't need to be fed

798
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:11,039
...and who never gets jealous

799
01:04:11,147 --> 01:04:12,978
That's ridiculous

800
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:14,982
It's been written in books

801
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:16,574
They are made for the sailors

802
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,881
Made from rubber, called puppet wife

803
01:04:18,988 --> 01:04:21,821
When you blow it up,
it becomes a life size doll

804
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:23,818
I want to take a look

805
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,262
Xiaocai

806
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:35,633
Yes?

807
01:04:35,905 --> 01:04:38,066
I heard a sailor pawned a rubber doll

808
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:39,835
Yes, anything is possible

809
01:04:39,942 --> 01:04:41,034
I want to take a look

810
01:04:41,644 --> 01:04:43,669
What? I better safe keep it

811
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:45,542
Otherwise you young lads

812
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:48,014
...will steal it and ruin it

813
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:50,043
It's all wrapped up

814
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:51,949
The boss is mean, no one would dare

815
01:04:52,321 --> 01:04:54,619
Yes, maybe for the others

816
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:57,858
I mean, you ain'tjust stealing
the rubber doll!

817
01:04:58,227 --> 01:04:59,285
Quick, let me see

818
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:00,987
Okay, come with me

819
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:20,041
Hurry

820
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:41,461
I'll get it

821
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:00,384
It's horrible!

822
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:01,622
How could it be compared to you?

823
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:03,817
Sailors spend most of their time onboard

824
01:06:03,926 --> 01:06:06,087
Well, something is better than nothing

825
01:06:06,195 --> 01:06:09,062
Anyone will do when one is desperate

826
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:42,356
Almost

827
01:06:47,236 --> 01:06:48,260
Done

828
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:55,742
Stop it

829
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:29,508
Xiaocai has been acting strange lately

830
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:30,579
He can't focus on his work

831
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:33,913
Do you know why?

832
01:07:34,417 --> 01:07:35,816
Not focused?

833
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:39,180
I haven't noticed

834
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:40,983
Of course you haven't

835
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:43,048
These few days whenever he sees me...

836
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:44,717
He's been acting very sneaky

837
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,289
I think he's up to no good

838
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:49,793
Xiaocai has been working for
over 6 years now

839
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:54,794
One must protect his own interests first

840
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:57,666
You take over his job starting tomorrow

841
01:07:58,974 --> 01:08:00,373
Me...

842
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:03,274
Send him to manage the front desk

843
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:04,573
Then we'll see after a few months

844
01:08:05,114 --> 01:08:07,309
I'll get him
to pass you the keys tomorrow

845
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:08,849
I've got my own set of keys

846
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:10,475
You must be responsible

847
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:11,245
I...

848
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:13,287
Remember

849
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:16,886
You must be loyal to me and the company

850
01:08:17,693 --> 01:08:19,524
I'll test you from time to time

851
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:22,924
If you're loyal, you'll be rewarded

852
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:24,431
If not...

853
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:30,404
You trust me

854
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:31,803
Of course I'll be loyal

855
01:08:31,907 --> 01:08:33,738
That's good to know

856
01:08:35,644 --> 01:08:36,838
Follow me

857
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:01,596
Practise first

858
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:04,434
You'll get used to it

859
01:09:05,007 --> 01:09:06,372
...once you gain more experience

860
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:09,400
Pay attention to details, work seriously

861
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:10,706
Most important is being loyal

862
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:12,144
Yes...

863
01:09:29,431 --> 01:09:30,830
You

864
01:09:30,933 --> 01:09:33,060
No wonder you've been
acting strange lately

865
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:35,262
You're sleeping with someone here?

866
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:39,001
A customer pawned this,
I'm just trying it out

867
01:09:39,308 --> 01:09:40,935
Trying it out?

868
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:42,510
You'll ruin it,
can you pay for the damages?

869
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:44,238
I was... just curious

870
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:47,140
Curious! What kind of excuse is that?

871
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:48,880
Why don't you just find a woman?

872
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:20,746
Clean it up right away

873
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:22,982
Send it to my room tonight

874
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:26,718
Right, starting tomorrow

875
01:10:26,822 --> 01:10:28,289
Pass the keys to Guo Zixiang

876
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:30,148
You work on the front desk

877
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:32,227
He'll take over, got it?

878
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:33,491
Yes, boss

879
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:35,990
Go

880
01:10:43,505 --> 01:10:44,472
Xiaoyu

881
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:56,911
Where were you?

882
01:10:57,019 --> 01:10:58,213
I've been looking for you everywhere

883
01:10:58,621 --> 01:10:59,713
I was right here

884
01:11:01,156 --> 01:11:02,248
Cook some ginseng soup for me

885
01:11:02,358 --> 01:11:03,256
I'm busy

886
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:03,984
What?

887
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:05,321
The madam has asked me
to run some errands

888
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:06,052
What kind of errands?

889
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:07,185
Buying dried melon seeds

890
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:20,834
What kind of attitude was that?

891
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:23,710
Come along...

892
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:26,676
Let's play mahjong

893
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:28,511
We are very lucky

894
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:31,017
You're in a good mood today

895
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:33,116
For business
one has got to be in good spirits

896
01:11:33,222 --> 01:11:34,780
You'll make more
when you're in a good mood

897
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:37,324
24 rounds are too much, 8 are too little

898
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:38,757
12 rounds is fine

899
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:42,192
Go ahead, I'll go check on the books

900
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:44,856
I hope you'll win more, dear

901
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:59,138
You should treat us today,
you are promoted

902
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:00,215
Right...

903
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:02,443
The madam should treat us today

904
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:04,041
The boss loves her so much

905
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:05,916
Goes without saying!
When he loves her...

906
01:12:06,021 --> 01:12:07,886
she will be nicer to him too

907
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:10,420
As for my husband, the most...

908
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:12,687
he loves his moustache,
his pet birds the second

909
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:14,092
His teeth the third

910
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:17,661
He doesn't take me seriously though

911
01:12:17,766 --> 01:12:19,165
...unless he needs a favor

912
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:30,745
I win

913
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,038
Didn't expect you to win!

914
01:12:33,415 --> 01:12:34,712
Just going with the flow

915
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:36,751
Good going! You're cool

916
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:38,982
Where is the White Dragon?

917
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:42,156
You're trying to be elusive but anyhow...

918
01:12:42,891 --> 01:12:44,586
I still adore you

919
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:53,891
Be loyal, I'll test you from time to time

920
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:07,176
Xiaoyu, you take my place

921
01:14:29,097 --> 01:14:31,793
I'll get even today

922
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:44,907
Xiaoyu, your small nose and small eyes

923
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:53,346
What a lovely face

924
01:14:59,294 --> 01:15:01,990
You're a good girl, lying down so still

925
01:15:02,097 --> 01:15:03,291
So submissive

926
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:05,993
I'm going to show you what I've got

927
01:15:11,807 --> 01:15:19,111
Such a pretty face

928
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:24,316
Take a closer look, I'm your wife

929
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:39,762
Well? Yes or no?

930
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:41,495
Must have cost you a fortune

931
01:15:41,603 --> 01:15:44,197
Yes, if you like it...

932
01:15:44,406 --> 01:15:45,236
you may have it

933
01:15:45,474 --> 01:15:47,066
Are you teasing me? This is from you?

934
01:15:47,442 --> 01:15:48,568
Of course not

935
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:50,577
The madam gave this to you

936
01:15:50,679 --> 01:15:51,737
The madam?

937
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:54,475
A gift for your promotion

938
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:56,081
Really?

939
01:15:56,351 --> 01:15:57,340
Why would I lie to you?

940
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:02,752
You'd feel uneasy
when you've received a gift

941
01:16:03,525 --> 01:16:04,457
...which you know you don't deserve

942
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,256
So you should do your part, agree?

943
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:09,227
My part? What part?

944
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:11,595
The boss is going away

945
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:12,997
...for a short trip

946
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:15,194
Madam will be bored alone

947
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:17,534
Why don't you accompany her tonight?

948
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:20,540
To do what? Play mahjong?

949
01:16:20,876 --> 01:16:23,344
You and her together

950
01:16:23,845 --> 01:16:26,336
Do what? Play chess?

951
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:28,177
I don't know how

952
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:30,843
There're plenty of things you could do

953
01:16:30,953 --> 01:16:32,113
Notjust playing chess

954
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:33,346
When the door is closed...

955
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:34,717
You can do whatever you want

956
01:16:34,823 --> 01:16:37,758
No one would care

957
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:46,691
I've got it

958
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:51,800
At least you're not stupid

959
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:54,333
The boss sent you to test me, right?

960
01:16:56,645 --> 01:16:57,703
Test you?

961
01:16:58,981 --> 01:17:00,141
For what?

962
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:02,039
My loyalty

963
01:17:05,854 --> 01:17:07,515
You thought I don't know?

964
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:10,018
You're unbelievable

965
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:11,183
What are you talking about?

966
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:13,227
You should know madam's nature

967
01:17:13,328 --> 01:17:16,263
Am I the type of person to do
such a thing?

968
01:17:16,365 --> 01:17:17,332
That's so wrong of you

969
01:17:17,432 --> 01:17:20,924
I believe you,
I don't want you to get into trouble

970
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:23,331
If the madam is serious about it

971
01:17:23,438 --> 01:17:24,700
I've a problem for her to solve

972
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:26,171
What problem?

973
01:17:26,274 --> 01:17:27,935
She must prove that
the boss isn't testing me

974
01:17:28,043 --> 01:17:30,807
First, kill one of the boss' birds

975
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:31,401
Why?

976
01:17:31,513 --> 01:17:32,775
Then

977
01:17:32,881 --> 01:17:34,746
Pluck out three hairs of his moustache

978
01:17:35,017 --> 01:17:35,779
He hasn't got many

979
01:17:35,884 --> 01:17:38,853
Lastly... take out one of his teeth

980
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:41,448
Fine if you're not interested

981
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:43,552
You think you're the last man on earth?

982
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:44,819
She will give up now

983
01:17:44,926 --> 01:17:46,757
And you won't be caught in the middle

984
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:53,327
No big deal

985
01:17:53,435 --> 01:17:56,871
When there's a will, there's a way

986
01:17:56,972 --> 01:17:58,906
Tell him to wait and see

987
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:06,644
Xiaoyu

988
01:18:06,748 --> 01:18:07,305
Yes?

989
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:08,474
Come here

990
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:09,447
I'm busy

991
01:18:11,787 --> 01:18:12,685
I'm busy

992
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:28,025
You're a champ

993
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:37,870
I love my moustache

994
01:18:38,146 --> 01:18:41,377
Dense & thick. Great, isn't it!

995
01:18:44,419 --> 01:18:45,386
Look at you

996
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:56,424
One can have anything except sickness

997
01:18:56,898 --> 01:19:00,026
One can do without anything
except money

998
01:19:00,702 --> 01:19:04,194
Yes, you're quite a man

999
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:06,706
Rich, healthy

1000
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:08,704
What's so unusual about it?

1001
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:12,642
People at my age...

1002
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:14,573
don't have the sturdy teeth I have

1003
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:15,982
I'm not bluffing

1004
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:18,715
I've never been to a dentist

1005
01:19:20,055 --> 01:19:22,580
And for my moustache...

1006
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:24,221
It's unique too

1007
01:19:24,559 --> 01:19:28,051
You'll need to have the right amount

1008
01:19:28,163 --> 01:19:31,223
You know?

1009
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:47,242
Good, champion is champion

1010
01:19:47,983 --> 01:19:48,711
So?

1011
01:19:48,817 --> 01:19:51,285
Good, it's the champion

1012
01:19:51,887 --> 01:19:53,445
I've told you so

1013
01:19:53,555 --> 01:19:55,489
It's clear who's the winner, right?

1014
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:56,887
Yes...

1015
01:19:57,159 --> 01:19:59,093
So impressive

1016
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:00,223
What do you say?

1017
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:02,023
Of course...

1018
01:20:03,498 --> 01:20:05,932
Needs to be cleaned everyday

1019
01:20:06,034 --> 01:20:07,092
So spoiled

1020
01:20:07,202 --> 01:20:10,035
Or he'll be in a bad temper

1021
01:20:11,273 --> 01:20:12,501
So crazy

1022
01:20:12,774 --> 01:20:15,470
More demanding than my wife

1023
01:20:20,081 --> 01:20:22,777
So spoiled

1024
01:20:23,185 --> 01:20:24,311
Right...

1025
01:20:24,419 --> 01:20:25,886
Exactly

1026
01:20:26,521 --> 01:20:27,783
Look

1027
01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:48,708
Look, from Emperor Kangxi

1028
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:50,810
These accessories

1029
01:20:50,912 --> 01:20:54,439
I've spent a fortune on them

1030
01:20:54,749 --> 01:20:56,512
But they're worth it

1031
01:20:56,618 --> 01:20:59,553
I saw a bird cage a few days ago

1032
01:20:59,654 --> 01:21:01,849
Twenty six thousand dollars

1033
01:21:02,157 --> 01:21:02,714
Twenty six thousand!

1034
01:21:02,824 --> 01:21:04,724
One could buy a house with that

1035
01:21:04,826 --> 01:21:06,259
He said it belonged to
the Emperor Qianlong

1036
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:07,453
It's the best porcelain

1037
01:21:07,562 --> 01:21:09,325
With the seal of the famous artist

1038
01:21:12,267 --> 01:21:13,131
What are you doing?

1039
01:21:13,235 --> 01:21:13,826
What?

1040
01:21:20,442 --> 01:21:22,740
Are you mad?

1041
01:21:22,844 --> 01:21:24,903
Yes I am

1042
01:21:25,647 --> 01:21:27,706
Since we got married...

1043
01:21:27,816 --> 01:21:29,283
I haven't had one good day

1044
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:31,147
I had to take nonsense
from your dead wife before

1045
01:21:31,253 --> 01:21:33,448
And now I have to deal with you!

1046
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,022
I can't stand it

1047
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:40,860
This is the champion

1048
01:21:41,763 --> 01:21:43,526
My champ

1049
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:46,926
The champion?

1050
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:53,397
He is the champ in your eyes

1051
01:21:54,442 --> 01:21:57,002
You spend time with him everyday

1052
01:21:57,112 --> 01:22:00,377
Wash him and feed him

1053
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:02,482
Why don't you spend some time with me?

1054
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:03,778
Why don't you buy antiques for me?

1055
01:22:03,885 --> 01:22:04,909
Why don't you bathe me?

1056
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:06,783
Are you married to your wife or the bird?

1057
01:22:09,391 --> 01:22:10,756
I have a tough life

1058
01:22:15,997 --> 01:22:17,726
What a bitter life!

1059
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:21,198
I mean, see... she's jealous

1060
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:25,271
I'd say you're blessed, it's love

1061
01:22:25,373 --> 01:22:25,839
Love?

1062
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:26,873
Love

1063
01:22:30,845 --> 01:22:33,336
My dear, well...

1064
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:37,009
What now? We'll get a divorce
if you keep the birds

1065
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,085
You...

1066
01:22:40,188 --> 01:22:43,316
She is jealous.
That's what is love, you know

1067
01:22:44,693 --> 01:22:46,593
Love?

1068
01:22:46,695 --> 01:22:48,526
I've wasted my money

1069
01:22:55,337 --> 01:22:57,999
Great moustache, good for longevity

1070
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:02,100
Boss, here are the accounts
from last month

1071
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:03,274
Please take a look

1072
01:23:03,712 --> 01:23:05,179
Pass this to the lady

1073
01:23:09,451 --> 01:23:10,440
Madam, please take a look

1074
01:23:10,552 --> 01:23:11,746
Wait, say that again

1075
01:23:12,053 --> 01:23:16,046
A goose in the sky, a goose on the ground

1076
01:23:16,157 --> 01:23:19,524
I eat an goose egg, I become the goose

1077
01:23:19,627 --> 01:23:24,621
A goose in the sky, a goose on the ground

1078
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:29,898
I eat an goose egg, I become the goose

1079
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:34,168
Listen to me

1080
01:23:34,709 --> 01:23:36,643
You've got it wrong, so silly

1081
01:23:37,045 --> 01:23:39,343
What? It sounds easy

1082
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:42,077
Try it yourself

1083
01:23:42,617 --> 01:23:43,276
Listen

1084
01:23:43,385 --> 01:23:44,181
Hold on

1085
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,246
If you can't memorize it...

1086
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:47,610
What? I get beheaded?

1087
01:23:47,922 --> 01:23:49,913
No, but we'll punish you

1088
01:23:50,258 --> 01:23:51,418
Do I get rewarded if I get it right?

1089
01:23:51,526 --> 01:23:52,117
Of course...

1090
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:53,319
How?

1091
01:23:53,828 --> 01:23:57,195
I'll be generous

1092
01:23:57,298 --> 01:23:59,061
If you can get it right

1093
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:02,898
Xiaoyu will smother you with a kiss

1094
01:24:04,339 --> 01:24:05,135
Really?

1095
01:24:07,609 --> 01:24:09,509
Yes, Xiaoyu?

1096
01:24:11,212 --> 01:24:14,238
And the punishment?

1097
01:24:14,582 --> 01:24:15,879
If you get it wrong

1098
01:24:15,984 --> 01:24:18,248
A hair plucked
from your moustache each time

1099
01:24:19,087 --> 01:24:20,952
Pluck my moustache? No way

1100
01:24:21,589 --> 01:24:22,385
Then I won't kiss you

1101
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:24,185
If you refuse

1102
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:26,852
Fine, it's a deal

1103
01:24:27,262 --> 01:24:30,561
Guo Zixiang, you're our witness

1104
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:33,825
Repeat it

1105
01:24:33,935 --> 01:24:37,769
A goose in the sky, a goose on the ground

1106
01:24:37,872 --> 01:24:40,966
I eat an goose egg, I become the goose

1107
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:42,674
It's simple

1108
01:24:43,445 --> 01:24:44,207
Hold on

1109
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:47,241
You must keep your word

1110
01:24:48,216 --> 01:24:50,946
Xiaoyu, you too

1111
01:24:51,453 --> 01:24:52,385
Go on

1112
01:24:55,223 --> 01:24:59,319
One, two, three

1113
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:04,364
A goose in the sky, a goose on the ground

1114
01:25:04,466 --> 01:25:06,661
I eat the goose...

1115
01:25:07,469 --> 01:25:09,937
I eat the goose? That didn't count

1116
01:25:10,038 --> 01:25:12,063
No way

1117
01:25:12,807 --> 01:25:13,739
Drop it down

1118
01:25:13,842 --> 01:25:16,174
No

1119
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:17,437
You'll do this for real?

1120
01:25:17,545 --> 01:25:19,638
Come on, Xiaoyu

1121
01:25:20,148 --> 01:25:20,978
Sure

1122
01:25:21,883 --> 01:25:22,406
You'll really pull?

1123
01:25:22,517 --> 01:25:24,144
Don't try to get away with it

1124
01:25:32,594 --> 01:25:33,526
Come on, again

1125
01:25:34,262 --> 01:25:36,822
Listen...

1126
01:25:36,931 --> 01:25:42,267
A goose in the sky, a goose on the ground

1127
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:44,497
Goose... over

1128
01:25:45,473 --> 01:25:47,600
Another one, come on

1129
01:25:49,377 --> 01:25:50,139
This side

1130
01:25:50,245 --> 01:25:51,678
It has to be even

1131
01:25:56,818 --> 01:25:58,080
One more go

1132
01:25:58,186 --> 01:25:58,948
Listen well

1133
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:03,917
A goose in the sky, a goose on the ground

1134
01:26:04,025 --> 01:26:06,323
I eat an goose egg, I become the goose

1135
01:26:06,427 --> 01:26:09,123
I eat... a goose egg?

1136
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:11,562
I give up, not again

1137
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:13,827
No, the last one

1138
01:26:13,935 --> 01:26:15,459
Xiaoyu, come on

1139
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:17,003
Pluck from the middle

1140
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:25,809
What did you do that for?

1141
01:26:26,447 --> 01:26:28,415
Xiaoyu, be good

1142
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:29,505
Let him kiss you

1143
01:26:29,884 --> 01:26:30,612
All right

1144
01:26:38,226 --> 01:26:39,022
Come on

1145
01:26:40,662 --> 01:26:41,594
It stinks

1146
01:26:41,696 --> 01:26:42,060
Excuse me?

1147
01:26:42,163 --> 01:26:44,188
The master has bad breath

1148
01:26:44,299 --> 01:26:47,029
No way! You smell it

1149
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:49,897
So?

1150
01:26:51,072 --> 01:26:52,369
I think I'm used to it

1151
01:26:52,473 --> 01:26:53,872
I don't notice it anymore

1152
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:55,937
I've wanted to tell you since long

1153
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:57,705
My father had the same problem

1154
01:26:57,812 --> 01:26:58,608
After he went to the dentist

1155
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:01,113
...it was discovered that
he had cavities

1156
01:27:02,517 --> 01:27:03,677
My tooth...

1157
01:27:28,443 --> 01:27:29,467
It hurts?

1158
01:27:29,577 --> 01:27:31,044
Of course...

1159
01:27:32,947 --> 01:27:34,539
Better now?

1160
01:27:37,185 --> 01:27:38,652
A little

1161
01:27:41,022 --> 01:27:42,421
Let's have a look

1162
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:44,589
Pass it

1163
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:50,056
Closer

1164
01:27:50,565 --> 01:27:52,032
Better now?

1165
01:28:00,808 --> 01:28:02,605
My tooth?

1166
01:28:03,044 --> 01:28:04,477
It doesn't look like mine

1167
01:28:05,713 --> 01:28:07,010
Of course it's yours

1168
01:28:07,315 --> 01:28:10,011
It's your tooth

1169
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:11,642
Am I a dog?

1170
01:28:12,987 --> 01:28:14,477
It doesn't look like mine

1171
01:28:15,156 --> 01:28:16,214
Of course it's yours

1172
01:28:16,324 --> 01:28:18,690
They all look the same

1173
01:28:29,437 --> 01:28:32,600
It hurts

1174
01:28:34,642 --> 01:28:35,939
Any smell?

1175
01:28:39,213 --> 01:28:40,180
Yes

1176
01:28:41,582 --> 01:28:42,947
Smells like medicine

1177
01:28:46,387 --> 01:28:48,014
Gradually it'll be okay

1178
01:29:01,936 --> 01:29:02,960
No, I'm still worried

1179
01:29:03,871 --> 01:29:05,338
I'm looking forward to it

1180
01:29:09,477 --> 01:29:10,603
I'm just trying to be a good guy

1181
01:29:12,246 --> 01:29:14,146
How about another problem?

1182
01:29:14,882 --> 01:29:15,871
Another one?

1183
01:29:16,384 --> 01:29:17,715
Just trying to back her off

1184
01:29:18,453 --> 01:29:19,511
Tell her that

1185
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:20,882
In front of the master

1186
01:29:20,988 --> 01:29:21,750
In front of the master?

1187
01:29:21,856 --> 01:29:22,914
Do what?

1188
01:29:23,224 --> 01:29:24,122
Whatever she wants to do

1189
01:29:26,227 --> 01:29:28,354
In front of the master?

1190
01:29:30,131 --> 01:29:31,826
I'm impressed

1191
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:37,733
Fine, I'll do it

1192
01:29:44,412 --> 01:29:46,676
He must go with the flow though

1193
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:48,505
It's the Guanyin Festival the day after

1194
01:30:22,450 --> 01:30:26,250
Look, the pears are huge

1195
01:30:26,854 --> 01:30:27,878
Still not ripe yet

1196
01:30:27,989 --> 01:30:29,320
I want to eat

1197
01:30:29,891 --> 01:30:31,415
It's not time yet

1198
01:30:31,526 --> 01:30:32,857
I like it

1199
01:30:33,161 --> 01:30:34,287
You're really wayward

1200
01:30:35,396 --> 01:30:37,489
Guo Zixiang, help me out

1201
01:30:37,598 --> 01:30:39,793
Go get some pears

1202
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:06,117
Boss, you...

1203
01:31:06,527 --> 01:31:09,826
How could you do this here?

1204
01:31:12,333 --> 01:31:12,765
What about us?

1205
01:31:12,867 --> 01:31:13,356
What's wrong?

1206
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:14,264
What's wrong with us?

1207
01:31:14,368 --> 01:31:16,165
You...

1208
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:18,898
Today is the Guanyin Festival

1209
01:31:19,006 --> 01:31:21,839
and you're like this here...

1210
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:26,277
What? Get down here...

1211
01:31:33,588 --> 01:31:34,612
What's going on?

1212
01:31:34,722 --> 01:31:37,987
This... it's strange

1213
01:31:38,092 --> 01:31:38,717
What?

1214
01:31:38,826 --> 01:31:40,760
You're wearing clothes again?

1215
01:31:40,862 --> 01:31:42,693
Of course I'm dressed, are you crazy?

1216
01:31:43,097 --> 01:31:44,121
I'm dressed

1217
01:31:44,232 --> 01:31:45,494
You said I was naked?

1218
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,727
This tree...

1219
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:48,631
What about it?

1220
01:31:48,736 --> 01:31:50,169
You should go take a look yourself

1221
01:31:50,271 --> 01:31:52,501
I...

1222
01:31:52,607 --> 01:31:53,596
Let me help you

1223
01:32:54,368 --> 01:32:57,269
What are you doing?

1224
01:32:57,705 --> 01:33:00,105
What? We aren't doing anything

1225
01:33:17,992 --> 01:33:20,460
How could you?

1226
01:33:28,836 --> 01:33:36,242
This is a tree of sin...

1227
01:33:38,479 --> 01:33:40,037
Excellent trick

1228
01:33:42,383 --> 01:33:45,841
Then the old man went berserk

1229
01:33:45,953 --> 01:33:47,887
...and died soon after

1230
01:33:48,255 --> 01:33:49,279
What about the young man?

1231
01:33:50,257 --> 01:33:52,191
Heartless man

1232
01:33:52,827 --> 01:33:54,317
He might seem silly...

1233
01:33:54,428 --> 01:33:57,329
but actually he's up to no good

1234
01:33:57,431 --> 01:33:57,863
What did he do?

1235
01:33:57,965 --> 01:33:59,057
He and Xiaoyu

1236
01:33:59,166 --> 01:34:00,463
...they ran away together

1237
01:34:00,568 --> 01:34:02,502
Terrible!

1238
01:34:02,603 --> 01:34:03,433
Miss Jinbao

1239
01:34:05,106 --> 01:34:06,437
Mr. Wang is here

1240
01:34:06,540 --> 01:34:07,837
Who? Which one?

1241
01:34:08,342 --> 01:34:10,207
The one who took out his tooth

1242
01:34:10,311 --> 01:34:11,243
Really?

1243
01:34:16,984 --> 01:34:19,953
Jinbao...

1244
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:24,920
Jinbao...

1245
01:34:30,297 --> 01:34:32,094
Jinbao...

1246
01:34:33,067 --> 01:34:34,295
Who are you?

1247
01:34:36,637 --> 01:34:37,399
What's your name?

1248
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:39,302
Don't you recognize me?

1249
01:34:40,474 --> 01:34:42,305
Any woman could be my mother here

1250
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:46,146
Any rich man could be my customer,
poor man...

1251
01:34:49,383 --> 01:34:52,750
Jinbao...

1252
01:34:52,853 --> 01:34:54,753
I know I've left for too long

1253
01:34:54,855 --> 01:34:57,517
I came back as soon as possible

1254
01:34:57,625 --> 01:34:59,559
I've bought everything you wanted
from Shanghai

1255
01:34:59,894 --> 01:35:02,124
and the money, but I...

1256
01:35:02,229 --> 01:35:04,823
You got robbed on the way, right?

1257
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,098
How did you know?

1258
01:35:08,169 --> 01:35:10,137
Well, I have heard the story before

1259
01:35:10,237 --> 01:35:11,363
An old tale, huh?

1260
01:35:11,739 --> 01:35:13,206
It's the truth, you don't believe?

1261
01:35:14,175 --> 01:35:17,406
Yes, I believe you. It's over

1262
01:35:18,179 --> 01:35:19,703
Do me a favor

1263
01:35:19,814 --> 01:35:21,076
Find another Juliet

1264
01:35:21,449 --> 01:35:22,916
I've no time for you

1265
01:35:24,085 --> 01:35:26,246
Have you forgotten about me?

1266
01:35:27,354 --> 01:35:29,481
What about your hair?

1267
01:35:32,526 --> 01:35:34,153
C'mon, give me a break

1268
01:35:35,463 --> 01:35:36,862
What? It's fake?

1269
01:35:36,964 --> 01:35:37,862
Really?

1270
01:35:38,199 --> 01:35:39,826
If that's for real...

1271
01:35:39,934 --> 01:35:41,458
then all the girls here would be bald

1272
01:35:47,808 --> 01:35:48,934
What about my tooth?

1273
01:35:51,178 --> 01:35:53,476
You want it back?

1274
01:35:53,848 --> 01:35:54,974
Should have told me sooner

1275
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:59,584
Mr. Wang

1276
01:36:00,554 --> 01:36:01,919
Oh, cheer up

1277
01:36:06,694 --> 01:36:08,093
Pick it yourself

1278
01:36:21,175 --> 01:36:23,109
Our teeth!

1279
01:36:23,677 --> 01:36:25,941
Come out and greet the guests

1280
01:36:26,046 --> 01:36:30,346
Girls from upstairs, downstairs,
front and backyards

1281
01:36:30,451 --> 01:36:33,614
Greet the guests

1282
01:36:33,721 --> 01:36:34,380
Coming

1283
01:36:34,488 --> 01:36:35,648
Haixian

1284
01:36:39,860 --> 01:36:41,953
Yindi

1285
01:36:45,199 --> 01:36:47,793
Jinbao
