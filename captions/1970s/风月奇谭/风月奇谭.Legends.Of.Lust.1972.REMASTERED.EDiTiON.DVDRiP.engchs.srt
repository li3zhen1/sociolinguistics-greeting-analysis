别这样，人有失手马有漏蹄
Come on, it's an accident

162

万一有一天，你出了事…
If something happens to you one day...

163

算我没说，谢谢你的笔
Forget about what I said, thanks for your pen

要是别人，我真要唾他一脸吐呢

老板娘，给你来把夜壶

那你自己挑吧
Pick yourself

173

那是小孩用的
That's for kids

174

行了，将就着用吧
It's all right

175
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,949

我疯了…
I'm mad...

00:17:07,626 --> 00:17:08,991
掌柜的，回见
See you

180
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:35,513
死猫，走，快走
Damn cat

181

他妈的
Damn it

182
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:52,084
王八蛋，你往哪儿跑？
Where're you going?

王八蛋，你还走？
Asshole, stop running

184

老板又犯疑心了，你可得帮帮忙

不然一会儿拳打脚踢的

188
00:20:08,373 --> 00:20:09,032
我可受不了
I can't take it

189
00:20:09,141 --> 00:20:09,732
怎么回事？
What happened?

190
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:10,603
你不要问了
Don't ask

191
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,335
这个送给你
Take this

192
00:20:12,444 --> 00:20:13,843
你一会儿替我躺在被窝里
Go over to my bed in a while

193
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,413
老头要是有什么行动
No matter what the boss does

你可千万不要出声呀
Keep your mouth shut

王八蛋，找你娘去算帐去

开门…
Open up...

211

来了…
Coming...

212
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,176
什么事？你们三更半夜的
What's going on? It's late

213
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:28,007
什么事？他说你养汉子

214
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,013
对，还说把你打得鼻青脸肿

215
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:31,082
头发也给剪了
Cut your hair

216
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:32,706
什么头发？

别活见鬼了，你说
Tell me

这头发是哪个臭婊子的，说呀
Whose hair is this?

220
00:22:41,226 --> 00:22:41,749
真是莫名其妙
Unbelievable

221
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,690
看什么看？
What're you looking at?

222
00:22:43,261 --> 00:22:46,196
你自己在外头拈花惹草反而冤枉我
I think it's the other way round

223
00:22:46,298 --> 00:22:48,459
你说这头发到底是谁的，你说呀
Whose hair is this?

224
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:51,901
这个不是你的，那是谁的？

你还说打得我鼻青脸肿
You said that you beat me up

00:22:55,507 --> 00:22:57,441
我哪儿青了，我哪儿肿了？

229
00:22:57,542 --> 00:22:59,407
对呀，你不能冤枉好人哪

姐姐，妈都急死了
Sister, mom is worried

231
00:23:00,912 --> 00:23:03,278
你要是真有这事，她就先上吊
She'll hang herself if this was true

232
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,715
好呀，你冤枉了我不算
You accused me of cheating

233
00:23:06,818 --> 00:23:08,615
还闹到我娘家去
And you complained to my mother?

234
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:12,255
我不要活了…
How can I face people now?

235
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:14,120
姐姐…你不要这样，姐姐
Stop it, sister

别拉着我，不要拦住我

你们看，这个老不死的
Look at him

239
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:32,770
不知道跟哪个臭婊子乱扯
I don't know who he's with

240
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:35,438
脚上还系着红绳呢，算我倒霉
Red string on his toe

241
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:38,481
不是你倒霉…
You're not unlucky...

242
00:23:38,784 --> 00:23:40,547
算我他妈的不走运
I'm unlucky

243
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:44,055
你还不走运哪，脚上系着红绳不够
You've a piece of red string on your toe

244
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,555
你头上还想戴着绿帽子呀
And wish your wife to have an affair too!

245
00:23:45,657 --> 00:23:49,718
好…你说得好
Well said

你小心点
You better be careful

249
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:57,568
我是要小心点，我就是太大意了
Yes, I will get my proof next time

250
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:02,564
姓陶的胡说八道
Your husband is full of nonsense

251
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:04,767
我们姓井的也不是好欺负的
Our family is not going to be bullied around

252
00:24:07,379 --> 00:24:08,573
有什么好听？
What's there to listen, huh?

253
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:34,371
徐州的那批货后天一定要寄出

您这回去多久呀？
How long will you be away?

257
00:24:42,714 --> 00:24:44,181
少则十天，多则半个月
10 to 15 days

258
00:24:44,282 --> 00:24:46,273
家里的事情你们要帮着看着点

00:24:46,618 --> 00:24:47,243
您放心好了
Don't worry

260

死人，这个死人
How could he do that to me?

00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,169
活该，让他去死
He deserves to die

270
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:59,175
那怎么行呢？一夜夫妻百日恩
You're his wife

00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:00,869
怎么能见死不救呢？

跟那个骚娘们一块
He's now tied with that bitch

00:28:01,713 --> 00:28:03,613
叫人家绑在麻袋里有什么法子？

找刁师爷想想办法
Get Lawyer Diao to think of a plan

276
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:19,560

我动脑、动嘴、动笔

290
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:22,688

00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,052
脱衣服干什么嘛？
Why do you want me to strip?

292
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:27,097
事不宜迟，等我解释清楚了
We don't have much time now

293
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:28,631
恐怕他们两个的命都没了
Otherwise they won't be saved

294
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:35,338
那你这个忙…我可帮不上了
Then... I won't be able to help

295
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:40,411
我脱…
Fine...

296
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:42,502
这不结了吗？
It's not that hard, is it?

297
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:51,088
你把头回过去，行不行？
Turn your head away

是王成龙的老婆

00:32:14,165 --> 00:32:15,393
王成龙

327
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,564

是，是小民的老婆周氏

00:32:24,008 --> 00:32:26,067
不知道怎么得罪了陶老板
I'm not sure what we had done to offend Mr. Tao

331

带了几个长工就把我们绑起来了
Mr. Tao came in and tied us up

332
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:32,013
陶三兴，这到底是怎么回事？

333
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,716
这…这真是莫名其妙

报告大人

前几天他无缘无故的说我跟人通奸

报告大人，他是有神经病的
Sir, he's a neurotic

00:32:46,864 --> 00:32:48,456
他总是疑神疑鬼的
He has always been suspicious

341
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:51,363
岂有此理，把陶三兴拉下去
Tao Sanxing will get...

342
00:32:51,469 --> 00:32:52,629
重打四十大板

行了，都是老交情，说了就算了
It's fine

347
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:08,048
再说我们哥儿俩也不是为了钱
We're not in it for money

348
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:11,512
我知道…回去吧
I know

352
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:27,395
这怎么行呢？
This can't be?

353
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:28,233
怎么不行呢？
Why not?

354
00:33:28,339 --> 00:33:29,931
当初咱们就这么说好的嘛
We had a deal

355
00:33:30,041 --> 00:33:32,100
再说你欠了债不要你还
And you don't have to pay us

356
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:34,469
要你老婆还，还不好吗？
Your wife will. Isn't that great?

357
00:33:34,579 --> 00:33:35,546
这…
I mean...

358
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:37,079
回去吧…
Just go...

359
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:55,122
你们二位，谁先来呀？
Which one of you wants to go first?

勤政爱民
"Be a good civil servant"

373
00:34:53,891 --> 00:34:55,518
后来呢，后来怎么样？
And then what happened?

374
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,225
后来老头回到家里，又气又恨
My husband was angry when he got home

375
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:00,622
就一病不起
Then he fell sick and died

376
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:02,490
那王大锤的老婆呢？

急了抓子，饿了啃石头
He can take care of himself

393
00:35:34,599 --> 00:35:35,793
快点…把人家等急了
Come on

他们待你好不好？
Are they treating you well?

405
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:58,555
先别问我，你怎么出来的？
How did you get out?

406
00:35:59,557 --> 00:36:00,785
我偷偷跑出来的
I sneaked out

466
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:58,360
老爷，您的鹿血炖好了
Master, the virility supplement is ready

467

00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:04,432
她说马上就来
She'll be here soon

469

柯大奶奶见多识广
Mrs. Ke is a well-informed lady

470
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,616
所以我请她来教你新婚的仪点

471
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:15,950
做你洞房的规范

老爷，您请柯大奶奶教少爷行房？
Mrs. Ke is teaching the young master about sex?

474
00:39:22,059 --> 00:39:25,187
另外替天柱量一量能不能行房

要不好好的教教他
If we don't teach him properly, then he'll...

483
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,682
在人家韩小姐面前岂不贻笑大方
make a fool of himself in front of Ms Han

484

少奶奶会原谅少爷的

485
00:39:49,787 --> 00:39:52,779
老爷，您刚才说柯大奶奶量得出
Master, you said that Mrs. Ke can tell

486
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,380
少爷能不能行房？
whether the young master's ready or not

487
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:55,823
她说量得出
She said she can...

488
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:03,126
从脖子就这么一绕
Around the neck once

489
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:07,133
然后再这么一折
Put this in half

490
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,900
从鼻子头横量到耳朵边
Measure from the nose to the ear

491
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:13,101
要是过了耳朵边就能够行房了
He's ready if it passes the ear

492
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,541
不然的话…
Otherwise...

493
00:40:17,748 --> 00:40:19,545
不然的话少爷的婚期
He'll have to postpone his wedding

494
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,174
恐怕就要押后了
...to a later date

495
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:24,587
当初光绪爷就是破身子太早
Emperor Guangxu became sexually active too young

496
00:40:24,688 --> 00:40:26,679
所以老早就不行了
That's why he was impotent

497
00:40:27,324 --> 00:40:28,757
这也是书上写的？
It's recorded in the book?

498
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,591
这是千真万确的
Absolutely

499
00:40:30,694 --> 00:40:32,753
当初教光绪爷行房的
The Emperor Guangxu...

500
00:40:32,863 --> 00:40:34,728
一共有四位大奶奶
had four sex education teachers

501
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:36,800
其中的一个就是我三姑
One of them was my Third auntie

502
00:40:36,901 --> 00:40:38,391
一个就是我四姨
Another my fourth auntie

503
00:40:46,277 --> 00:40:49,735
不得了…这哪像是八岁的孩子
Unbelievable! Is he really 8 years old?

504
00:40:50,948 --> 00:40:53,439
虎父无犬子
Like father, like son

505
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,884
可不是吗？您的大名叫得好
Right, you have a good name

506
00:40:59,990 --> 00:41:03,187
高天得，得天独厚嘛
Gao Tiande, meaning the blessed one

507
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:05,893
恭喜您了，我看不出一年
Congratulations! I think...

508
00:41:05,996 --> 00:41:08,829
准给您生个白白胖胖的大孙子
you will have a grandson within one year

509
00:41:14,638 --> 00:41:16,037
这孩子真淘气
He's a naughty boy

510
00:41:18,008 --> 00:41:19,908
那要看师父的本领
Let's see how good the teacher is

511
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,170
可不能这么说呀
That's not fair

512
00:41:21,278 --> 00:41:24,145
师父领进门，修行可在个人
Teacher can teach, but the student must learn

513
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:27,909
名师出高徒这句话总不会错吧
An accomplished pupil must have a good mentor

514
00:41:28,552 --> 00:41:31,112
咱们两个丑话可说在头里
We don't have to go into this

515
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:34,658
食色性也，孔夫子也不能反对
Man's lust for food and sex is natural

516
00:41:36,393 --> 00:41:38,657
不过什么事都不能过量
Nothing can be excessive... especially sex

517
00:41:38,762 --> 00:41:42,698
尤其是房事，所以养生节育
that involves staying healthy and birth control

518
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,701
有一定的界期和无定的界期
There are certain dates

519
00:41:45,803 --> 00:41:48,704
另外加上天忌地忌人忌
I mean... during the year

520
00:41:48,806 --> 00:41:51,468
一年有一百零一天不能行房
There're 101 days you can't have intercourse

521
00:41:51,575 --> 00:41:54,169
另外立春立秋，夏至冬至
Then during First day of Spring

522
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:57,338
甲子庚生日，夏至后的鼎金日
First day of Autumn

523
00:41:57,448 --> 00:42:00,246
冬至后的庚辛日、舍日、腊日
Summer solstice, winter solstice

524
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,911
天空日、夫妇元辰本应日
And on a few particular festivals

525
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,011
大月的十七跟小月的十六
During the middle of a month; all these days

526
00:42:05,122 --> 00:42:07,090
都是戒日，不能行房
you must refrain from having intercourse

527
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:09,983
你要记住了，免得老来受苦
Remember... or you'll suffer when you're old

528
00:42:10,094 --> 00:42:12,619
腰酸腿疼，又咳嗽又喘
You'll be in pain, coughing all the time

529
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,362
你看是不是？
Do you agree?

530
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:20,332
好了
All right

531
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:29,940
开始上课吧
Let's begin

532
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:32,647
开始吧
Let's start

533
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:34,775
柯大奶奶，开始吧
Please start, Mrs. Ke

534
00:42:43,761 --> 00:42:44,693
怎么？
Sorry?

535
00:42:45,095 --> 00:42:46,357
开始吧
Please start

536
00:42:47,665 --> 00:42:48,996
你们要旁听
You want to listen too?

537
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,028
对不起，我是法不传六耳
Sorry, this lesson is meant as one-to-one

538
00:42:52,136 --> 00:42:54,764
有人在，不便说
No third party

539
00:42:55,506 --> 00:42:57,064
我明白…
I understand

540
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,241
高明、张妈，你们都出去
Gao Ming, Gao Ma, leave us

541
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:09,178
您也不行
You too

542
00:43:10,788 --> 00:43:11,720
对不起
Sorry

543
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:13,084
哪里…
No problem

544
00:43:31,775 --> 00:43:34,243
你干什么？干什么…起来
What are you doing? Get up

545
00:43:35,112 --> 00:43:36,136
你想要干什么？
What were you thinking?

546
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:39,509
你不是要行房吗？
Sex, of course

547
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:40,641
什么？
Pardon?

548
00:43:43,020 --> 00:43:44,817
呸，谁要行房？
Hey, are you mad?

549
00:43:45,389 --> 00:43:48,017
我要行房？我要跟你行房？
With you?

550
00:43:48,993 --> 00:43:52,554
好色小子，想得倒美呀，小兔崽子
Silly brat

551
00:43:53,697 --> 00:43:56,928
起来，把衣服穿上
Get up, get dressed

552
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:00,366
那怎么教呀？
What then?

553
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:06,369
先教术科，术科里头要先教术语
Theories and the terms first

554
00:44:06,810 --> 00:44:08,539
离这个真刀真枪的实习
You aren't ready...

555
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:09,874
还差十万八千里呢
for the real thing yet

556
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:13,772
你看着呀
Look at this

557
00:44:17,187 --> 00:44:18,176
看见了没有？
Done?

558
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:23,150
这个就代表你的那个“那话儿”
This represents your willy

559
00:44:26,897 --> 00:44:29,593
我的“那话儿”？我的“那话儿”？
My willy? What willy?

560
00:44:29,900 --> 00:44:31,299
就是你的那个
Your peepee

561
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:33,736
我的那个…
My...

562
00:44:38,842 --> 00:44:41,709
我的那个叫“那话儿”
My peepee is called a "willy"

563
00:44:42,079 --> 00:44:43,944
那你的那个叫什么话儿？
Then what does your peepee go by?

564
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:44,844
不像话
Ridiculous

565
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:47,014
不像话
Ridiculous

566
00:44:47,317 --> 00:44:48,875
什么不像话
No

567
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:53,283
你听着，人家韩小姐可是个翰墨人
Listen, Miss Han is so learned

568
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,592
不会粗口粗舌的，所以你要记着
Remember to be civilized

569
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:58,889
你的那话儿不能叫那话儿
You can't say peepee or willy

570
00:44:58,996 --> 00:44:59,894
那叫什么？
What then?

571
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:03,896
名称可多了，所以你要记着
There're many ways to call it

572
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:06,696
可不能在媳妇面前透着没学问
Just observe the proper etiquette

573
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:09,838
也不能叫阳具，太粗俗了
Not the prick, too vulgar

574
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:11,134
要叫人道
The penis

575
00:45:11,942 --> 00:45:14,433
再文艺一点叫马藏
Or the member

576
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:15,938
麻将呀
Member of what?

577
00:45:16,046 --> 00:45:17,638
什么麻将，还牌九呢
Not that kind of member

578
00:45:18,048 --> 00:45:19,447
叫马藏

579

590
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:37,060
记住了吗？

00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:38,134
记住了
Yep

592
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:40,669
好，那么咱们再重复一次
Let's repeat

597
00:46:04,094 --> 00:46:05,561
大玉，柯大奶奶在讲课
Dayu, Mrs. Ke is teaching

598
00:46:05,662 --> 00:46:07,152
不要吵，快回去
Keep quiet, leave

599
00:46:08,966 --> 00:46:10,763
男有五常，女有五欲
The male has 5 principles; & the female- 5 desires

600
00:46:10,868 --> 00:46:12,062
男有七损八益
You must practise sex correctly

601
00:46:12,169 --> 00:46:13,932
女有九气十斗
Only then can both partners benefit

602
00:46:14,037 --> 00:46:16,369
交结之道虽然日新月异
Although there are many styles

603
00:46:16,473 --> 00:46:18,771
归纳起来只有九法

以你现在的年龄，要以不变应万变

00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:46,564
天为阳，地为阴
Heaven is Yang, earth is Yin

610
00:46:46,670 --> 00:46:48,763
日为阳，月为阴
Sun is Yang, moon is yin

611
00:46:48,872 --> 00:46:52,103
所以在你新婚的日月里
After you're married pay your respects...

612
00:46:52,209 --> 00:46:56,771
拜完天地至于行天地日月之法

日在上，月在下
The sun is above, moon below

615
00:47:01,218 --> 00:47:03,948
也就是说你在上，韩小姐在下
You're on top, Miss Han under

616
00:47:04,054 --> 00:47:08,081
否则就要五劳七伤
Otherwise you'll be hurting yourself

617
00:47:08,192 --> 00:47:09,921
五劳七伤？真的？
Really?

618
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:10,857
真的
Yes

619
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:12,458
糟了
Oh no!

620
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:13,552

00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,137
怎么生呀？
How?

648
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:32,719
高老爷，恭喜恭喜
Congratulations

649
00:50:34,264 --> 00:50:36,061
明年抱孙子
You'll have a grandson next year

650
00:50:37,534 --> 00:50:38,091
咱们走吧
Let's go

651
00:50:38,201 --> 00:50:38,599
好呀
Yes

652
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:39,293
来…
Come on

653
00:50:39,403 --> 00:50:40,836
我也去
I'm going too

654
00:51:12,436 --> 00:51:13,801
咱们到那边去吧
Let's go over there

655
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:34,156
别吵
Quiet

656
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:48,004
天在上，地在下
Heaven on top, earth below

657
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,936
日在上，月在下
Sun on top, moon below

658
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,504
我在上，你在下
I'm on top, you're below

659
00:52:05,889 --> 00:52:06,856
不要吵
Keep quiet

660
00:52:07,691 --> 00:52:11,525
叫一叫，要你的命，下床
One sound and I'll kill you. Get down

661
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:24,967
不要嘛
Don't!

662
00:52:26,009 --> 00:52:32,107
不要…我不要
No...

663
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:37,485
不要嘛
Please

664
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:40,481
不要…
No...

665
00:52:40,590 --> 00:52:43,320
我告诉你，我叫范二虎
My name is Fan Erhu

666
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:44,518
是她的表哥
I'm her cousin

667
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:47,027
我们俩从小就订了亲
We were engaged since we were little

668
00:52:47,797 --> 00:52:50,129
是她爹嫌贫爱富
Her father opted for wealth

669
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:55,603
嫁给你，嫁给你这个毛孩子
You were just a kid

670
00:52:56,573 --> 00:53:00,134
我告诉你，今儿个是我跟她洞房
Tonight is our wedding night

671
00:53:00,977 --> 00:53:02,604
乖乖的看着
You sit still

672
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:05,541
你要是不乖
If you make a sound

673
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:08,708
我就白刀子进红刀子出
Blood will be on my dagger

674
00:53:08,985 --> 00:53:10,111
听见没有？
You understand?

675
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:21,197
虎哥
Hu

676
00:53:23,934 --> 00:53:26,300
虎哥？怎么会叫虎哥呢？
Hu? Who's that?

677
00:53:28,038 --> 00:53:29,665
龙精虎猛呀
As strong as a tiger

678
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:40,912
天在上，地在下
Heaven on top, earth below

679
00:53:41,017 --> 00:53:43,212
日在上，月在下
Sun on top, moon below

680
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:52,594
我不在上，你在上，笑话
I'm not on top, you're on top; how absurd!

681
00:53:59,636 --> 00:54:01,934
没想到这小子人小鬼大
I'm impressed

682
00:54:11,248 --> 00:54:13,079
包你明年抱个大孙子
You'll have a grandson next year

683
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:14,650
行，你真行
You're a good teacher

684
00:54:14,751 --> 00:54:15,911
我行有什么用？
Of what good is that?

685
00:54:16,019 --> 00:54:18,146
没有虎父也有虎子
Your son outshines you

686
00:54:29,866 --> 00:54:31,265
五劳七伤
Harmful to your health!

687
00:54:39,976 --> 00:54:42,069
少爷、少奶奶，吃早点了
It's breakfast time, young master and lady

688
00:54:42,178 --> 00:54:44,043
少爷，吃早点了
It's time for breakfast

689
00:54:44,681 --> 00:54:45,875
少爷
Young master

690
00:54:45,982 --> 00:54:46,880
谁？
Who is it?

691
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:48,479
吃早点了
It's time for breakfast

692
00:54:50,387 --> 00:54:51,820
叫她们放在外面
Ask them to leave the food outside

693
00:54:55,959 --> 00:54:58,325
他们说叫你们放在外面
They said to leave the food outside

694
00:54:58,428 --> 00:54:59,053
他们？
They?

695
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:00,356
好像有个男人的声音
I heard a man's voice

696
00:55:00,463 --> 00:55:01,521
怎么会呢？
Why's that?

697
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:06,593
少爷，都快晌午了
Master, it's almost noon

698
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:07,670
你该起来了
You should get up

699
00:55:08,638 --> 00:55:09,570
再叫
Again

700
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:14,306
少爷、少奶奶…
Young master, young lady

701
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:15,672
来了
Coming...

702
00:55:19,516 --> 00:55:20,574
少奶奶早
Morning, young lady

703
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,849
少爷还睡着，让我来
The master's still asleep, let me

704
00:55:32,829 --> 00:55:33,124
少爷
Young master

705
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:33,991
大玉
Dayu

706
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:35,161
少爷
Young master

707
00:55:35,265 --> 00:55:36,197
出去
Get out

708
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:41,396
要是不出去，我就宰了他，滚
I'll beat him if you don't leave. Now scram

709
00:55:42,138 --> 00:55:43,833
你们两个还不滚
Just get out

710
00:55:44,874 --> 00:55:45,863
滚
Out

711
00:55:45,975 --> 00:55:47,169
是…
Yes

712
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:48,609
你说什么？
What did you say?

713
00:55:48,712 --> 00:55:50,236
少爷给他们绑起来了
They tied up the young master?

714
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,212
老爷，这可怎么办呢？
What should we do now?

715
00:55:52,315 --> 00:55:53,714
老爷，投鼠忌器
Master, we must be careful

716
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:55,876
少爷在房里不能不小心
They have the young master as their hostage

717
00:55:58,988 --> 00:55:59,977
报官…
Call the police...

718
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:04,518
来
Come on

719
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:09,990
站住，叫军队撤出去
Get them out now

720
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:12,657
不然我就杀了他
Or I'll kill him

721
00:56:16,239 --> 00:56:19,470
爹…
Dad...

722
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:24,471
各位，请前面商量商量，请…
Everyone, let's talk over there...

723
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:34,387
二虎哥
Cousin Erhu

724
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:36,015
不要怕
Don't worry

725
00:56:38,328 --> 00:56:40,296
他们叫咱们过不好
They treat us terribly

726
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:42,054
咱们也叫他们不好过
We'll do the same

727
00:56:43,199 --> 00:56:44,962
现在他们越不痛快
Now that they're worried

728
00:56:45,535 --> 00:56:48,504
咱们就越痛快，来
We should just enjoy ourselves, come on

729
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:57,947
告诉他们再要执迷不悟
Tell them to give up

730
00:56:58,047 --> 00:57:00,140
把韩佩琴的父母各打四十大板
Or Han Peiqin's parents will get the cane too

731
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,012
是
Yes

732
00:57:04,421 --> 00:57:06,685
好嘛，打呀
Go on then

733
00:57:07,056 --> 00:57:09,115
打的是他们关我什么事？
They're the ones getting the cane

734
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:11,384
如果真是痛痒相关的话
If they really love me

735
00:57:11,494 --> 00:57:13,758
他们也不会把我嫁到高家来
They wouldn't have married me here

736
00:57:15,398 --> 00:57:16,660
四十大板？
40 strokes of cane?!

737
00:57:17,233 --> 00:57:19,326
八十大板都解不了恨
Even 80 won't suffice

738
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,107
县长，这…
Sir, then...

739
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:31,908
老爷，您看这…
Look

740
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:33,141
不要多嘴
Shut up

741
00:59:06,075 --> 00:59:07,667
小王八蛋，吵什么你
Shut up, little ass

742
01:00:12,275 --> 01:00:16,439
王八蛋，一对狗男女，畜牲
A pair of animals

743
01:00:19,849 --> 01:00:22,113
畜牲，王八蛋？
Animals?

744
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:29,992
后来呢？把你们怎么样了？
Then what happened?

745
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,894
打了二虎哥一百板子
Cousin Erhu got caned 100 strokes

746
01:00:33,162 --> 01:00:36,256
判了个无期徒刑，把我卖给风月楼
Sentenced to life in prison

747
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:39,064
你知道第一个到风月楼来找我的
Do you know who's my first customer here?

748
01:00:39,168 --> 01:00:40,100
是谁吗？
Who?

749
01:00:40,203 --> 01:00:40,828
是谁？
Tell us

750
01:00:40,937 --> 01:00:42,495
就是那判案子的县官
The judge for my case

751
01:00:43,206 --> 01:00:45,106
这种人满嘴的仁义道德
Morals and virtues; bloody hypocrites!

752
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:46,402
满肚子男盗女娼
They are the ones who are the worst

753
01:00:47,043 --> 01:00:49,204
对了，听说你从良了
I heard you've left our line of work

754
01:00:49,312 --> 01:00:50,301
怎么又回来了？
What are you doing back here again?

755
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:53,679
又回来了？
Back here again?

756
01:00:54,217 --> 01:00:57,152
我在这儿出出进进少说也三次了
I've been in and out of this place thrice

757
01:00:57,353 --> 01:00:58,115
三次？
Three times?

758
01:00:58,521 --> 01:01:01,752
第一次嫁给一个开当铺的倒蛮不错
I was married to a pawn shop owner once

759
01:01:01,858 --> 01:01:03,826
后来为了一棵树，分开了
We separated because of a tree

760
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:04,984
一棵树？
A tree?

761
01:01:05,094 --> 01:01:05,856
一棵树
A tree

762
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:09,191
一棵淫树
A tree of sin

763
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:13,230
其实是一棵梨树
It was actually a pear tree

764
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:15,433
和普通梨树一样的梨树
Just like any other tree

765
01:01:16,105 --> 01:01:20,906
夏绿秋黄，冬天落叶，春天发芽
It grows normally

766
01:01:21,210 --> 01:01:22,802
可是邓洪发知道
Deng Hongfa knew that

767
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:24,743
它的确跟旁的梨树不同
...the tree was unique

768
01:01:25,248 --> 01:01:27,876
邓洪发是开当铺的
Mr. Deng opened a pawn shop

769
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:31,511
有名的守财奴，家里挺有钱的
He's a well known miser, quite well off

770
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:34,556
喜欢养鹰、喂鸟、打太极
His hobbies include Taichi, keeping birds as pets

771
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,695
这家伙为了找鸟食
In order to feed his birds...

772
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:52,798
常跑到园子里去找蚱蜢
He often looked for grasshoppers in the garden

773
01:02:22,271 --> 01:02:24,262
这棵树被叫做淫树的由来
The story regarding the tree of sin

774
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:27,206
是邓洪发在无意中爬到树上发现
happened one day when Deng Hongfa

775
01:02:27,610 --> 01:02:29,840
据说从树上往下看
...looked down from the tree

776
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:32,107
人人都变成了亚当夏娃了
Everyone under the tree appeared naked

777
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,982
可是在树下景物依然
But it's all normal when not seen from the tree

778
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,784
所以他特别挂了一张木牌子
He put up a notice on the tree

779
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:39,548
禁止任何人上树
No climbing

780
01:02:40,757 --> 01:02:44,090
其实这全是我变的戏法
Actually it's my trick

781
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:52,829
你饿了？
Are you hungry?

782
01:02:54,670 --> 01:02:56,035
饿了？
Hungry?

783
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:08,713
舒服吗？
Comfortable?

784
01:03:08,818 --> 01:03:10,080
舒服
Yes

785
01:03:14,857 --> 01:03:17,087
邓家的大太太去世以后
After his first wife passed away

786
01:03:17,193 --> 01:03:18,353
我被扶了正
...I took her place

787
01:03:27,603 --> 01:03:30,868
你知道了，那个老家伙人老心不老
The old man is quite young at heart

788
01:03:31,507 --> 01:03:33,304
可是有心无力
But he's lousy in bed

789
01:03:34,544 --> 01:03:37,672
于是小玉经常给我穿针引线
My maid Xiaoyu acted as my go-between

790
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:40,715
反正铺子里的小伙子多的是
There're plenty of young guys in the shop

791
01:03:42,885 --> 01:03:43,817
小蔡
Xiaocai

792
01:03:56,732 --> 01:03:57,664
太太
Madam

793
01:04:00,369 --> 01:04:01,529
什么事？
What?

794
01:04:02,872 --> 01:04:05,363
小蔡说今天有个海员当了个老婆
Xiaocai said a sailor pawned his wife

795
01:04:05,474 --> 01:04:06,441
当老婆？
Pawned his wife?

796
01:04:06,976 --> 01:04:08,000
老婆怎么个当法？
How?

797
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:09,304
是个不用吃不用喝
One who doesn't need to be fed

798
01:04:09,412 --> 01:04:11,039
也不会争风吃醋的老婆
...and who never gets jealous

799
01:04:11,147 --> 01:04:12,978
乱讲，越说我越不懂了
That's ridiculous

800
01:04:13,082 --> 01:04:14,982
他说西典侠客游记里写过的
It's been written in books

801
01:04:15,084 --> 01:04:16,574
是给航海的人预备的
They are made for the sailors

802
01:04:16,686 --> 01:04:18,881
用橡皮做的，叫做客妻
Made from rubber, called puppet wife

803
01:04:18,988 --> 01:04:21,821
用的时候一吹气就跟真人一样
When you blow it up, it becomes a life size doll

804
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:23,818
那我倒要开开眼
I want to take a look

805
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:32,262
小蔡
Xiaocai

806
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:35,633
干嘛？
Yes?

807
01:04:35,905 --> 01:04:38,066
听说有个海员当了一个橡皮人
I heard a sailor pawned a rubber doll

808
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:39,835
是呀，这个世界上什么事情都有
Yes, anything is possible

809
01:04:39,942 --> 01:04:41,034
让我看看
I want to take a look

810
01:04:41,644 --> 01:04:43,669
怎么？最好交给我保管
What? I better safe keep it

811
01:04:43,779 --> 01:04:45,542
要不然你们这些年轻小伙子
Otherwise you young lads

812
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:48,014
偷拿去用用，给人用坏了
...will steal it and ruin it

813
01:04:48,951 --> 01:04:50,043
都打了包了
It's all wrapped up

814
01:04:50,152 --> 01:04:51,949
老板那么凶，谁敢去动？
The boss is mean, no one would dare

815
01:04:52,321 --> 01:04:54,619
别人当然不敢了，你还不敢？
Yes, maybe for the others

816
01:04:54,991 --> 01:04:57,858
不要说是橡皮人，真人你也偷着用
I mean, you ain'tjust stealing the rubber doll!

817
01:04:58,227 --> 01:04:59,285
快给我看看
Quick, let me see

818
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:00,987
好，跟我来
Okay, come with me

819
01:05:18,881 --> 01:05:20,041
快点
Hurry

820
01:05:40,369 --> 01:05:41,461
我去拿
I'll get it

821
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:00,384
怎么这么难看？神头鬼脸的
It's horrible!

822
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:01,622
比你怎么行？
How could it be compared to you?

823
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:03,817
航海人一走就是十天半个月的
Sailors spend most of their time onboard

824
01:06:03,926 --> 01:06:06,087
总比没有好，你没听说过
Well, something is better than nothing

825
01:06:06,195 --> 01:06:09,062
当兵三年，老母猪都赛貂蝉
Anyone will do when one is desperate

826
01:06:41,230 --> 01:06:42,356
差不多了
Almost

827
01:06:47,236 --> 01:06:48,260
好了吧
Done

828
01:06:54,844 --> 01:06:55,742
你敢
Stop it

829
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:29,508
最近管楼的小蔡神魂颠倒
Xiaocai has been acting strange lately

830
01:07:29,612 --> 01:07:30,579
魂不守舍
He can't focus on his work

831
01:07:31,547 --> 01:07:33,913
你知道为什么吗？
Do you know why?

832
01:07:34,417 --> 01:07:35,816
魂不守舍？
Not focused?

833
01:07:37,553 --> 01:07:39,180
我…我不觉得
I haven't noticed

834
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:40,983
你当然看不出来了
Of course you haven't

835
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:43,048
这几天一见了我
These few days whenever he sees me...

836
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:44,717
就贼眉鼠眼，鬼鬼祟祟的
He's been acting very sneaky

837
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,289
一定没安着好心眼
I think he's up to no good

838
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:49,793
不会吧，小蔡在柜上六七年了
Xiaocai has been working for over 6 years now

839
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:54,794
害人之心不可有，防人之心不可无
One must protect his own interests first

840
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:57,666
由明天起，你替他管楼
You take over his job starting tomorrow

841
01:07:58,974 --> 01:08:00,373
我…
Me...

842
01:08:00,476 --> 01:08:03,274
先把他调到柜上去，叫他做管理
Send him to manage the front desk

843
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:04,573
看他几个月再说
Then we'll see after a few months

844
01:08:05,114 --> 01:08:07,309
明天我让他把钥匙交给你
I'll get him to pass you the keys tomorrow

845
01:08:07,416 --> 01:08:08,849
除了我一把之外
I've got my own set of keys

846
01:08:08,951 --> 01:08:10,475
一切可由你负责了
You must be responsible

847
01:08:10,586 --> 01:08:11,245
我…
I...

848
01:08:11,353 --> 01:08:13,287
你可千万要记住了
Remember

849
01:08:13,689 --> 01:08:16,886
对我，对柜上一定要忠心
You must be loyal to me and the company

850
01:08:17,693 --> 01:08:19,524
我会时常试探你的
I'll test you from time to time

851
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:22,924
忠心，吃用不尽
If you're loyal, you'll be rewarded

852
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:24,431
不忠心…
If not...

853
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:30,404
员外这么相信我
You trust me

854
01:08:30,506 --> 01:08:31,803
我怎么会不忠心呢？
Of course I'll be loyal

855
01:08:31,907 --> 01:08:33,738
好，忠心就好
That's good to know

856
01:08:35,644 --> 01:08:36,838
你随我来
Follow me

857
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:01,596
你先练一练
Practise first

858
01:09:01,704 --> 01:09:04,434
什么事情都是一朝生两朝熟
You'll get used to it

859
01:09:05,007 --> 01:09:06,372
然后熟能生巧
...once you gain more experience

860
01:09:06,909 --> 01:09:09,400
只要细心、小心、当心
Pay attention to details, work seriously

861
01:09:09,512 --> 01:09:10,706
最主要是忠心
Most important is being loyal

862
01:09:10,813 --> 01:09:12,144
是…
Yes...

863
01:09:29,431 --> 01:09:30,830
好呀你
You

864
01:09:30,933 --> 01:09:33,060
怪不得这几天你魂不守舍
No wonder you've been acting strange lately

865
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:35,262
原来你躲在这儿在偷人哪
You're sleeping with someone here?

866
01:09:36,305 --> 01:09:39,001
是个客人当的，我试试
A customer pawned this, I'm just trying it out

867
01:09:39,308 --> 01:09:40,935
你试试？你这样搞七搞八的
Trying it out?

868
01:09:41,043 --> 01:09:42,510
搞坏了怎么办？你赔得起吗？
You'll ruin it, can you pay for the damages?

869
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:44,238
是…我好奇
I was... just curious

870
01:09:44,580 --> 01:09:47,140
好奇？你买了鞍子了吗？好奇？
Curious! What kind of excuse is that?

871
01:09:47,583 --> 01:09:48,880
真人你怎么不去骑呢？
Why don't you just find a woman?

872
01:10:18,380 --> 01:10:20,746
赶快洗洗，洗干净点
Clean it up right away

873
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:22,982
晚上送到我房里去
Send it to my room tonight

874
01:10:24,853 --> 01:10:26,718
对了，从明天起
Right, starting tomorrow

875
01:10:26,822 --> 01:10:28,289
你把钥匙交给郭子祥
Pass the keys to Guo Zixiang

876
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:30,148
你调到柜上去做管理
You work on the front desk

877
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:32,227
这儿就由他做管楼，知道吗？
He'll take over, got it?

878
01:10:32,695 --> 01:10:33,491
知道
Yes, boss

879
01:10:34,830 --> 01:10:35,990
走吧
Go

880
01:10:43,505 --> 01:10:44,472
小玉
Xiaoyu

881
01:10:55,751 --> 01:10:56,911
刚才你到哪儿去了？
Where were you?

882
01:10:57,019 --> 01:10:58,213
找了半天都找不着
I've been looking for you everywhere

883
01:10:58,621 --> 01:10:59,713
我不是在这儿吗？
I was right here

884
01:11:01,156 --> 01:11:02,248
给我炖人参汤去
Cook some ginseng soup for me

885
01:11:02,358 --> 01:11:03,256
我没空
I'm busy

886
01:11:03,359 --> 01:11:03,984
干什么？
What?

887
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:05,321
太太叫我去买东西
The madam has asked me to run some errands

888
01:11:05,427 --> 01:11:06,052
买什么？
What kind of errands?

889
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:07,185
买瓜子
Buying dried melon seeds

890
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:20,834
臭嘴，死丫头，总有一天把你摆平
What kind of attitude was that?

891
01:11:21,810 --> 01:11:23,710
来…你们来
Come along...

892
01:11:24,446 --> 01:11:26,676
打打卫生麻将，卫生…
Let's play mahjong

893
01:11:26,782 --> 01:11:28,511
这次太阳可打西边出来了
We are very lucky

894
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:31,017
咱们员外今天多和气呀
You're in a good mood today

895
01:11:31,353 --> 01:11:33,116
做买卖不和气怎么行呢？
For business one has got to be in good spirits

896
01:11:33,222 --> 01:11:34,780
和气生财嘛
You'll make more when you're in a good mood

897
01:11:34,890 --> 01:11:37,324
二十四圈太多，八圈太少
24 rounds are too much, 8 are too little

898
01:11:37,426 --> 01:11:38,757
干脆十二圈
12 rounds is fine

899
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:42,192
你们先打着，我去看看帐去
Go ahead, I'll go check on the books

900
01:11:43,332 --> 01:11:44,856
太太，多赢点
I hope you'll win more, dear

901
01:11:55,611 --> 01:11:59,138
你今天应该请客，升了管楼了
You should treat us today, you are promoted

902
01:11:59,248 --> 01:12:00,215
对呀…
Right...

903
01:12:00,316 --> 01:12:02,443
其实今天应该是太太请客
The madam should treat us today

904
01:12:02,551 --> 01:12:04,041
你们看，员外对太太多体帖
The boss loves her so much

905
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:05,916
当然了，他不对太太体帖
Goes without saying! When he loves her...

906
01:12:06,021 --> 01:12:07,886
太太就会对他体帖了嘛
she will be nicer to him too

907
01:12:09,158 --> 01:12:10,420
我们员外这个人哪
As for my husband, the most...

908
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:12,687
爱胡子第一，爱鸟第二
he loves his moustache, his pet birds the second

909
01:12:12,795 --> 01:12:14,092
爱他的几颗牙第三
His teeth the third

910
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:17,661
体帖我呀，黄鼠狼给鸡拜年
He doesn't take me seriously though

911
01:12:17,766 --> 01:12:19,165
没安着好心眼
...unless he needs a favor

912
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:30,745
碰，胡了，小胡
I win

913
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,038
小胡有什么好胡的
Didn't expect you to win!

914
01:12:33,415 --> 01:12:34,712
小的不去大的不来
Just going with the flow

915
01:12:34,817 --> 01:12:36,751
你倒好，神枪手，专门放冲
Good going! You're cool

916
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:38,982
小白脸呢？小白脸
Where is the White Dragon?

917
01:12:40,723 --> 01:12:42,156
小白脸就是没好心眼
You're trying to be elusive but anyhow...

918
01:12:42,891 --> 01:12:44,586
可把我想死了
I still adore you

919
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:53,891
对我要忠心，我会时常试探你的
Be loyal, I'll test you from time to time

920
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:07,176
小玉，你替我打两把
Xiaoyu, you take my place

921
01:14:29,097 --> 01:14:31,793
死丫头，今天可把你摆平了吧
I'll get even today

922
01:14:41,210 --> 01:14:44,907
小玉，小鼻头小眼，小不点儿
Xiaoyu, your small nose and small eyes

923
01:14:46,315 --> 01:14:53,346
雪白的小脸蛋，没有一个麻子
What a lovely face

924
01:14:59,294 --> 01:15:01,990
真听话，叫你躺着你躺着
You're a good girl, lying down so still

925
01:15:02,097 --> 01:15:03,291
叫你趴着你趴着
So submissive

926
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:05,993
等会要你的命
I'm going to show you what I've got

927
01:15:11,807 --> 01:15:19,111
雪白的小脸蛋，没有一个麻子
Such a pretty face

928
01:15:20,516 --> 01:15:24,316
小玉，我是大玉，看清楚了没有？
Take a closer look, I'm your wife

929
01:15:38,500 --> 01:15:39,762
怎么样？好不好？
Well? Yes or no?

930
01:15:39,868 --> 01:15:41,495
不错，一定不少钱吧
Must have cost you a fortune

931
01:15:41,603 --> 01:15:44,197
当然了，你要是喜欢的话
Yes, if you like it...

932
01:15:44,406 --> 01:15:45,236
我就送给你
you may have it

933
01:15:45,474 --> 01:15:47,066
别逗了，你哪会那么大方
Are you teasing me? This is from you?

934
01:15:47,442 --> 01:15:48,568
我当然没那么大方了
Of course not

935
01:15:48,677 --> 01:15:50,577
是太太叫我送给你的
The madam gave this to you

936
01:15:50,679 --> 01:15:51,737
太太？
The madam?

937
01:15:51,847 --> 01:15:54,475
说是庆贺你荣升管楼的礼物
A gift for your promotion

938
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:56,081
真的？
Really?

939
01:15:56,351 --> 01:15:57,340
我骗你干什么
Why would I lie to you?

940
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:02,752
不过无功受禄寝食不安，对不对？
You'd feel uneasy when you've received a gift

941
01:16:03,525 --> 01:16:04,457
再说嘛
...which you know you don't deserve

942
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,256
得人钱财与人消灾，是不是？
So you should do your part, agree?

943
01:16:07,362 --> 01:16:09,227
消灾？消什么灾？
My part? What part?

944
01:16:09,331 --> 01:16:11,595
你知道，老爷要出门瞻养去了
The boss is going away

945
01:16:11,700 --> 01:16:12,997
过几天才能回来
...for a short trip

946
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:15,194
她一个人在家怪闷得很
Madam will be bored alone

947
01:16:15,304 --> 01:16:17,534
今儿个晚上叫你陪陪她
Why don't you accompany her tonight?

948
01:16:17,639 --> 01:16:20,540
干什么？打麻将呀？
To do what? Play mahjong?

949
01:16:20,876 --> 01:16:23,344
笨蛋，你跟她两个人
You and her together

950
01:16:23,845 --> 01:16:26,336
两个人干嘛？下棋呀？
Do what? Play chess?

951
01:16:26,915 --> 01:16:28,177
下棋我可不会
I don't know how

952
01:16:29,251 --> 01:16:30,843
两个人能干的事多着呢
There're plenty of things you could do

953
01:16:30,953 --> 01:16:32,113
非得下棋呀
Notjust playing chess

954
01:16:32,220 --> 01:16:33,346
何况关上了房门
When the door is closed...

955
01:16:33,455 --> 01:16:34,717
爱干什么就干什么
You can do whatever you want

956
01:16:34,823 --> 01:16:37,758
上棋下棋，谁管得了你们
No one would care

957
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:46,691
我明白了
I've got it

958
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:51,800
你明白了，还算你聪明
At least you're not stupid

959
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:54,333
一定是老爷叫你来试探我的
The boss sent you to test me, right?

960
01:16:56,645 --> 01:16:57,703
试探你？
Test you?

961
01:16:58,981 --> 01:17:00,141
试探你什么？
For what?

962
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:02,039
试探我对他忠不忠心
My loyalty

963
01:17:05,854 --> 01:17:07,515
你还以为我不知道
You thought I don't know?

964
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:10,018
你这个人真是讨厌
You're unbelievable

965
01:17:10,125 --> 01:17:11,183
看你想到哪去了
What are you talking about?

966
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:13,227
太太是什么样的人你又不是不知道
You should know madam's nature

967
01:17:13,328 --> 01:17:16,263
再说，我是为老爷出卖别人的人？
Am I the type of person to do such a thing?

968
01:17:16,365 --> 01:17:17,332
你真小看了我
That's so wrong of you

969
01:17:17,432 --> 01:17:20,924
好…我相信你，我也不叫你为难
I believe you, I don't want you to get into trouble

970
01:17:21,670 --> 01:17:23,331
要是太太对我真有心的话
If the madam is serious about it

971
01:17:23,438 --> 01:17:24,700
我出个题目难难她
I've a problem for her to solve

972
01:17:24,806 --> 01:17:26,171
什么题目？
What problem?

973
01:17:26,274 --> 01:17:27,935
证明不是老爷试探我
She must prove that the boss isn't testing me

974
01:17:28,043 --> 01:17:30,807
第一，先把老爷喜欢的鸟摔死一只
First, kill one of the boss' birds

975
01:17:30,912 --> 01:17:31,401
干什么？
Why?

976
01:17:31,513 --> 01:17:32,775
别打岔，还有呀
Then

977
01:17:32,881 --> 01:17:34,746
把他的胡子拔下三根
Pluck out three hairs of his moustache

978
01:17:35,017 --> 01:17:35,779
他一共才几根？
He hasn't got many

979
01:17:35,884 --> 01:17:38,853
还有，再把他的牙拔掉一颗
Lastly... take out one of his teeth

980
01:17:39,287 --> 01:17:41,448
不干就不干，我才不跟你闲扯淡
Fine if you're not interested

981
01:17:41,857 --> 01:17:43,552
还真以为天下的男人都死光了
You think you're the last man on earth?

982
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:44,819
这样让她知难而退
She will give up now

983
01:17:44,926 --> 01:17:46,757
你就不必在这边为难了
And you won't be caught in the middle

984
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:53,327
有什么了不起
No big deal

985
01:17:53,435 --> 01:17:56,871
天下无难事，只怕有心人
When there's a will, there's a way

986
01:17:56,972 --> 01:17:58,906
告诉他，叫他等着瞧好了
Tell him to wait and see

987
01:18:05,814 --> 01:18:06,644
小玉
Xiaoyu

988
01:18:06,748 --> 01:18:07,305
干嘛？
Yes?

989
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:08,474
你来
Come here

990
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:09,447
我没空
I'm busy

991
01:18:11,787 --> 01:18:12,685
我没空
I'm busy

992
01:18:26,501 --> 01:18:28,025
比也是白比
You're a champ

993
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:37,870
胡子留两揪，馄饨四两九
I love my moustache

994
01:18:38,146 --> 01:18:41,377
胡子多几根，餐餐炒肉碎
Dense & thick. Great, isn't it!

995
01:18:44,419 --> 01:18:45,386
德性
Look at you

996
01:18:52,294 --> 01:18:56,424
一个人什么都能有，就是不能有病
One can have anything except sickness

997
01:18:56,898 --> 01:19:00,026
什么都能没有，就是不能没有钱
One can do without anything except money

998
01:19:00,702 --> 01:19:04,194
当然了，谁能比得上你邓洪发呢
Yes, you're quite a man

999
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:06,706
既有钱，又没病
Rich, healthy

1000
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:08,704
这有什么稀奇的？
What's so unusual about it?

1001
01:19:10,879 --> 01:19:12,642
像我这个岁数
People at my age...

1002
01:19:12,981 --> 01:19:14,573
有这么好牙口的能有几个？
don't have the sturdy teeth I have

1003
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:15,982
我不是吹牛
I'm not bluffing

1004
01:19:16,451 --> 01:19:18,715
我这一辈子就没坐过牙医生的椅子
I've never been to a dentist

1005
01:19:20,055 --> 01:19:22,580
再说这胡子多没有用呀
And for my moustache...

1006
01:19:22,924 --> 01:19:24,221
要根根见肉
It's unique too

1007
01:19:24,559 --> 01:19:28,051
多一根则多，少一根则少
You'll need to have the right amount

1008
01:19:28,163 --> 01:19:31,223
大姐，你可知道吗？
You know?

1009
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:47,242
好，真不错，冠军就是冠军
Good, champion is champion

1010
01:19:47,983 --> 01:19:48,711
怎么样？
So?

1011
01:19:48,817 --> 01:19:51,285
不错…真不愧为冠军
Good, it's the champion

1012
01:19:51,887 --> 01:19:53,445
我早就说过
I've told you so

1013
01:19:53,555 --> 01:19:55,489
你们比也是白比，是不是呀？
It's clear who's the winner, right?

1014
01:19:55,590 --> 01:19:56,887
是…
Yes...

1015
01:19:57,159 --> 01:19:59,093
龙就是龙，凤就是凤
So impressive

1016
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:00,223
你们说对不对？
What do you say?

1017
01:20:00,328 --> 01:20:02,023
当然…
Of course...

1018
01:20:03,498 --> 01:20:05,932
还有，它每天都要洗澡
Needs to be cleaned everyday

1019
01:20:06,034 --> 01:20:07,092
矫情极了
So spoiled

1020
01:20:07,202 --> 01:20:10,035
一天不给它洗澡就发脾气
Or he'll be in a bad temper

1021
01:20:11,273 --> 01:20:12,501
真是的
So crazy

1022
01:20:12,774 --> 01:20:15,470
比我那个老婆还难伺候
More demanding than my wife

1023
01:20:20,081 --> 01:20:22,777
真是难伺候，矫情
So spoiled

1024
01:20:23,185 --> 01:20:24,311
不错
Right...

1025
01:20:24,419 --> 01:20:25,886
真是矫情
Exactly

1026
01:20:26,521 --> 01:20:27,783
看着…
Look

1027
01:20:46,274 --> 01:20:48,708
你们看，正康熙的
Look, from Emperor Kangxi

1028
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:50,810
这几个玩意
These accessories

1029
01:20:50,912 --> 01:20:54,439
就已经花了我两千八百块
I've spent a fortune on them

1030
01:20:54,749 --> 01:20:56,512
一分钱一分货
But they're worth it

1031
01:20:56,618 --> 01:20:59,553
前几天天宝齐有个鸟笼要卖
I saw a bird cage a few days ago

1032
01:20:59,654 --> 01:21:01,849
两万六千块
Twenty six thousand dollars

1033
01:21:02,157 --> 01:21:02,714
两万六？
Twenty six thousand!

1034
01:21:02,824 --> 01:21:04,724
是呀，够买大洋楼的了
One could buy a house with that

1035
01:21:04,826 --> 01:21:06,259
他说是乾隆的珍玩
He said it belonged to the Emperor Qianlong

1036
01:21:06,361 --> 01:21:07,453
有花宫窑的瓷壶
It's the best porcelain

1037
01:21:07,562 --> 01:21:09,325
还有石尘老人的印
With the seal of the famous artist

1038
01:21:12,267 --> 01:21:13,131
你干什么？
What are you doing?

1039
01:21:13,235 --> 01:21:13,826
干什么？
What?

1040
01:21:20,442 --> 01:21:22,740
你…你疯了
Are you mad?

1041
01:21:22,844 --> 01:21:24,903
我疯了，我是疯了
Yes I am

1042
01:21:25,647 --> 01:21:27,706
我告诉你，自从嫁给你
Since we got married...

1043
01:21:27,816 --> 01:21:29,283
没一天好日子过
I haven't had one good day

1044
01:21:29,384 --> 01:21:31,147
大老婆活着受大老婆的气
I had to take nonsense from your dead wife before

1045
01:21:31,253 --> 01:21:33,448
大老婆死了受你这畜牲的气
And now I have to deal with you!

1046
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,022
受你这畜牲的气
I can't stand it

1047
01:21:35,991 --> 01:21:40,860
谁给气你受了？这是冠军哪
This is the champion

1048
01:21:41,763 --> 01:21:43,526
我的冠军哪
My champ

1049
01:21:45,800 --> 01:21:46,926
冠军？
The champion?

1050
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:53,397
在你眼里它是冠军
He is the champ in your eyes

1051
01:21:54,442 --> 01:21:57,002
每天天没亮你去遛它
You spend time with him everyday

1052
01:21:57,112 --> 01:22:00,377
给它买康熙的壶，每天给它洗澡
Wash him and feed him

1053
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:02,482
你怎么不带我出去遛？
Why don't you spend some time with me?

1054
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:03,778
你怎么不给我买康熙壶？
Why don't you buy antiques for me?

1055
01:22:03,885 --> 01:22:04,909
怎么不给我洗澡？
Why don't you bathe me?

1056
01:22:05,020 --> 01:22:06,783
你是娶老婆还是娶鸟？
Are you married to your wife or the bird?

1057
01:22:09,391 --> 01:22:10,756
我命好苦
I have a tough life

1058
01:22:15,997 --> 01:22:17,726
我的天
What a bitter life!

1059
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:21,198
你看…她跟鸟还吃醋呢
I mean, see... she's jealous

1060
01:22:21,870 --> 01:22:25,271
这是你的福气嘛，爱呀
I'd say you're blessed, it's love

1061
01:22:25,373 --> 01:22:25,839
爱？
Love?

1062
01:22:25,941 --> 01:22:26,873
爱
Love

1063
01:22:30,845 --> 01:22:33,336
太太，好了…
My dear, well...

1064
01:22:33,448 --> 01:22:37,009
好什么？以后再养鸟咱们就离婚
What now? We'll get a divorce if you keep the birds

1065
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:40,085
太太…你…
You...

1066
01:22:40,188 --> 01:22:43,316
太太吃醋了，这就是爱情
She is jealous. That's what is love, you know

1067
01:22:44,693 --> 01:22:46,593
爱情？她这一爱
Love?

1068
01:22:46,695 --> 01:22:48,526
我这两千八百块就玩完了
I've wasted my money

1069
01:22:55,337 --> 01:22:57,999
根根见肉，延年益寿
Great moustache, good for longevity

1070
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:02,100
老板，这是上个月的总帐目
Boss, here are the accounts from last month

1071
01:23:02,410 --> 01:23:03,274
请您过目
Please take a look

1072
01:23:03,712 --> 01:23:05,179
交给太太去
Pass this to the lady

1073
01:23:09,451 --> 01:23:10,440
太太，请您过目
Madam, please take a look

1074
01:23:10,552 --> 01:23:11,746
等一等，你再说一遍
Wait, say that again

1075
01:23:12,053 --> 01:23:16,046
天上一只鹅，地下一只鹅
A goose in the sky, a goose on the ground

1076
01:23:16,157 --> 01:23:19,524
我吃鹅蛋，我变鹅
I eat an goose egg, I become the goose

1077
01:23:19,627 --> 01:23:24,621
天上一只鹅，地下一只鹅
A goose in the sky, a goose on the ground

1078
01:23:24,733 --> 01:23:29,898
我吃鹅蛋，我变鹅
I eat an goose egg, I become the goose

1079
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:34,168
那你再听我说说看，对不对？
Listen to me

1080
01:23:34,709 --> 01:23:36,643
这么两句你都不会说，真笨
You've got it wrong, so silly

1081
01:23:37,045 --> 01:23:39,343
什么？听的容易
What? It sounds easy

1082
01:23:40,849 --> 01:23:42,077
不信，你试试看
Try it yourself

1083
01:23:42,617 --> 01:23:43,276
你听着
Listen

1084
01:23:43,385 --> 01:23:44,181
等会儿
Hold on

1085
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,246
你说不上来呢？
If you can't memorize it...

1086
01:23:46,621 --> 01:23:47,610
怎么样？杀头呀
What? I get beheaded?

1087
01:23:47,922 --> 01:23:49,913
那倒不必，我们要罚你
No, but we'll punish you

1088
01:23:50,258 --> 01:23:51,418
我说上了是不是有赏呀？
Do I get rewarded if I get it right?

1089
01:23:51,526 --> 01:23:52,117
当然了
Of course...

1090
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:53,319
怎么赏法？
How?

1091
01:23:53,828 --> 01:23:57,195
这样吧，今天我大开方便之门
I'll be generous

1092
01:23:57,298 --> 01:23:59,061
要是你说的一字不差
If you can get it right

1093
01:23:59,167 --> 01:24:02,898
我就叫小玉亲亲热热的给你亲一下
Xiaoyu will smother you with a kiss

1094
01:24:04,339 --> 01:24:05,135
真的？
Really?

1095
01:24:07,609 --> 01:24:09,509
小玉，是不是啊？
Yes, Xiaoyu?

1096
01:24:11,212 --> 01:24:14,238
我先听听，说得不对怎么罚法
And the punishment?

1097
01:24:14,582 --> 01:24:15,879
说得不对
If you get it wrong

1098
01:24:15,984 --> 01:24:18,248
每一次拔老爷的胡子一根
A hair plucked from your moustache each time

1099
01:24:19,087 --> 01:24:20,952
拔胡子？那怎么行？
Pluck my moustache? No way

1100
01:24:21,589 --> 01:24:22,385
那我也不干
Then I won't kiss you

1101
01:24:22,490 --> 01:24:24,185
你一毛不拔，谁叫你亲？
If you refuse

1102
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:26,852
好…咱们君子一言
Fine, it's a deal

1103
01:24:27,262 --> 01:24:30,561
郭子祥，你作证
Guo Zixiang, you're our witness

1104
01:24:32,801 --> 01:24:33,825
你先说一遍
Repeat it

1105
01:24:33,935 --> 01:24:37,769
天上一只鹅，地下一只鹅
A goose in the sky, a goose on the ground

1106
01:24:37,872 --> 01:24:40,966
我吃鹅蛋，我变鹅
I eat an goose egg, I become the goose

1107
01:24:41,810 --> 01:24:42,674
简单得很
It's simple

1108
01:24:43,445 --> 01:24:44,207
等一会
Hold on

1109
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:47,241
咱们可是君子一言，不准赖的
You must keep your word

1110
01:24:48,216 --> 01:24:50,946
小玉，听见了没有？不准赖的
Xiaoyu, you too

1111
01:24:51,453 --> 01:24:52,385
你说嘛
Go on

1112
01:24:55,223 --> 01:24:59,319
一二三
One, two, three

1113
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:04,364
天上一只鹅，地下一只鹅
A goose in the sky, a goose on the ground

1114
01:25:04,466 --> 01:25:06,661
我吃鹅…
I eat the goose...

1115
01:25:07,469 --> 01:25:09,937
我吃鹅干什么呢？不算…
I eat the goose? That didn't count

1116
01:25:10,038 --> 01:25:12,063
不行…说话怎么不算数呀
No way

1117
01:25:12,807 --> 01:25:13,739
先记着嘛
Drop it down

1118
01:25:13,842 --> 01:25:16,174
不行，本小利微概不赊欠
No

1119
01:25:16,277 --> 01:25:17,437
真拔？
You'll do this for real?

1120
01:25:17,545 --> 01:25:19,638
还客气？小玉，过来拔
Come on, Xiaoyu

1121
01:25:20,148 --> 01:25:20,978
好
Sure

1122
01:25:21,883 --> 01:25:22,406
真拔？
You'll really pull?

1123
01:25:22,517 --> 01:25:24,144
你别想赖，不行
Don't try to get away with it

1124
01:25:32,594 --> 01:25:33,526
来吧，再说吧
Come on, again

1125
01:25:34,262 --> 01:25:36,822
听着，天上…
Listen...

1126
01:25:36,931 --> 01:25:42,267
等等…天上一只鹅，地下一只鹅
A goose in the sky, a goose on the ground

1127
01:25:42,370 --> 01:25:44,497
鹅…玩完
Goose... over

1128
01:25:45,473 --> 01:25:47,600
又拔一根，来吧…
Another one, come on

1129
01:25:49,377 --> 01:25:50,139
要拔拔这边
This side

1130
01:25:50,245 --> 01:25:51,678
这一边多一边少，多难看哪
It has to be even

1131
01:25:56,818 --> 01:25:58,080
你再说一遍
One more go

1132
01:25:58,186 --> 01:25:58,948
听着
Listen well

1133
01:25:59,821 --> 01:26:03,917
天上一只鹅，地下一只鹅
A goose in the sky, a goose on the ground

1134
01:26:04,025 --> 01:26:06,323
我吃鹅蛋，我变鹅
I eat an goose egg, I become the goose

1135
01:26:06,427 --> 01:26:09,123
我吃…我吃鹅蛋干什么呢？真是
I eat... a goose egg?

1136
01:26:09,230 --> 01:26:11,562
不算…我认输了…我不来了
I give up, not again

1137
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:13,827
那不行，你得再拔一根
No, the last one

1138
01:26:13,935 --> 01:26:15,459
小玉，来
Xiaoyu, come on

1139
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:17,003
又拔，要拔拔中间
Pluck from the middle

1140
01:26:24,512 --> 01:26:25,809
好端端的拔什么胡子呢？
What did you do that for?

1141
01:26:26,447 --> 01:26:28,415
小玉，给老爷一个安慰奖
Xiaoyu, be good

1142
01:26:28,516 --> 01:26:29,505
让他亲一下吧
Let him kiss you

1143
01:26:29,884 --> 01:26:30,612
好吧
All right

1144
01:26:38,226 --> 01:26:39,022
来
Come on

1145
01:26:40,662 --> 01:26:41,594
好臭
It stinks

1146
01:26:41,696 --> 01:26:42,060
你说什么？
Excuse me?

1147
01:26:42,163 --> 01:26:44,188
老爷的嘴里头有股味
The master has bad breath

1148
01:26:44,299 --> 01:26:47,029
胡说八道，我嘴会有味，你闻闻
No way! You smell it

1149
01:26:48,703 --> 01:26:49,897
怎么样？我嘴有味吗？
So?

1150
01:26:51,072 --> 01:26:52,369
我是已经闻惯了
I think I'm used to it

1151
01:26:52,473 --> 01:26:53,872
你自己闻不到就是了
I don't notice it anymore

1152
01:26:54,709 --> 01:26:55,937
我早就想告诉你
I've wanted to tell you since long

1153
01:26:56,044 --> 01:26:57,705
以前我爸爸也有这个毛病
My father had the same problem

1154
01:26:57,812 --> 01:26:58,608
后来一检查
After he went to the dentist

1155
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:01,113
一颗大牙整个都烂空了
...it was discovered that he had cavities

1156
01:27:02,517 --> 01:27:03,677
我的牙…
My tooth...

1157
01:27:28,443 --> 01:27:29,467
疼不疼？
It hurts?

1158
01:27:29,577 --> 01:27:31,044
怎么不疼？
Of course...

1159
01:27:32,947 --> 01:27:34,539
现在好点了吗？
Better now?

1160
01:27:37,185 --> 01:27:38,652
好点了
A little

1161
01:27:41,022 --> 01:27:42,421
拿给我看看
Let's have a look

1162
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:44,589
拿过来
Pass it

1163
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:50,056
靠近点
Closer

1164
01:27:50,565 --> 01:27:52,032
这样好吗？
Better now?

1165
01:28:00,808 --> 01:28:02,605
这是我的牙？
My tooth?

1166
01:28:03,044 --> 01:28:04,477
不像是我的牙
It doesn't look like mine

1167
01:28:05,713 --> 01:28:07,010
不是你的，是谁的？
Of course it's yours

1168
01:28:07,315 --> 01:28:10,011
怎么？你嘴里长出象牙来吗？
It's your tooth

1169
01:28:10,118 --> 01:28:11,642
那我不成了狗了吗？
Am I a dog?

1170
01:28:12,987 --> 01:28:14,477
这牙不像是我的
It doesn't look like mine

1171
01:28:15,156 --> 01:28:16,214
怎么会呢？
Of course it's yours

1172
01:28:16,324 --> 01:28:18,690
拔出来的牙都是这样子的
They all look the same

1173
01:28:29,437 --> 01:28:32,600
牙疼不算病，疼起来真要命
It hurts

1174
01:28:34,642 --> 01:28:35,939
还有没有味？
Any smell?

1175
01:28:39,213 --> 01:28:40,180
有呀
Yes

1176
01:28:41,582 --> 01:28:42,947
药味嘛
Smells like medicine

1177
01:28:46,387 --> 01:28:48,014
慢慢就没有了
Gradually it'll be okay

1178
01:29:01,936 --> 01:29:02,960
不行，我还是不敢
No, I'm still worried

1179
01:29:03,871 --> 01:29:05,338
这回你可要我好看了
I'm looking forward to it

1180
01:29:09,477 --> 01:29:10,603
好人难做
I'm just trying to be a good guy

1181
01:29:12,246 --> 01:29:14,146
这么着吧，再出个题目
How about another problem?

1182
01:29:14,882 --> 01:29:15,871
还出题目？
Another one?

1183
01:29:16,384 --> 01:29:17,715
难倒她就算了
Just trying to back her off

1184
01:29:18,453 --> 01:29:19,511
告诉她，有本事的
Tell her that

1185
01:29:19,620 --> 01:29:20,882
叫她当着老爷的面
In front of the master

1186
01:29:20,988 --> 01:29:21,750
当着老爷的面？
In front of the master?

1187
01:29:21,856 --> 01:29:22,914
当着老爷的面干什么？
Do what?

1188
01:29:23,224 --> 01:29:24,122
她想干什么？
Whatever she wants to do

1189
01:29:26,227 --> 01:29:28,354
你叫她跟你当着老爷的面…
In front of the master?

1190
01:29:30,131 --> 01:29:31,826
好题目，亏你想得出
I'm impressed

1191
01:29:32,500 --> 01:29:37,733
好，只要他说得出我就做得到
Fine, I'll do it

1192
01:29:44,412 --> 01:29:46,676
不过有一样，他要照我的话去做
He must go with the flow though

1193
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:48,505
后天是观音诞
It's the Guanyin Festival the day after

1194
01:30:22,450 --> 01:30:26,250
你看，树上的那些梨那么大了
Look, the pears are huge

1195
01:30:26,854 --> 01:30:27,878
还生着呢
Still not ripe yet

1196
01:30:27,989 --> 01:30:29,320
我想吃嘛
I want to eat

1197
01:30:29,891 --> 01:30:31,415
生梨怎么能吃呢？
It's not time yet

1198
01:30:31,526 --> 01:30:32,857
我喜欢嘛
I like it

1199
01:30:33,161 --> 01:30:34,287
你真任性
You're really wayward

1200
01:30:35,396 --> 01:30:37,489
郭子祥，谢谢你帮我做件事
Guo Zixiang, help me out

1201
01:30:37,598 --> 01:30:39,793
上树去摘点梨来
Go get some pears

1202
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:06,117
员外…你们…
Boss, you...

1203
01:31:06,527 --> 01:31:09,826
你们光天化日之下怎么可以这样呢
How could you do this here?

1204
01:31:12,333 --> 01:31:12,765
我们怎么了？
What about us?

1205
01:31:12,867 --> 01:31:13,356
怎么了？
What's wrong?

1206
01:31:13,468 --> 01:31:14,264
我们怎么了倒是？
What's wrong with us?

1207
01:31:14,368 --> 01:31:16,165
你们…
You...

1208
01:31:16,270 --> 01:31:18,898
今天是观音诞你们不怕得罪佛爷
Today is the Guanyin Festival

1209
01:31:19,006 --> 01:31:21,839
光天化日之下，这…
and you're like this here...

1210
01:31:22,477 --> 01:31:26,277
我们怎么了？你下来…
What? Get down here...

1211
01:31:33,588 --> 01:31:34,612
怎么了？
What's going on?

1212
01:31:34,722 --> 01:31:37,987
这…真是奇怪了
This... it's strange

1213
01:31:38,092 --> 01:31:38,717
奇怪什么？
What?

1214
01:31:38,826 --> 01:31:40,760
员外，你怎么又穿上衣服了
You're wearing clothes again?

1215
01:31:40,862 --> 01:31:42,693
我怎么没穿衣服？你有毛病呀
Of course I'm dressed, are you crazy?

1216
01:31:43,097 --> 01:31:44,121
我穿着好好衣服的
I'm dressed

1217
01:31:44,232 --> 01:31:45,494
你说我没有穿衣服？
You said I was naked?

1218
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,727
这棵树…
This tree...

1219
01:31:47,835 --> 01:31:48,631
这棵树怎么了？
What about it?

1220
01:31:48,736 --> 01:31:50,169
员外你不信，你上去看看
You should go take a look yourself

1221
01:31:50,271 --> 01:31:52,501
我…
I...

1222
01:31:52,607 --> 01:31:53,596
我扶你上去
Let me help you

1223
01:32:54,368 --> 01:32:57,269
你们…你们干什么？
What are you doing?

1224
01:32:57,705 --> 01:33:00,105
干什么？我们不是好好的嘛
What? We aren't doing anything

1225
01:33:17,992 --> 01:33:20,460
你们…你们怎么可以？
How could you?

1226
01:33:28,836 --> 01:33:36,242
这…淫树…
This is a tree of sin...

1227
01:33:38,479 --> 01:33:40,037
妙，妙极了
Excellent trick

1228
01:33:42,383 --> 01:33:45,841
后来那个老家伙每天疯疯癫癫的
Then the old man went berserk

1229
01:33:45,953 --> 01:33:47,887
没多久就魂归天国了
...and died soon after

1230
01:33:48,255 --> 01:33:49,279
那管楼的呢？
What about the young man?

1231
01:33:50,257 --> 01:33:52,191
小白脸可真没好心眼
Heartless man

1232
01:33:52,827 --> 01:33:54,317
看着傻里傻气的
He might seem silly...

1233
01:33:54,428 --> 01:33:57,329
其实呀，可坏着呢
but actually he's up to no good

1234
01:33:57,431 --> 01:33:57,863
怎么了？
What did he do?

1235
01:33:57,965 --> 01:33:59,057
跟小玉来了个卷包会
He and Xiaoyu

1236
01:33:59,166 --> 01:34:00,463
两个人一块儿跑了
...they ran away together

1237
01:34:00,568 --> 01:34:02,502
人心隔肚皮呀
Terrible!

1238
01:34:02,603 --> 01:34:03,433
金宝姑娘
Miss Jinbao

1239
01:34:05,106 --> 01:34:06,437
小王先生来了
Mr. Wang is here

1240
01:34:06,540 --> 01:34:07,837
小王？哪个小王？
Who? Which one?

1241
01:34:08,342 --> 01:34:10,207
就是拔牙的那位
The one who took out his tooth

1242
01:34:10,311 --> 01:34:11,243
真的？
Really?

1243
01:34:16,984 --> 01:34:19,953
金宝…
Jinbao...

1244
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:24,920
金宝
Jinbao...

1245
01:34:30,297 --> 01:34:32,094
金宝
Jinbao...

1246
01:34:33,067 --> 01:34:34,295
你是哪位？
Who are you?

1247
01:34:36,637 --> 01:34:37,399
您贵姓？
What's your name?

1248
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:39,302
怎么了？你连我都不认识了？
Don't you recognize me?

1249
01:34:40,474 --> 01:34:42,305
我们这儿有奶就是娘
Any woman could be my mother here

1250
01:34:42,710 --> 01:34:46,146
有钱就是大爷，没钱哪…
Any rich man could be my customer, poor man...

1251
01:34:49,383 --> 01:34:52,750
金宝…
Jinbao...

1252
01:34:52,853 --> 01:34:54,753
我知道，你一定怪我去得太久了
I know I've left for too long

1253
01:34:54,855 --> 01:34:57,517
其实我一到了上海马上就往回赶
I came back as soon as possible

1254
01:34:57,625 --> 01:34:59,559
你要我买的东西我全买齐了
I've bought everything you wanted from Shanghai

1255
01:34:59,894 --> 01:35:02,124
钱也带来了，可是，可是我…
and the money, but I...

1256
01:35:02,229 --> 01:35:04,823
可是，半路上遇见强盗了，是吗？
You got robbed on the way, right?

1257
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:07,098
你怎么知道的？
How did you know?

1258
01:35:08,169 --> 01:35:10,137
这故事又不是第一次听到
Well, I have heard the story before

1259
01:35:10,237 --> 01:35:11,363
你以为好新鲜吗？
An old tale, huh?

1260
01:35:11,739 --> 01:35:13,206
这是真的，你不信呀？
It's the truth, you don't believe?

1261
01:35:14,175 --> 01:35:17,406
谁说我不信？好了，到此为止了
Yes, I believe you. It's over

1262
01:35:18,179 --> 01:35:19,703
你二伯的关王庙
Do me a favor

1263
01:35:19,814 --> 01:35:21,076
你找玉堂春唱去吧
Find another Juliet

1264
01:35:21,449 --> 01:35:22,916
我可没功夫陪你了
I've no time for you

1265
01:35:24,085 --> 01:35:26,246
怎么，你忘了？你忘了我
Have you forgotten about me?

1266
01:35:27,354 --> 01:35:29,481
难道你忘了你的头发？
What about your hair?

1267
01:35:32,526 --> 01:35:34,153
你可真死心眼
C'mon, give me a break

1268
01:35:35,463 --> 01:35:36,862
怎么了，假的？
What? It's fake?

1269
01:35:36,964 --> 01:35:37,862
真的？
Really?

1270
01:35:38,199 --> 01:35:39,826
要都是真的，风月楼的姑娘
If that's for real...

1271
01:35:39,934 --> 01:35:41,458
不个个都变成秃子了吗？
then all the girls here would be bald

1272
01:35:47,808 --> 01:35:48,934
那我的牙呢？
What about my tooth?

1273
01:35:51,178 --> 01:35:53,476
说来说去，还是为了你的牙
You want it back?

1274
01:35:53,848 --> 01:35:54,974
早说嘛
Should have told me sooner

1275
01:35:55,750 --> 01:35:59,584
王大爷，天若有情天亦老
Mr. Wang

1276
01:36:00,554 --> 01:36:01,919
看开一点吧
Oh, cheer up

1277
01:36:06,694 --> 01:36:08,093
您自个儿挑吧
Pick it yourself

1278
01:36:21,175 --> 01:36:23,109
我们的牙
Our teeth!

1279
01:36:23,677 --> 01:36:25,941
见客了
Come out and greet the guests

1280
01:36:26,046 --> 01:36:30,346
楼上楼下，前院后院的姑娘们
Girls from upstairs, downstairs, front and backyards

1281
