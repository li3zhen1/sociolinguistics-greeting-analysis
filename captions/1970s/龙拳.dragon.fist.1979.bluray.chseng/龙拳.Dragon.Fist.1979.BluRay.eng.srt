Master, it's here.

11
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:14,649
SUPREME MARTIAL ARTIST

12
00:05:24,284 --> 00:05:25,724
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

13
00:05:25,785 --> 00:05:30,039
I am humbled to have the martial artists Present here bestowing the honor.

14
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:31,371
I'm abashed to receive it.

15
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,003
Chong's martial arts are peerless. We are in such admiration.

16
00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:37,088
You're too kind.

17
00:05:37,922 --> 00:05:39,924
- Bring the board over. - Hold on.'

18
00:05:42,010 --> 00:05:43,010
Chong Saam-taai,

19
00:05:43,469 --> 00:05:45,680
you wouldn't have expected me, Chung Gim-gwan, to come.

20
00:05:50,977 --> 00:05:54,647
So it's Mr Chung. My apologies. Please.

21
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,325
I'm not here for a drink.

22
00:06:05,742 --> 00:06:07,952
- You're here for...? - I want this board.

23
00:06:08,703 --> 00:06:11,789
Senior Chung, this board was won by my master in a martial arts competition.

24
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:13,541
Martial arts competition?

25
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:15,501
He hasn't competed with me.

26
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,757
Mr Chung, the competition has finished. You'll have to wait for the next one.

27
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:22,925
I'm already here.

28
00:06:23,468 --> 00:06:26,846
If you refuse to compete with me and proceed to hang that sign,

29
00:06:27,388 --> 00:06:28,431
it would have no honor.

30
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:30,933
- What's so special about you? - Impudent'.

31
00:06:31,476 --> 00:06:33,853
Don't be so rude to Mr Chung.

32
00:06:34,395 --> 00:06:38,191
Senior Chung, if you think your junior isn't qualified to hang this board up...

33
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:41,194
Right, that's what I'm saying.

34
00:06:41,486 --> 00:06:45,823
Only if you can beat my Tam's Kick, you can have the board.

35
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,325
You're too much.

36
00:06:47,617 --> 00:06:50,161
If you insist on competing, your junior must honor this.

37
00:06:51,204 --> 00:06:52,246
Master.

38
00:07:56,561 --> 00:07:57,687
Master.

39
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:42,773
- Master. - Good Kung Fu.

40
00:08:52,033 --> 00:08:53,784
Stop fighting. Enough.

41
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,621
Dad.

42
00:08:57,163 --> 00:08:59,207
Do you really want to kill him?

43
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:07,965
Stop it.

44
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:10,551
Master.

45
00:09:11,093 --> 00:09:12,637
Let him have the board.

46
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:22,271
I see that board has no use either.

47
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:52,343
Are you okay?

48
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:00,434
Not fair.

49
00:10:01,143 --> 00:10:02,353
Not fair.

50
00:10:03,062 --> 00:10:06,357
I had conceded defeat yet he kept attacking.

51
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:10,902
Huo-wan.

52
00:10:11,237 --> 00:10:12,321
Huo-wan,

53
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:14,740
I know I'm dying.

54
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:21,247
You must take good care of your sister and mistress.

55
00:10:23,374 --> 00:10:27,378
This is a grave injustice. I'll not die in peace.

56
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:30,548
Master, you'll be fine.

57
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:34,677
I'll certainly practise my martial arts and take revenge for you.

58
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:38,931
Restoring the reputation of Tong Saan Martial Arts School...

59
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:43,853
all depends on you.

60
00:10:45,104 --> 00:10:46,439
Dad.

61
00:10:46,731 --> 00:10:48,149
- Dad. - Master!

62
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,277
CHAMPION AREA

63
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,783
- This way, please. - Please sit down.

64
00:11:00,911 --> 00:11:02,496
Please take a seat.

65
00:11:04,582 --> 00:11:07,627
That was easy, insignificant.

66
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,630
But it finally won an honor for the Place.

67
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:12,839
Cau-ping.

68
00:11:13,674 --> 00:11:16,886
All the guests have arrived. You go and ask your mum to come.

69
00:11:17,762 --> 00:11:18,762
Understood.

70
00:11:34,278 --> 00:11:38,282
Mum, all the guests are here. Dad is asking you to come out quickly.

71
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:45,289
Mum.

72
00:11:51,629 --> 00:11:53,047
Dad, come here quick.

73
00:11:53,464 --> 00:11:54,840
Come here quick.

74
00:11:56,217 --> 00:11:58,719
- What is it? - Quick, come and see for yourself.

75
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:01,263
Quickly. Come on.

76
00:12:01,847 --> 00:12:02,932
Come over.

77
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:05,059
Quickly!

78
00:12:08,896 --> 00:12:10,940
- What's happened? - Look.

79
00:12:14,652 --> 00:12:15,945
What's happened?

80
00:12:18,823 --> 00:12:20,241
Mum, she's...

81
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,727
<i>My dear husband,</i>

82
00:12:48,144 --> 00:12:49,944
<i>You made a reprisal because you were aggrieved</i>

83
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,940
about a mutual love between Chong Saam-taai and I 18 years ago,

84
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:56,777
<i>even using a martial arts competition as a private means of killing Saam-taai.</i>

85
00:12:57,069 --> 00:12:58,904
<i>Where is your conscience?</i>

86
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:02,658
<i>Because I love you, I've given my life as a means of persuasion.</i>

87
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,845
<i>I hope you exercise forbearance for the sake of yourself</i>

88
00:13:04,869 --> 00:13:06,620
<i>and become chivalrous.</i>

89
00:13:07,037 --> 00:13:10,207
<i>I can then rest in peace.</i>

90
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:12,293
<i>My last letter, Sau-Sau.</i>

91
00:14:24,782 --> 00:14:28,744
Sir, we come here to work. We didn't do it on purpose.

92
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:30,579
Sir, you mustn't misunderstand.

93
00:14:31,205 --> 00:14:33,123
It's just your misfortune.

94
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:34,625
Who told you to see it?

95
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:38,128
Sir, don't! Sir!

96
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:50,891
- Quickly. Find it quick! - Yes.

97
00:14:54,478 --> 00:14:55,938
- Search everywhere! - Okay.

98
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:08,409
- Well? Is there anything? - Big Brother, the goods are here.

99
00:15:09,952 --> 00:15:12,079
- Quickly. - Come on, let's have a look!

100
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,248
Fish it out quickly. Hurry.

101
00:15:15,499 --> 00:15:16,625
- Hurry. - Okay.

102
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:26,589
- Got it. - Bring it ashore.

103
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:41,901
- Hey, can you see it? - Look over there.

104
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:46,196
- That's a corpse. Isn't it? - It looks like it.

105
00:15:46,947 --> 00:15:48,157
Quiet, everyone.

106
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:51,869
We'll bring it up first, then ask Master Chung what to do.

107
00:15:52,161 --> 00:15:53,361
- What do you say? - Good idea.

108
00:15:53,537 --> 00:15:54,955
Good idea? Let's go, then.

109
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,759
EAST COURT

110
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,376
Stop.

111
00:17:22,668 --> 00:17:25,308
It's a spar between brothers. How can you use such vicious attacks?

112
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:28,549
Big Brother, I'm sorry.

113
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:36,098
Master, Laam-ceng's Kung Fu has quickly improved.

114
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:40,352
If I called too late, he'd have broken your leg.

115
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:43,981
Big Brother, is that true?

116
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:47,430
You will still lose after practising for three more years.

117
00:17:47,484 --> 00:17:50,195
But I Probably won't use vicious attacks like you.

118
00:17:51,697 --> 00:17:52,990
Fool.

119
00:17:53,532 --> 00:17:54,950
Go away and think.

120
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:57,786
- You go practise. - Yes.

121
00:18:06,712 --> 00:18:07,838
Put it down.

122
00:18:09,089 --> 00:18:10,089
Sir.

123
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:11,507
Look.

124
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:15,929
This is the sixth individual.

125
00:18:16,346 --> 00:18:18,849
Dad, it looks ruthless.

126
00:18:21,477 --> 00:18:25,147
Sir, these atrocious acts were surely committed by the Ngais.

127
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:27,375
You cannot speak recklessly.

128
00:18:27,399 --> 00:18:29,239
There's no evidence, you cannot slander others.

129
00:18:29,902 --> 00:18:30,902
I can be a witness.

130
00:18:31,361 --> 00:18:34,406
I saw the Ngais' Fatty Heoi kill this man.

131
00:18:35,616 --> 00:18:37,159
You're willing to be the witness?

132
00:18:37,618 --> 00:18:38,952
I dare to confront this.

133
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,706
This is intolerable.

134
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:44,665
Fong-gong.

135
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:46,251
Master.

136
00:18:46,543 --> 00:18:50,297
You go with Laam-ceng to the Ngais. Ask Fatty Heoi to come here and see me.

137
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:51,589
Yes.

138
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,134
- They're looking for Fatty Heoi? - Yes.

139
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:02,434
You're right, Fatty Heoi is my man.

140
00:19:02,726 --> 00:19:04,046
Why are you both looking for him?

141
00:19:04,103 --> 00:19:06,355
He's a murderer. Please hand him over.

142
00:19:07,523 --> 00:19:10,067
He killed someone? Who saw that?

143
00:19:10,526 --> 00:19:11,819
Of course we have a witness.

144
00:19:12,111 --> 00:19:13,821
We want him to come with us now to explain.

145
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:19,159
The Patience Clan has always been respectable here

146
00:19:19,451 --> 00:19:21,829
but you two are being very unreasonable now.

147
00:19:22,996 --> 00:19:25,916
Even if Fatty Heoi killed someone, you shouldn't come to me.

148
00:19:26,667 --> 00:19:27,751
He's one of the Ngais' men.

149
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:30,879
He's no longer working here.

150
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:32,421
Then where did he go?

151
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,590
Don't know.

152
00:19:34,967 --> 00:19:36,887
- I want you to hand the man over.' - Ridiculous!

153
00:19:37,594 --> 00:19:40,274
Where do you think you are? How can you conduct yourself recklessly?

154
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:46,435
What do you want to do?

155
00:19:49,148 --> 00:19:52,484
Gentlemen, don't be angry. Fatty Heoi really isn't here.

156
00:19:52,776 --> 00:19:54,576
There's no need for spoiling our relationship.

157
00:19:55,237 --> 00:19:58,282
If we find Fatty Heoi, you mustn't blame us if it gets uncivil.

158
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,577
It's up to you.

159
00:20:02,619 --> 00:20:04,079
- Yes. - Let's go.

160
00:20:07,082 --> 00:20:09,585
Big Brother, why don't we just destroy the Patience Clan now?

161
00:20:09,877 --> 00:20:10,877
What do you know?

162
00:20:10,961 --> 00:20:13,130
Patience Clan is respected by the people.

163
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:16,049
To destroy them, there must be a good excuse.

164
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:17,885
That's right.

165
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:21,680
It's not the right time yet. We mustn't be impatient.

166
00:20:21,972 --> 00:20:24,349
Wait until I've met Saam and made arrangements.

167
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,310
We'll sort him out later.

168
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,824
I'm quite worried we won't be able to find Chung later.

169
00:20:41,116 --> 00:20:42,326
Rest assured,

170
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:45,495
Chung's name is well-known, we can just ask.

171
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:49,082
Even if he can fly, I'll still hunt him down.

172
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:54,630
We've arrived.

173
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:25,911
- Move here. - No, I want to move here.

174
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:37,797
That girl is beautiful!

175
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:39,883
Young Master, come and take a look.

176
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:42,177
So beautiful!

177
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,012
- I'll talk to her. - I'm coming too!

178
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:45,721
Hey.

179
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:47,992
- Miss, you must have come from afar. - Go away. What are you doing?

180
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:49,476
- I'll help you. - No need.

181
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:50,768
I wasn't asking you.

182
00:21:52,062 --> 00:21:53,105
We're together.

183
00:22:00,696 --> 00:22:02,531
- What are you carrying? - You want to see?

184
00:22:02,990 --> 00:22:03,699
Yes.

185
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:06,493
Why don't you ask about the consequence of having a look?

186
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:09,496
- Then what is the Price? - I fear you can't afford it.

187
00:22:11,873 --> 00:22:13,333
You didn't ask around.

188
00:22:13,625 --> 00:22:15,919
There's isn't anything that we, the Ngais, can't afford.

189
00:22:16,253 --> 00:22:17,296
You really want to pay?

190
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:19,298
Tell me. How much?

191
00:22:20,132 --> 00:22:21,132
One leg!

192
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:23,427
A leg?!

193
00:22:25,971 --> 00:22:28,390
- So expensive. - We're not able to negotiate.

194
00:22:29,141 --> 00:22:30,183
Mistress, let's go.

195
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:42,321
What is it? A leg to have a look?

196
00:22:44,823 --> 00:22:45,823
Hey,

197
00:22:46,241 --> 00:22:48,952
- who is willing? - No, not me.

198
00:22:49,244 --> 00:22:50,244
How about you?

199
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:51,830
Me? I can't, my leg is...

200
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:55,167
- Yours. Let's go. - What are you afraid of? Let's go.

201
00:22:56,585 --> 00:22:58,503
- Hey. - Hey.

202
00:22:58,795 --> 00:22:59,838
Hold on.

203
00:23:01,048 --> 00:23:02,257
What is it this time?

204
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:05,552
Didn't you say you wanted one leg to have a look?

205
00:23:06,094 --> 00:23:07,346
I've brought one.

206
00:23:09,014 --> 00:23:10,891
Young Master, I don't want to see it.

207
00:23:11,558 --> 00:23:13,101
- It's you who wants to see it? - Yes.

208
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:14,728
- Then no. - Why?

209
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:17,180
Whoever looks at it would be the one who gives the leg.

210
00:23:19,649 --> 00:23:20,901
Do you want to see it?

211
00:23:21,401 --> 00:23:22,402
So what?

212
00:23:24,363 --> 00:23:26,281
You win.

213
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:28,700
We'll see it another day.

214
00:23:28,992 --> 00:23:30,452
- Let's go. - All right.

215
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:38,877
Huo-wan, we're far from home, you should be more tolerant.

216
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:40,921
Mum, don't blame brother.

217
00:23:41,213 --> 00:23:42,923
That man was very annoying.

218
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:45,092
Mum, where should we go now?

219
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:47,886
- To the Champion Clan's, of course. - There's no rush.

220
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:50,138
We should first look for a Place to stay.

221
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:53,141
Tomorrow is the third anniversary of your master's death.

222
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:56,079
I'm thinking about going to the temple to Pay my respects to him.

223
00:23:56,103 --> 00:23:58,772
Since we're here, staying a few days doesn't matter.

224
00:23:59,564 --> 00:24:00,690
Yes, Mistress.

225
00:24:00,982 --> 00:24:02,401
MING FU TEMPLE

226
00:25:04,463 --> 00:25:05,463
Brother,

227
00:25:06,006 --> 00:25:07,132
are you not feeling well?

228
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:11,070
So what are you doing? Is there something on your mind?

229
00:25:11,094 --> 00:25:12,971
What would be on my mind?

230
00:25:24,816 --> 00:25:25,816
Are you afraid?

231
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:28,111
Afraid?

232
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:32,324
To avenge the death of Master, to avenge the name of Tong SAAN,

233
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:34,868
I've never been afraid.

234
00:25:37,496 --> 00:25:41,374
So why has your manner completely changed since we arrived here?

235
00:25:42,792 --> 00:25:46,630
If you are afraid, it's not too late to turn back.

236
00:25:48,089 --> 00:25:49,299
You've misunderstood.

237
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:51,384
I indeed have something on my mind.

238
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:53,261
I'm worried about you and Mistress.

239
00:25:53,762 --> 00:25:56,264
Do you believe we're a burden to you?

240
00:25:56,556 --> 00:25:58,141
That's a further misunderstanding.

241
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:03,230
My worry is, if I lose to Chung Gim-gwan, who'll look after you both later?

242
00:26:03,939 --> 00:26:06,525
Rest assured, we'll look after ourselves.

243
00:26:07,984 --> 00:26:10,695
In short, you mustn't be demoralized.

244
00:26:11,613 --> 00:26:12,989
I won't be demoralized.

245
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:15,659
You look after Mistress, I'm going for a walk.

246
00:26:35,595 --> 00:26:37,835
- Young Master, that kid is here again. - Go and get him.

247
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:47,107
- Have you come from another Place? - Yes.

248
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:49,234
What have you come here to do?

249
00:26:49,526 --> 00:26:51,152
My affairs are no business of yours.

250
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:54,656
If you want to be here, you must follow the rules and regulations.

251
00:26:55,407 --> 00:26:56,807
What are the rules and regulations?

252
00:26:57,909 --> 00:26:59,661
To enter, you've to go through here.

253
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,499
To leave, you've to go through here.

254
00:27:06,001 --> 00:27:07,681
Who determined these rules and regulations?

255
00:27:08,336 --> 00:27:09,421
Young Master - myself.

256
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:11,171
You again.

257
00:27:11,298 --> 00:27:13,425
You want to come in or go out?

258
00:27:13,925 --> 00:27:16,386
I've no intention to incur hatred, nor be humiliated.

259
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,222
- Then let's be friends. - Friends?

260
00:27:19,514 --> 00:27:20,765
- Get him. - Don't go.

261
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:22,058
Stop.

262
00:27:23,643 --> 00:27:25,645
Ngai, you're too much.

263
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:28,398
The meddler's here.

264
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:33,153
I won't let you bully people. Let him go.

265
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:36,489
What business is it of yours? I wasn't bullying you.

266
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:37,941
I'm taking it as my business.

267
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:39,034
I won't let you.

268
00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:41,006
- Let him go. - Why should I listen to you?

269
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:44,205
Someone has just arrived in our town and hasn't offended you.

270
00:27:44,497 --> 00:27:45,915
Why must you bully People?

271
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:50,462
You're standing up against injustice? You're set on this kid?

272
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:53,256
You think you can bully this girl?

273
00:27:53,715 --> 00:27:54,715
Friend, you go on.

274
00:27:54,924 --> 00:27:58,094
- Go, go quickly! - Get him.

275
00:27:59,846 --> 00:28:01,348
Kid, don't you dare get involved.

276
00:29:07,789 --> 00:29:10,166
- Get him! - They're there.

277
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:40,613
- Let's go! - Let's go.

278
00:29:49,664 --> 00:29:51,082
I'm very thankful for your help.

279
00:29:51,374 --> 00:29:54,127
I'm Chung Cau-ping. May I ask your name?

280
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:56,921
If not your enemy, I'm your creditor.

281
00:29:57,797 --> 00:29:59,048
See you tomorrow.

282
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:04,345
What did he say? I don't understand.

283
00:30:06,055 --> 00:30:07,432
Why will he see me tomorrow?

284
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:09,058
I understand.

285
00:30:09,601 --> 00:30:11,019
Let's go back and inform Master.

286
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:39,923
- Master. - Master.

287
00:30:48,598 --> 00:30:49,598
- Master. - Master.

288
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:51,559
Everyone is here.

289
00:30:52,894 --> 00:30:56,189
If they're here, they'll certainly be looking for me,

290
00:30:56,815 --> 00:30:58,135
hence I have asked everyone here.

291
00:30:58,316 --> 00:30:59,556
There is something to tell you.

292
00:31:00,068 --> 00:31:02,737
Dad, he said he'd see me tomorrow.

293
00:31:04,364 --> 00:31:06,157
Then he definitely will come tomorrow.

294
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:10,036
If they're here, I don't want any of you to make things difficult for them.

295
00:31:10,578 --> 00:31:11,621
- Yes. - Yes.

296
00:31:14,999 --> 00:31:18,002
Master, your student doesn't understand what you're thinking.

297
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:20,713
- Inquisitive! - You don't need to ask.

298
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:23,258
Do as I say.

299
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:26,135
Even if they hit you, you're not to retaliate.

300
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:30,056
Dad, why? Should we be afraid?

301
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:32,433
I'm not afraid of them.

302
00:31:34,018 --> 00:31:35,645
It's that I owe them.

303
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:39,190
Big Brother, I've found out. He's here from Tong Saan.

304
00:31:39,482 --> 00:31:41,484
- Name is Tang Huo-wan. - Tong Saan?

305
00:31:41,776 --> 00:31:42,777
Yes, Saam told me.

306
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:45,780
Years ago, old man Chung wounded Chong Saam-taai

307
00:31:46,072 --> 00:31:48,342
and tore down the board of the Tong Saan Martial Arts School.

308
00:31:48,366 --> 00:31:49,450
He died from the anger.

309
00:31:49,742 --> 00:31:52,036
Coming here now, it's surely to get revenge.

310
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:54,622
No wonder that kid's martial arts is so good.

311
00:31:54,914 --> 00:31:56,624
He comes fully prepared.

312
00:31:57,417 --> 00:31:58,417
That's good then.

313
00:31:58,626 --> 00:32:01,588
Our brothers can just observe them fight each other.

314
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:04,757
Is his skill that good?

315
00:32:05,884 --> 00:32:07,594
I think he's better than Second Brother.

316
00:32:07,886 --> 00:32:09,053
Five of us took him on.

317
00:32:09,345 --> 00:32:12,348
Aside from being beaten, we couldn't even touch him.

318
00:32:12,891 --> 00:32:15,101
Is he that tremendous? Let me try.

319
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:17,395
Why bother?

320
00:32:17,687 --> 00:32:20,523
I think we should bribe him; he'll handle old man Chung.

321
00:32:20,815 --> 00:32:22,108
Wouldn't that be better?

322
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,485
Lou-Saam, I'll leave this to you.

323
00:32:25,194 --> 00:32:26,194
No problem.

324
00:32:26,446 --> 00:32:28,156
I'm the best at making crafty schemes.

325
00:32:28,448 --> 00:32:30,825
Hand me the matter, I'll take care of it.

326
00:32:53,848 --> 00:32:55,016
Brother, what are you doing?

327
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:58,603
- I've found the man we were looking for. - Huo-wan,

328
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:00,480
what are you waiting for?

329
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:04,776
We're not here to start a feud, we merely want justice.

330
00:33:05,526 --> 00:33:06,526
I understand.

331
00:33:06,611 --> 00:33:09,447
I'm only thinking about you and sister...

332
00:33:09,864 --> 00:33:11,032
We won't be a problem.

333
00:33:11,866 --> 00:33:14,243
Didn't I tell you before? You need not worry.

334
00:33:14,744 --> 00:33:17,956
As long as you beat the old man Chung, in revenge for dad,

335
00:33:18,623 --> 00:33:19,707
mum will be contented.

336
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:21,584
Huo-wan,

337
00:33:21,876 --> 00:33:25,338
so long as I witness you seeking justice,

338
00:33:26,297 --> 00:33:27,799
I can die in peace.

339
00:33:28,299 --> 00:33:29,419
You mustn't speak like this.

340
00:33:29,592 --> 00:33:31,302
It's my responsibility to avenge Master.

341
00:33:31,594 --> 00:33:33,596
When we go, please tell me.

342
00:33:33,888 --> 00:33:36,349
- Okay. We'll immediately go at dawn. - Yes.

343
00:34:09,549 --> 00:34:10,883
Mistress, we've arrived.

344
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:15,555
PATIENCE CLAN

345
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:26,190
- Can you announce our visit? - This way, Please.

346
00:34:44,333 --> 00:34:46,794
- Can you announce our visit? - This way, Please.

347
00:35:02,018 --> 00:35:03,436
This way, please.

348
00:35:15,656 --> 00:35:17,033
This way, please.

349
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:28,086
Madam Chong, please be seated.

350
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:30,838
You remember me?

351
00:35:31,589 --> 00:35:35,593
Though the incident happened years ago, I knew you would certainly come.

352
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:37,553
You understand why?

353
00:35:39,013 --> 00:35:40,013
I understand.

354
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:42,558
You must know what we want.

355
00:35:43,267 --> 00:35:45,812
Of course. This I know even more.

356
00:35:46,229 --> 00:35:46,896
Return it, then.

357
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:49,107
- I certainly will return it. - When?

358
00:35:49,398 --> 00:35:51,150
- Three days later. - Why?

359
00:35:51,651 --> 00:35:54,237
Because that day is an unforgettable one for me.

360
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:58,116
I hope on that day we can settle our grievances.

361
00:36:07,792 --> 00:36:09,460
What is it that you want?

362
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:13,172
Our Patience Clan will not be afraid of you.

363
00:36:13,714 --> 00:36:15,842
Cau-ping, don't speak out of turn.

364
00:36:17,677 --> 00:36:20,930
Would it be possible for the three of you to grant me three more days?

365
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:27,687
- You'll honor your words? - I promise.

366
00:36:27,979 --> 00:36:30,606
- Where? - Here.

367
00:36:30,898 --> 00:36:32,441
Right, we'll visit then.

368
00:36:33,526 --> 00:36:35,111
Mistress, let's go.

369
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:15,651
Why don't you sit down? Why are you walking around?

370
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:20,239
I'm just wondering why they scheduled it for three days later.

371
00:37:20,865 --> 00:37:22,074
I think it's strange too.

372
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:25,077
They have many people, you've got to be careful.

373
00:37:25,494 --> 00:37:26,871
I'm not afraid of them.

374
00:37:27,622 --> 00:37:30,583
If I can't restore the reputation of the Tong Saan Martial Arts School,

375
00:37:30,875 --> 00:37:31,875
I'll not go back.

376
00:37:33,336 --> 00:37:34,629
It's Mistress's voice.

377
00:37:39,717 --> 00:37:42,220
- Mistress, what is it? - Mum.

378
00:37:43,137 --> 00:37:45,473
So Painful.

379
00:37:50,937 --> 00:37:53,189
Mistress, what happened to you?

380
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:55,233
Mum.

381
00:37:57,235 --> 00:38:00,071
It feels very painful here.

382
00:38:00,863 --> 00:38:02,343
Why are you suddenly feeling painful?

383
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:03,783
I don't know.

384
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:08,704
After drinking that cup of tea, I started to feel a lot of pain here.

385
00:38:16,587 --> 00:38:17,587
Has anyone been here?

386
00:38:18,631 --> 00:38:19,924
I don't know.

387
00:38:20,466 --> 00:38:22,635
I seemed to hear footsteps.

388
00:38:22,927 --> 00:38:25,846
- I thought it was you two. - We went out a moment ago.

389
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:27,698
It's not possible that someone came in.

390
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,984
- Brother, I'll help you dress the wound. - Never mind.

391
00:38:38,276 --> 00:38:40,956
You take care of Mistress. I'll rub some medicine and it'll be okay.

392
00:39:04,969 --> 00:39:05,969
What's your name?

393
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:10,933
The most senior student of Patience Clan, Fong-gong.

394
00:39:11,475 --> 00:39:13,811
It's very late at night, what are you doing here?

395
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:17,189
I came to ask you, what does my master owe you?

396
00:39:18,858 --> 00:39:21,277
Three years ago, didn't you personally see it?

397
00:39:23,321 --> 00:39:26,157
Then blame the poor skill of Tong Saan Martial arts.

398
00:39:27,616 --> 00:39:30,161
That's why I'm here, to seek justice for my master's school.

399
00:39:30,453 --> 00:39:31,704
What do you consider justice?

400
00:39:32,163 --> 00:39:34,623
Using my Tong Saan Fist against your Tam’s Kick.

401
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:36,500
What if you lose?

402
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:38,419
Do as you please.

403
00:39:38,836 --> 00:39:39,837
What if I win?

404
00:39:40,713 --> 00:39:43,132
- What do you want? - Go and ask your master!

405
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:46,427
Before asking my master, you must ask me first.

406
00:39:46,969 --> 00:39:49,221
You want to fight? Let's go outside.

407
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:07,341
Does this count as having asked?

408
00:41:41,876 --> 00:41:44,044
Well? No match for him?

409
00:41:46,672 --> 00:41:48,507
Master, how did you know?

410
00:41:50,468 --> 00:41:52,720
What can you hide from me?

411
00:41:54,305 --> 00:41:55,723
Why didn't you listen to my words?

412
00:41:59,602 --> 00:42:02,480
Master, you used martial arts to defeat Chong Saam-taai.

413
00:42:02,771 --> 00:42:04,051
What's more, we didn't do wrong.

414
00:42:04,231 --> 00:42:06,775
Why do you always yield to them?

415
00:42:07,067 --> 00:42:08,986
Are you so afraid of them?

416
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:13,616
You don't understand, I'm indebted to them.

417
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:15,326
Even if you owe them,

418
00:42:15,618 --> 00:42:17,698
a student is obliged to help his master repay a debt.

419
00:42:20,289 --> 00:42:22,625
Have you not just had enough of a beating?

420
00:42:24,251 --> 00:42:27,338
That's why I'd like to ask Master to teach me the supreme Tam’s Kick.

421
00:42:27,796 --> 00:42:29,173
Your student must fight him again.

422
00:42:30,341 --> 00:42:33,052
Why do you always ask me to teach you Tam's Kick?

423
00:42:36,263 --> 00:42:40,059
Tong Huo-wan wouldn't be here unless he is fully prepared.

424
00:42:40,768 --> 00:42:44,438
Even my Tan’s Kick might not defeat him for sure.

425
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:52,530
Why can't I match up to him?

426
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:58,452
There's no need to take these personal grievances seriously.

427
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:00,239
The most important thing now

428
00:43:00,287 --> 00:43:02,540
must be searching for evidence of the Ngais crimes here.

429
00:43:02,831 --> 00:43:04,750
I want to find Fatty Heoi.

430
00:43:05,292 --> 00:43:10,172
If you intend to help Master with things, go and find Fatty Heoi.

431
00:43:11,966 --> 00:43:12,966
Can you do it?

432
00:43:13,968 --> 00:43:16,345
I can do it. I'll definitely find him.

433
00:43:24,478 --> 00:43:26,355
- Why is there no one here? - Don't worry.

434
00:43:26,647 --> 00:43:28,357
Even if there's an ambush, I'm not afraid.

435
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:50,713
I, Tong Huo-wan, have arrived.

436
00:43:59,597 --> 00:44:00,639
This way, please.

437
00:44:34,173 --> 00:44:35,173
This way, please.

438
00:44:45,434 --> 00:44:46,434
Over there.

439
00:44:55,361 --> 00:44:58,447
- Dad, they've arrived. - Ask them to come in.

440
00:45:01,075 --> 00:45:02,075
Please go in.

441
00:45:07,581 --> 00:45:08,581
Please come in.

442
00:45:21,053 --> 00:45:22,596
Cau-ping, you go out.

443
00:45:29,144 --> 00:45:30,144
Dad.

444
00:45:30,646 --> 00:45:32,690
- Go out. - Yes.

445
00:45:35,859 --> 00:45:36,859
Close the door.

446
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:44,493
Chung Gim-gwan, you've brought us along here.

447
00:45:44,785 --> 00:45:46,704
It doesn't seem like an ideal Place.

448
00:45:47,413 --> 00:45:50,916
This is the suitable Place to settle grievances.

449
00:45:51,542 --> 00:45:54,586
Today is the third anniversary of my wife's death.

450
00:45:55,379 --> 00:45:58,424
As far as I'm concerned, this is an important day for me.

451
00:46:00,801 --> 00:46:06,724
I believe we should do it in front of my late wife's shrine;

452
00:46:07,015 --> 00:46:09,059
it is the most appropriate Place.

453
00:46:09,685 --> 00:46:10,936
What do you all think?

454
00:46:11,895 --> 00:46:14,356
We all have grievances. We'll settle them now.

455
00:46:14,648 --> 00:46:17,109
Firstly, you restore this.

456
00:46:20,195 --> 00:46:24,283
The board is already broken, how can I restore it?

457
00:46:33,751 --> 00:46:35,711
TONG SAAN MARTIAL ARTS SCHOOL

458
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:43,427
Please, all three of you,

459
00:46:44,094 --> 00:46:45,763
open that chest there and have a look.

460
00:47:02,863 --> 00:47:08,202
I did this to alleviate my guilt.

461
00:47:11,622 --> 00:47:13,832
Then, that leg...

462
00:47:19,838 --> 00:47:23,258
I was impetuous then, made a big mistake.

463
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:26,220
Full of guilt.

464
00:47:28,222 --> 00:47:31,558
I actually have peace of mind seeing you today.

465
00:47:34,019 --> 00:47:36,539
You believe you can use your injury to inspire sympathy from us?

466
00:47:38,315 --> 00:47:43,153
Could it be that my offer of a gold board and my severed leg

467
00:47:43,904 --> 00:47:46,490
falls short for a person's apology?

468
00:47:52,079 --> 00:47:56,834
I've changed the name from champion to Patience.

469
00:47:57,626 --> 00:47:59,586
All for today.

470
00:48:00,587 --> 00:48:02,673
How do you wish to deal with me?

471
00:48:03,465 --> 00:48:04,883
Please carry it out.

472
00:48:06,051 --> 00:48:07,052
Stop!

473
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:09,304
Chung Gim-gwan,

474
00:48:10,138 --> 00:48:12,099
our grievance...

475
00:48:13,100 --> 00:48:14,852
- is finished. - Finished?!

476
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:17,479
Mistress, we came from such a far Place.

477
00:48:17,771 --> 00:48:19,356
- I... - Don't say anything!

478
00:48:26,947 --> 00:48:28,073
Brother,

479
00:48:28,699 --> 00:48:31,326
I want revenge from my father's killer too.

480
00:48:32,619 --> 00:48:33,787
But,

481
00:48:34,788 --> 00:48:37,791
how can you take advantage of a handicapped person that cannot retaliate?

482
00:48:52,306 --> 00:48:53,599
Not fair.

483
00:48:54,892 --> 00:48:56,101
Not fair.

484
00:48:57,477 --> 00:49:01,189
- Is this news reliable? - It was Saam who personally informed me.

485
00:49:01,857 --> 00:49:02,900
Now that it's finished,

486
00:49:03,191 --> 00:49:05,569
will the Tong family be returning to Tong Saan?

487
00:49:06,278 --> 00:49:09,114
Rest assured, he won't leave.

488
00:49:09,573 --> 00:49:10,573
Why?

489
00:49:11,366 --> 00:49:12,492
Oh, yes, Big Brother,

490
00:49:12,784 --> 00:49:17,706
I've already arranged an excellent plan for you.

491
00:49:17,998 --> 00:49:20,125
Don't be confusing. What the hell are you doing?

492
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:23,170
My strategy is to have someone else do the dirty work.

493
00:49:23,462 --> 00:49:27,883
Tong is like Chiu Wan, the late general.

494
00:49:28,425 --> 00:49:32,638
This valiant will soon be working for us.

495
00:49:43,273 --> 00:49:44,483
Doctor,

496
00:49:44,775 --> 00:49:45,943
is she getting better?

497
00:49:48,654 --> 00:49:50,822
I don't think I need to prescribe medicine.

498
00:49:51,406 --> 00:49:52,824
What? She can't be treated?

499
00:49:53,492 --> 00:49:54,826
She has a strange illness.

500
00:49:55,118 --> 00:49:58,121
What can I prescribe? What she's taking has no effect.

501
00:49:58,956 --> 00:50:01,875
Doctor, prescribe us another dose anyway.

502
00:50:02,292 --> 00:50:04,544
I've already said that prescribing medicine is no use.

503
00:50:04,836 --> 00:50:07,798
Unless you go to the Ngais to ask for their secret family recipe.

504
00:50:08,131 --> 00:50:09,341
That would be useful.

505
00:50:09,883 --> 00:50:12,010
Doctor, I beg for your help.

506
00:50:12,302 --> 00:50:13,902
We're willing to pay any amount of money.

507
00:50:14,763 --> 00:50:17,099
They are hugely wealthy and don't care about money.

508
00:50:17,391 --> 00:50:18,511
Then you take me to beg him,

509
00:50:18,684 --> 00:50:20,370
if only for the medicine to cure Mistress's illness.

510
00:50:20,394 --> 00:50:21,979
I can work very hard.

511
00:50:22,270 --> 00:50:25,607
All right. I'll take you to try.

512
00:50:34,574 --> 00:50:36,660
Master Tong, what brings you here?

513
00:50:37,411 --> 00:50:39,830
Please pass on a message, I would like to see Mr Ngai.

514
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:42,874
There's no need to pass it on. Come, please come in.

515
00:51:33,216 --> 00:51:35,302
Lord Ngai, Master Tong is here to see you.

516
00:51:37,471 --> 00:51:40,182
What brings you here? Come, please sit down.

517
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:46,539
- Sit down. - Thank you, Lord, for the medicine.

518
00:51:46,563 --> 00:51:47,999
This is a small token of my appreciation.

519
00:51:48,023 --> 00:51:50,150
So polite. Here.

520
00:51:50,442 --> 00:51:51,526
Sit down.

521
00:51:55,155 --> 00:51:57,315
- Well? Was the medicine effective? - It was effective.

522
00:51:57,491 --> 00:51:58,891
The chest pain was instantly cured.

523
00:51:59,326 --> 00:52:00,326
That's good then.

524
00:52:00,368 --> 00:52:03,455
This medicine is a secret family recipe. I seldom give it to people.

525
00:52:03,997 --> 00:52:05,082
I know.

526
00:52:05,624 --> 00:52:07,959
I'm here now to ask Lord to give me a little more.

527
00:52:08,627 --> 00:52:10,467
Of course, I don't dare ask to buy it from you.

528
00:52:10,921 --> 00:52:13,799
I'd like to ask, if you care, to state a price...

529
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:17,094
It's not a question of money but there's only a little left.

530
00:52:17,385 --> 00:52:18,988
I'm afraid that, if you return to Tong Saan,

531
00:52:19,012 --> 00:52:20,332
what if the illness flares again?

532
00:52:22,057 --> 00:52:23,600
Well, you're right.

533
00:52:23,975 --> 00:52:25,477
We have such a far journey.

534
00:52:25,894 --> 00:52:28,146
I can't gift the secret recipe, of course.

535
00:52:32,943 --> 00:52:34,629
I'd like to propose something for the two of us.

536
00:52:34,653 --> 00:52:36,133
You can stay here for the time being.

537
00:52:36,363 --> 00:52:38,240
I'll be responsible for your upkeep.

538
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:41,034
Do you think this is okay?

539
00:52:42,119 --> 00:52:43,829
I know that your martial arts are good.

540
00:52:44,121 --> 00:52:46,706
We've recently had a shortage of manpower here.

541
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:51,270
You should realise that our Big Brother has always had a fondness for ability.

542
00:52:51,294 --> 00:52:52,504
He wants to promote you.

543
00:52:52,796 --> 00:52:54,297
We must hurry back to Tong Saan.

544
00:52:54,589 --> 00:52:55,949
My mistress wishes to return home.

545
00:52:56,007 --> 00:52:57,425
How can you go if she's ill?

546
00:52:57,968 --> 00:52:59,288
You make yourselves at home here.

547
00:52:59,344 --> 00:53:01,144
Wait until your mistress is well enough to go.

548
00:53:01,263 --> 00:53:02,889
And I won't keep you.

549
00:53:03,265 --> 00:53:03,807
That's right.

550
00:53:04,099 --> 00:53:07,477
It's our Big Brother's good intention and to be friends with you.

551
00:53:07,769 --> 00:53:09,479
So what do you want me to do?

552
00:53:09,938 --> 00:53:11,148
Deal with the Patience Clan.

553
00:53:11,439 --> 00:53:14,192
They've many people with good martial arts and bully us all day long.

554
00:53:14,484 --> 00:53:16,528
My hope is that you can later uphold justice.

555
00:53:17,445 --> 00:53:20,407
Also, I heard that you saw old man Chung handicapped

556
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:22,051
and didn't have the heart to hit him.

557
00:53:22,075 --> 00:53:24,786
In actual fact, he didn't sever his leg for you.

558
00:53:25,078 --> 00:53:26,538
He knew he wouldn't be your match.

559
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:28,790
It was a special act...

560
00:53:29,583 --> 00:53:31,018
so that you couldn't bear to hit him.

561
00:53:31,042 --> 00:53:32,627
You fell for his plan.

562
00:53:34,296 --> 00:53:35,755
This is the little medicine I have.

563
00:53:36,131 --> 00:53:37,131
You take this first.

564
00:53:37,340 --> 00:53:39,342
I'll promptly ask my man to make more for you.

565
00:54:28,767 --> 00:54:29,767
Don't hit him!

566
00:54:31,269 --> 00:54:34,314
I'll give face to Master Tong, merely breaking one leg!

567
00:54:35,357 --> 00:54:38,637
If the four brothers don't bring the lease of the tea garden to the Ngais tomorrow,

568
00:54:39,611 --> 00:54:40,611
I'll kill you!

569
00:54:40,820 --> 00:54:41,820
Hear that?

570
00:54:42,155 --> 00:54:43,531
Master Tong, Please.

571
00:55:23,655 --> 00:55:25,365
You have three days to leave here.

572
00:55:25,991 --> 00:55:27,284
You're all outlaws.

573
00:55:27,575 --> 00:55:29,619
I'll get Master Chung to come and deal with you.

574
00:55:30,412 --> 00:55:31,972
This is exactly where we want you to go.

575
00:55:43,675 --> 00:55:45,552
Huo-wan! Don't move.

576
00:55:48,555 --> 00:55:50,056
I've been waiting for you.

577
00:55:51,474 --> 00:55:52,684
What is it?

578
00:55:54,185 --> 00:55:57,647
I really can't believe you're working for the Ngais.

579
00:55:58,231 --> 00:56:00,317
I really am working for the Ngais.

580
00:56:01,067 --> 00:56:02,402
You mustn't continue doing it.

581
00:56:02,819 --> 00:56:03,819
I must.

582
00:56:04,029 --> 00:56:07,907
If you want to know about Ngai Cong-long, I'll tell you.

583
00:56:09,117 --> 00:56:10,117
No need.

584
00:56:10,827 --> 00:56:13,371
He is particularly opposed to our Patience Clan.

585
00:56:14,247 --> 00:56:15,623
I have no choice.

586
00:56:18,626 --> 00:56:19,878
It's best...

587
00:56:20,754 --> 00:56:22,255
you don't provoke him in the future.

588
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:24,380
I really don't understand.

589
00:56:24,549 --> 00:56:26,843
What hatred is still left between us?

590
00:56:30,347 --> 00:56:31,765
You really want to know?

591
00:56:32,474 --> 00:56:33,474
Of course.

592
00:56:34,017 --> 00:56:35,226
It's simple.

593
00:56:35,518 --> 00:56:37,062
My master is dead;

594
00:56:37,354 --> 00:56:38,396
your dad,

595
00:56:39,064 --> 00:56:40,690
though he severed a leg,

596
00:56:41,399 --> 00:56:42,399
is still alive.

597
00:56:43,943 --> 00:56:44,943
Do you understand?

598
00:56:45,362 --> 00:56:47,238
No wonder you haven't returned to Tong Saan.

599
00:56:47,906 --> 00:56:49,949
No wonder you're working for the Ngais.

600
00:56:50,784 --> 00:56:53,828
My dad constantly tells us not to hate you.

601
00:56:54,788 --> 00:56:57,624
I also thought you were an honorable man.

602
00:56:58,249 --> 00:56:58,958
I couldn't have imagined...

603
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:00,335
Hate you, I hate you!

604
00:57:36,037 --> 00:57:37,831
- It's you. - I'll kill you.

605
00:57:49,926 --> 00:57:51,219
Stop!

606
00:57:56,099 --> 00:57:58,560
Don't fight anymore'.

607
00:57:59,894 --> 00:58:01,396
Stop!

608
00:58:01,771 --> 00:58:03,064
Both of you, stop fighting!

609
00:58:09,696 --> 00:58:11,030
Won't you go quickly.

610
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:25,670
Why didn't you let me fight him?

611
00:58:25,962 --> 00:58:27,422
Why?

612
00:58:32,218 --> 00:58:33,970
- Mistress, your favourite food. - Okay.

613
00:58:34,262 --> 00:58:35,722
I bought this fabric for you.

614
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:38,492
The color is very beautiful.

615
00:58:38,516 --> 00:58:40,310
- It's good. - Mistress, your medicine.

616
00:58:41,060 --> 00:58:43,688
I just happened to finish these last night.

617
00:58:43,980 --> 00:58:45,857
Finished? I got I00 last time.

618
00:58:46,149 --> 00:58:47,589
How could they be finished so quick?

619
00:58:48,151 --> 00:58:50,278
Before, I had three Pills every time to ease the Pain.

620
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:52,780
Now, having six pills cannot stop the Pain.

621
00:58:53,072 --> 00:58:54,782
Mum, why didn't you tell me?

622
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:58,578
Because of my illness, you're both already very troubled.

623
00:58:58,870 --> 00:58:59,996
Why bother telling you?

624
00:59:00,288 --> 00:59:03,750
No harm in taking more if it eases the pain.

625
00:59:05,752 --> 00:59:07,295
Having more...

626
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,632
is not the solution.

627
00:59:11,382 --> 00:59:14,093
Huo-wan, Lord Ngai is really a nice man.

628
00:59:14,636 --> 00:59:17,805
But it's not very good for us to always inconvenience others.

629
00:59:18,181 --> 00:59:21,392
Better still, go and ask him to provide the prescription for us.

630
00:59:21,684 --> 00:59:23,394
We can return and make more ourselves.

631
00:59:24,562 --> 00:59:27,041
I asked him every time for the prescription; he wasn't willing to give it to me.

632
00:59:27,065 --> 00:59:28,608
I don't know at all why.

633
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:30,318
What should we do, then?

634
00:59:30,610 --> 00:59:31,903
Because of my illness,

635
00:59:32,195 --> 00:59:34,447
I don't know when we'll be able to return to Tong Saan.

636
00:59:34,739 --> 00:59:36,032
Mistress, rest assured,

637
00:59:36,324 --> 00:59:39,077
I'm working for them, they'll surely provide me the medicine.

638
00:59:39,369 --> 00:59:41,729
I'll definitely think of a quick way to return to Tong Saan.

639
00:59:43,039 --> 00:59:44,832
- I'll go back to my room first. - Okay.

640
00:59:49,546 --> 00:59:50,546
Tong Huo-wan!

641
00:59:54,968 --> 00:59:56,844
You don't need to shout. What is it?

642
00:59:57,136 --> 00:59:58,471
Big Brother wants you.

643
00:59:58,763 --> 00:59:59,763
It's late.

644
01:00:00,014 --> 01:00:01,724
It's an important matter, of course.

645
01:00:02,475 --> 01:00:04,852
- Well... - Let's go. Still talking?

646
01:00:05,812 --> 01:00:07,772
Mum, have you noticed...

647
01:00:08,606 --> 01:00:11,150
brother seems to have something on his mind?

648
01:00:12,277 --> 01:00:15,071
Ever since your father died, I've appreciated him.

649
01:00:15,363 --> 01:00:19,909
Even my own son wouldn't treat me this well.

650
01:00:26,249 --> 01:00:27,249
What is it?

651
01:00:33,715 --> 01:00:35,216
Brother, where are you going?

652
01:00:35,717 --> 01:00:37,510
You go back to sleep. I'll be back soon.

653
01:00:45,643 --> 01:00:47,563
I found out today's smuggling Place of the Ngais.

654
01:00:47,854 --> 01:00:48,854
Let's get him.

655
01:00:49,606 --> 01:00:50,982
Then let's inform Master quickly.

656
01:00:51,274 --> 01:00:51,941
No need.

657
01:00:52,233 --> 01:00:54,235
If we inform Master, he'll ask us to be patient.

658
01:00:54,527 --> 01:00:55,927
He won't allow it. Let's go firstly.

659
01:00:56,112 --> 01:00:57,112
Let's go.

660
01:01:14,589 --> 01:01:16,049
It's right ahead. Be careful.

661
01:02:05,556 --> 01:02:06,556
Quicker!

662
01:02:15,024 --> 01:02:16,484
- Quicker! - Hold it!

663
01:02:19,946 --> 01:02:21,155
What are you doing?

664
01:02:21,447 --> 01:02:22,907
You've been caught in the act now.

665
01:02:24,242 --> 01:02:26,577
I, Young Master, do what I want. None of your business!

666
01:02:26,869 --> 01:02:27,954
- Get them! - Yes!

667
01:03:20,298 --> 01:03:21,758
- Let's go! - Let's go.

668
01:03:27,221 --> 01:03:28,347
Split up.

669
01:03:33,603 --> 01:03:34,729
Chase them!

670
01:03:39,901 --> 01:03:41,652
It's so late, what is it?

671
01:03:42,069 --> 01:03:43,672
There is a batch of goods being traded here tonight.

672
01:03:43,696 --> 01:03:46,096
Big Brother is worried about mishaps, you're here to oversee.

673
01:03:49,869 --> 01:03:52,246
Why is the kid sleeping there at this time of the day?

674
01:03:54,165 --> 01:03:55,500
Come on, over there.

675
01:03:58,002 --> 01:03:59,921
Little Hei!

676
01:04:02,381 --> 01:04:03,549
Little Hei.

677
01:04:05,051 --> 01:04:06,051
Tong Huo-wan!

678
01:04:06,302 --> 01:04:08,471
You're just cruel, you're an animal.

679
01:04:08,763 --> 01:04:10,603
What do you have against the Patience Clan now?

680
01:04:10,973 --> 01:04:12,308
Why couldn't you spare a child?

681
01:04:12,809 --> 01:04:13,851
I...

682
01:04:18,564 --> 01:04:20,441
- Listen to me. - What's there to listen to?

683
01:04:30,034 --> 01:04:31,869
To hell with your attitude.

684
01:04:32,537 --> 01:04:33,955
- Come out! - Yes!

685
01:04:40,169 --> 01:04:43,256
Gentlemen, how do you like the grave I've found for you?

686
01:04:44,715 --> 01:04:45,715
Tong Huo-wan,

687
01:04:45,883 --> 01:04:48,344
Big Brother called you here to take care of this matter.

688
01:04:48,636 --> 01:04:49,636
Kill them both.

689
01:04:49,887 --> 01:04:51,472
- I won't do it. - Why?

690
01:04:51,764 --> 01:04:53,975
I, Tong Huo-wan, have always been honest and upright.

691
01:04:54,267 --> 01:04:55,351
You won't do it?

692
01:04:55,643 --> 01:04:56,643
Really?

693
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:58,760
Come. I order you to kill them!

694
01:04:59,021 --> 01:05:00,147
- Yes! - Don't move!

695
01:05:02,567 --> 01:05:03,860
Let them go.

696
01:05:05,695 --> 01:05:07,615
It was hard for us to lure them into such a trap.

697
01:05:07,738 --> 01:05:09,538
If you let them go, Big Brother will be angry.

698
01:05:09,824 --> 01:05:12,010
- Who'll take responsibility? - I'll take responsibility.

699
01:05:12,034 --> 01:05:14,078
If there's anyone not scared to die, carry on!

700
01:05:15,454 --> 01:05:16,455
You...

701
01:05:16,747 --> 01:05:17,957
Gentlemen, please.

702
01:05:18,291 --> 01:05:19,333
Hey...

703
01:05:55,369 --> 01:05:56,746
Sister, I'm convinced.

704
01:05:58,164 --> 01:05:59,373
Sorry, Brother.

705
01:05:59,957 --> 01:06:01,751
- Are you injured? - No.

706
01:06:11,093 --> 01:06:12,219
Little Hei...

707
01:06:12,637 --> 01:06:14,639
Why did he end up like this? Who did it?

708
01:06:15,222 --> 01:06:16,222
Tell me.

709
01:06:23,481 --> 01:06:24,982
Who killed him?

710
01:06:25,566 --> 01:06:27,526
Tell me. Why won't you tell me?

711
01:06:34,992 --> 01:06:37,703
I saw Tong present.

712
01:06:37,995 --> 01:06:40,456
I want revenge, but I can't defeat him'.

713
01:06:41,916 --> 01:06:44,919
- I'm so useless. - I don't believe it.

714
01:06:47,922 --> 01:06:49,423
Did he really kill him?

715
01:06:50,091 --> 01:06:51,842
He was the killer.

716
01:07:03,729 --> 01:07:04,897
Dad.

717
01:07:53,738 --> 01:07:54,739
What do you both want?

718
01:08:12,381 --> 01:08:14,633
Talk! Where is Fatty Heoi?

719
01:08:17,511 --> 01:08:18,512
I'll talk.

720
01:08:25,394 --> 01:08:27,104
- Listen to me, brother. - What is it?

721
01:08:30,483 --> 01:08:33,486
Let me tell you something. I got to know a beautiful girl last night.

722
01:08:33,778 --> 01:08:34,945
She was fabulous!

723
01:08:35,237 --> 01:08:38,949
While we were haggling over the price, I touched her and she was ecstatic.

724
01:09:48,394 --> 01:09:49,520
Stop!

725
01:09:49,812 --> 01:09:50,813
Don't hit him again.

726
01:09:51,105 --> 01:09:52,523
We need him alive.

727
01:09:57,194 --> 01:09:59,738
Ngai.' Tell your Big Brother,

728
01:10:00,030 --> 01:10:03,159
we're returning to ask questions, then back here to deal with you.

729
01:10:03,450 --> 01:10:04,451
Move.

730
01:10:07,663 --> 01:10:08,663
Very good.

731
01:10:08,914 --> 01:10:10,958
Now is the time to get even.

732
01:10:11,667 --> 01:10:15,379
I always told everyone to have Patience but now it's gone beyond that.

733
01:10:16,255 --> 01:10:17,975
Now that Fatty Heoi has revealed everything,

734
01:10:18,215 --> 01:10:20,259
the Ngais are true outlaws.

735
01:10:20,718 --> 01:10:22,428
I'm going to hold him to account tonight.

736
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:23,721
- Fong-gong. - Master.

737
01:10:24,013 --> 01:10:25,431
- Bring Fatty Heoi here. - Yes.

738
01:10:28,017 --> 01:10:29,935
Cau-ping, get my crutch.

739
01:10:30,394 --> 01:10:33,606
- Dad, what will you do? - I want to visit Ngai Cong-long.

740
01:10:33,939 --> 01:10:34,939
No!

741
01:10:35,191 --> 01:10:37,359
If it gets physical, what then?

742
01:10:37,651 --> 01:10:39,904
I still have one leg. Go.

743
01:10:40,988 --> 01:10:41,989
All right.

744
01:10:49,371 --> 01:10:52,291
Hey, Fatty Heoi, get up. We're sending you back.

745
01:10:55,461 --> 01:10:57,838
Well? Are you just going to stay there?

746
01:11:08,515 --> 01:11:11,560
Master, it's bad! Fatty Heoi has been murdered!

747
01:11:13,187 --> 01:11:14,187
Who killed him?

748
01:11:14,396 --> 01:11:16,516
Now we've lost our main witness, what shall we do now?

749
01:11:18,025 --> 01:11:20,444
All of you speak, who killed him?

750
01:11:22,738 --> 01:11:24,657
Master, what do you say we do?

751
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:28,244
We can't hold the Ngais to account at this time, again.

752
01:11:29,703 --> 01:11:31,497
Aside from that,

753
01:11:32,623 --> 01:11:34,333
the Ngais' man died in my place.

754
01:11:34,625 --> 01:11:36,545
They absolutely won't be willing to give this up.

755
01:11:37,419 --> 01:11:39,880
I see a lot of trouble.

756
01:11:40,547 --> 01:11:42,174
Fatty Heoi is dead? Says who?

757
01:11:42,466 --> 01:11:44,134
It was Saam who personally saw it.

758
01:11:45,803 --> 01:11:48,889
They captured my man and, furthermore, killed him.

759
01:11:51,016 --> 01:11:52,016
Huo-wan,

760
01:11:52,184 --> 01:11:54,395
what do you think? Haven't they gone too far?

761
01:11:54,687 --> 01:11:57,356
Don't get angry too soon. Ask again before taking action.

762
01:11:57,940 --> 01:11:59,460
There's no second road to go down now.

763
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:02,736
Huo-wan, I want them to hand over Fatty Heoi.

764
01:12:03,028 --> 01:12:06,865
After calling for this, you take down the Patience Clan place.

765
01:12:09,201 --> 01:12:10,869
This is something I absolutely won't do.

766
01:12:11,370 --> 01:12:12,454
You won't do it?

767
01:12:12,746 --> 01:12:15,916
They believe that you killed Little Hei. You will be hunted down somehow.

768
01:12:17,126 --> 01:12:18,561
This is something you do understand.

769
01:12:18,585 --> 01:12:20,212
It wasn't me who killed Little Hei.

770
01:12:21,005 --> 01:12:22,756
You can explain to them for me.

771
01:12:23,674 --> 01:12:26,760
Why would they believe your words?

772
01:12:28,053 --> 01:12:30,055
It's not important to me if they believe it or not,

773
01:12:30,347 --> 01:12:32,558
I won't do this task.

774
01:12:33,142 --> 01:12:34,142
You think about it.

775
01:12:34,226 --> 01:12:36,145
You were originally here to avenge your master.

776
01:12:36,437 --> 01:12:37,677
This would be right and Proper.

777
01:12:37,896 --> 01:12:40,256
No one in the martial arts society would say you were wrong.

778
01:12:41,567 --> 01:12:42,151
Huo-wan,

779
01:12:42,443 --> 01:12:44,278
I, Ngai Cong-long, cannot stand this.

780
01:12:44,570 --> 01:12:47,450
As long as you settle this matter for me, I'll give you the prescription.

781
01:12:47,531 --> 01:12:49,131
You can return to Tong Saan at any time.

782
01:12:49,491 --> 01:12:50,826
What if Fatty Heoi hasn't died?

783
01:12:51,660 --> 01:12:53,740
Then that's the best outcome. Everyone will be happy.

784
01:12:53,912 --> 01:12:55,956
I will still give you the prescription.

785
01:13:09,887 --> 01:13:11,847
- What is it? - What room is Miss Chong in?

786
01:13:12,139 --> 01:13:13,724
- It's that room. - Thanks.

787
01:13:25,778 --> 01:13:28,155
I have something I wish to discuss with you, okay?

788
01:13:35,162 --> 01:13:36,162
Madam Chong.

789
01:13:36,246 --> 01:13:38,624
It's you. Is there something wrong?

790
01:13:39,208 --> 01:13:40,959
If there is something, say it now.

791
01:13:41,251 --> 01:13:44,421
Miss Chong, I really have come in good faith to find you.

792
01:13:44,963 --> 01:13:46,340
Who would believe you?

793
01:13:46,924 --> 01:13:48,634
How can you speak to someone like this?

794
01:13:48,926 --> 01:13:50,052
Please sit down.

795
01:13:57,142 --> 01:13:58,894
- Drink some tea. - Thanks.

796
01:14:00,979 --> 01:14:06,151
Do you both know what Tong Huo-wan is doing at the moment?

797
01:14:06,443 --> 01:14:09,196
We know. He's working for Lord Ngai.

798
01:14:09,863 --> 01:14:12,282
That's right, but he is committing misdeeds.

799
01:14:13,826 --> 01:14:14,910
Misdeeds?

800
01:14:15,369 --> 01:14:17,830
Don't you talk nonsense, my brother isn't that kind of man.

801
01:14:18,497 --> 01:14:20,833
The four Ngai brothers are evil tyrants here.

802
01:14:21,125 --> 01:14:23,544
He is their accomplice, in praying on people.

803
01:14:24,795 --> 01:14:26,004
I really feel sorry for him.

804
01:14:27,172 --> 01:14:28,882
We weren't at all aware.

805
01:14:29,383 --> 01:14:32,136
- Mung-Iaan, I don't think it's likely. - It isn't.

806
01:14:33,011 --> 01:14:35,772
Even if my brother has committed misdeeds, it's none of your business.

807
01:14:36,056 --> 01:14:37,616
For what reason did you want to tell us?

808
01:14:39,184 --> 01:14:41,520
I know that you aren't aware.

809
01:14:42,271 --> 01:14:45,441
I'm especially here to warn you, go back to Tong SAAN early.

810
01:14:47,276 --> 01:14:49,676
Why should we answer to you if we're going back to Tong Saan?

811
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:53,157
The Ngais are vicious and merciless. Tong Huo-wan is a good man.

812
01:14:53,449 --> 01:14:56,326
He's no match for the Ngais, no point in sacrificing his life.

813
01:15:04,626 --> 01:15:05,627
See you.

814
01:15:17,973 --> 01:15:19,016
Miss Chung,

815
01:15:20,642 --> 01:15:22,269
I have something I want to say to you.

816
01:15:22,561 --> 01:15:23,561
What is it?

817
01:15:23,687 --> 01:15:25,527
I had nothing to do with your brother's murder.

818
01:15:58,889 --> 01:16:01,433
Why do you do such things? Aren't you ashamed?

819
01:16:03,018 --> 01:16:05,498
You have been committing misdeeds out there. I know everything.

820
01:16:05,562 --> 01:16:06,688
I'm going to tell Mum.

821
01:16:06,980 --> 01:16:07,981
Sister.

822
01:16:08,273 --> 01:16:09,358
Let go of your hand.

823
01:16:09,775 --> 01:16:11,818
I beg you, don't tell Mistress.

824
01:16:12,277 --> 01:16:13,277
I must.

825
01:16:13,862 --> 01:16:14,862
Sister.

826
01:16:16,490 --> 01:16:18,909
Why have you committed such dishonorable acts?

827
01:16:19,201 --> 01:16:20,327
What for?

828
01:16:20,619 --> 01:16:21,870
What for?!

829
01:16:26,083 --> 01:16:27,209
For Mistress.

830
01:16:30,045 --> 01:16:32,881
I needed the Pills for Mistress's illness.

831
01:16:33,966 --> 01:16:38,428
So long as Mistress can enjoy life, without suffering any more pain,

832
01:16:39,471 --> 01:16:41,139
I'm willing to do anything,

833
01:16:41,890 --> 01:16:44,017
even if it's heartless and unjust.

834
01:16:45,018 --> 01:16:47,354
Since I was young, I had no father or mother.

835
01:16:47,771 --> 01:16:49,940
I've been fostered all my life by Mistress;

836
01:16:50,315 --> 01:16:52,484
Master brought me up.

837
01:16:53,026 --> 01:16:57,447
I cannot repay Master, but I must repay Mistress, wholeheartedly.

838
01:16:58,115 --> 01:16:59,283
Mung-Iaan,

839
01:16:59,575 --> 01:17:01,326
Mistress is of great age,

840
01:17:01,618 --> 01:17:03,578
there aren't many days left to repay her kindness.

841
01:17:03,787 --> 01:17:04,787
Brother...

842
01:17:06,373 --> 01:17:08,125
I must be a filial son.

843
01:17:09,084 --> 01:17:10,210
Believe me.

844
01:17:10,502 --> 01:17:13,422
I have no alternative but to work for the Ngais on one final task.

845
01:17:14,464 --> 01:17:17,050
Helping them do what? Commit atrocious acts?

846
01:17:18,802 --> 01:17:21,555
Don't ask so much. I know what I'm doing.

847
01:17:22,014 --> 01:17:24,600
After tomorrow, we'll return to Tong Saan straightaway.

848
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:42,451
Hey! They're coming. Close the doors!

849
01:17:45,996 --> 01:17:47,205
Open the doors.

850
01:17:48,165 --> 01:17:49,165
Open the doors.

851
01:17:55,631 --> 01:17:58,550
Keep the doors open. Our Patience Clan isn't afraid to die.

852
01:17:58,842 --> 01:18:00,862
- Correct! We aren't afraid to die! - Yes'. We aren't afraid to die!

853
01:18:00,886 --> 01:18:04,306
The Ngais dare to confront us here. Truly arrogant.'

854
01:18:06,975 --> 01:18:07,975
Dad,

855
01:18:08,185 --> 01:18:10,854
talking reasonably with them won't work, let's fight them.

856
01:18:12,272 --> 01:18:13,982
Master, they're coming.

857
01:18:16,568 --> 01:18:17,736
Hey, let's go.

858
01:18:25,952 --> 01:18:27,329
You guard the outside doors.

859
01:18:27,621 --> 01:18:29,039
Don't allow anyone to leave.

860
01:18:29,373 --> 01:18:31,625
- If anyone appears, kill them. - Yes.

861
01:18:31,917 --> 01:18:32,959
Everyone disperse.

862
01:18:45,889 --> 01:18:48,475
Ngai Cong-long, you've brought many people here.

863
01:18:48,767 --> 01:18:49,935
What do you actually want?

864
01:18:51,269 --> 01:18:55,190
Chung Gim-gwan, didn't you tell my brother that you wanted to hold me to account?

865
01:18:56,108 --> 01:18:57,484
Here I am.

866
01:18:58,068 --> 01:18:59,653
You needn't be so pompous.

867
01:18:59,945 --> 01:19:02,447
You know your activities by heart.

868
01:19:03,198 --> 01:19:04,616
Of course.

869
01:19:04,908 --> 01:19:08,120
I kill people, commit arson and smuggle drugs.

870
01:19:08,870 --> 01:19:11,456
What can you do? Have you got any Proof?

871
01:19:17,170 --> 01:19:20,590
You're such an evil Person. There will be karma sooner or later.'

872
01:19:23,969 --> 01:19:26,722
It's now my turn to hold you to account.

873
01:19:27,055 --> 01:19:30,308
Did you capture Fatty Heoi and hold him here?

874
01:19:31,143 --> 01:19:32,936
- Don't know. - Don't know?

875
01:19:34,855 --> 01:19:36,940
You can't hand over my man?

876
01:19:37,691 --> 01:19:38,734
Tong Huo-wan,

877
01:19:39,276 --> 01:19:40,777
ask them to fetch him.

878
01:19:48,368 --> 01:19:50,287
Master Chung, I apologise first.

879
01:19:51,037 --> 01:19:53,999
Tong Huo-wan, I'm very disappointed in you.

880
01:19:54,916 --> 01:19:56,626
I thought you were a good man.

881
01:19:57,294 --> 01:19:59,654
How would it be known that you'd help a villain commit evil?

882
01:20:00,338 --> 01:20:02,924
I'm Paid for what I do.

883
01:20:03,383 --> 01:20:04,760
Please hand over the man.

884
01:20:05,969 --> 01:20:07,137
The man?

885
01:20:08,013 --> 01:20:10,849
I captured the man to here. I won't hand him over so easily.

886
01:20:11,433 --> 01:20:13,727
Both sides have sent men, each representing his own.

887
01:20:14,269 --> 01:20:17,314
If you don't hand the man over, I won't be civil.

888
01:20:34,498 --> 01:20:36,058
You really believe your martial arts are good?

889
01:20:36,082 --> 01:20:37,842
You think our Patience Clan is afraid of you?

890
01:20:38,543 --> 01:20:41,743
I don't intend to spoil our relationship, I merely want you to hand over the man.

891
01:20:42,172 --> 01:20:43,423
What if we don't hand him over?

892
01:20:43,715 --> 01:20:44,715
Are you out of your mind?

893
01:20:44,925 --> 01:20:46,319
You capture our man and won't let him go.

894
01:20:46,343 --> 01:20:47,552
Still so loud?

895
01:20:48,053 --> 01:20:49,221
If you don't let the man go,

896
01:20:49,513 --> 01:20:52,673
- then the Ngais aren't in the wrong... - Even if we are in the wrong, so be it.

897
01:21:19,292 --> 01:21:21,044
Lord, did you see that?

898
01:21:21,336 --> 01:21:23,056
It's as though Tong Huo-wan is holding back.

899
01:21:24,130 --> 01:21:26,550
I think we need to undertake the last step.

900
01:21:26,842 --> 01:21:27,843
All right.

901
01:21:55,537 --> 01:21:57,914
- Master. - Let Master lend his students a leg.

902
01:22:51,259 --> 01:22:52,260
- Go! - Yes!

903
01:23:10,987 --> 01:23:12,155
All of you go quickly!

904
01:23:34,886 --> 01:23:36,096
Let him try my Tam’s Kick.

905
01:23:55,991 --> 01:23:57,158
Huo-wan, you go.

906
01:24:23,268 --> 01:24:24,436
Not dead yet?

907
01:24:26,688 --> 01:24:28,356
Saam, quickly reveal your identify.

908
01:24:41,369 --> 01:24:43,204
- Master! - Dad!

909
01:24:59,262 --> 01:25:00,656
- Dad! - Master Chung, are you okay?

910
01:25:00,680 --> 01:25:02,223
- How injured are you? - Master!

911
01:25:02,766 --> 01:25:05,060
He... he plotted against me.

912
01:25:05,602 --> 01:25:08,104
I don't think you ever dreamt of it.

913
01:25:08,396 --> 01:25:11,316
So you're an insider for the Ngais?

914
01:25:12,942 --> 01:25:15,862
I've waited a couple of years for today.

915
01:25:17,113 --> 01:25:18,990
I always treated you kindly.

916
01:25:19,282 --> 01:25:21,201
You really are an animal.

917
01:25:22,035 --> 01:25:23,620
Your scolding me won't be any use.

918
01:25:23,912 --> 01:25:26,247
Blame yourself for being short-sighted.

919
01:25:26,790 --> 01:25:31,377
I merely have to kill you to repay Lord Ngai for saving my life.

920
01:25:31,961 --> 01:25:33,129
Let me be honest.

921
01:25:33,421 --> 01:25:36,716
I deliberately drew Little Hei out to be killed.

922
01:25:40,887 --> 01:25:42,597
So why did you impute me?

923
01:25:43,723 --> 01:25:45,600
I wanted to create misunderstandings among you

924
01:25:45,892 --> 01:25:47,310
and deepen your hatred.

925
01:25:47,602 --> 01:25:49,121
You wouldn't be able to Prove your innocence,

926
01:25:49,145 --> 01:25:51,022
and have to work for Lord Ngai.

927
01:25:51,439 --> 01:25:52,857
That's right.

928
01:25:53,233 --> 01:25:55,610
This was my excellent Plan.

929
01:25:55,902 --> 01:25:56,902
I'll tell you

930
01:25:57,070 --> 01:25:59,781
I ordered for Fatty Heoi's capture to back here,

931
01:26:00,073 --> 01:26:01,713
then his murder afterwards to silence him.

932
01:26:01,950 --> 01:26:04,744
He was Lord Ngai's man, why did you have to do this?

933
01:26:05,912 --> 01:26:08,081
What's the small sacrifice of one man?

934
01:26:08,373 --> 01:26:10,375
Fatty Heoi died at Patience Clan's,

935
01:26:10,667 --> 01:26:13,920
- so it gave us a good reason to bring men! - Tong Huo-wan,

936
01:26:14,420 --> 01:26:16,131
there's merely three people left now.

937
01:26:16,422 --> 01:26:20,051
If you kill them, the Patience Clan will be finished from then on.

938
01:26:20,468 --> 01:26:22,387
Also, your task will be complete.

939
01:26:28,309 --> 01:26:30,478
Your group of men are truly mean and shameless.

940
01:26:30,770 --> 01:26:32,772
I, Tong Huo-wan, will not be used by you.

941
01:26:34,023 --> 01:26:36,192
Don't forget what we agreed yesterday.

942
01:26:36,776 --> 01:26:38,153
If you don't keep your promise,

943
01:26:38,862 --> 01:26:40,582
you think you can still return to Tong Saan?

944
01:26:40,947 --> 01:26:43,116
To an animal, promises don't apply.

945
01:26:43,658 --> 01:26:45,451
If you don't listen to my orders,

946
01:26:45,994 --> 01:26:48,329
you ought to know how I can deal with you.

947
01:26:51,249 --> 01:26:53,126
What do you think you'll do with me?

948
01:26:53,585 --> 01:26:55,545
Whoever isn't afraid to die, come out!

949
01:26:56,588 --> 01:26:57,755
Let me tell you,

950
01:26:58,047 --> 01:26:59,507
as long as Tong Huo-wan is here,

951
01:26:59,966 --> 01:27:01,342
no one will hurt Master Chung!

952
01:27:03,970 --> 01:27:05,138
Damned kid,

953
01:27:05,430 --> 01:27:06,681
you think you're amazing?

954
01:27:06,973 --> 01:27:09,573
You really think you're a good fighter that can never be defeated?

955
01:27:22,780 --> 01:27:23,780
Bastard...

956
01:27:28,703 --> 01:27:29,703
Tong Huo-wan!

957
01:27:30,747 --> 01:27:31,747
Look.

958
01:27:36,336 --> 01:27:38,880
Ngai Cong-long, you...

959
01:27:39,756 --> 01:27:41,841
They're both in my hands.

960
01:27:42,425 --> 01:27:44,177
You must think carefully.

961
01:27:45,261 --> 01:27:46,554
I'll be honest with you,

962
01:27:46,846 --> 01:27:50,141
your mistress wasn't ill at all, it was me that poisoned her.

963
01:27:51,017 --> 01:27:53,394
After you kill the three of them,

964
01:27:53,686 --> 01:27:56,648
I'll give you the antidote and let you return to Tong Saan.

965
01:27:57,106 --> 01:27:58,483
You and I will be finished.

966
01:27:59,359 --> 01:28:01,486
This was my last step.

967
01:28:01,819 --> 01:28:03,905
It was me who sent Saam with the poison.

968
01:28:04,322 --> 01:28:06,741
If you don't comply with what Big Brother says,

969
01:28:07,575 --> 01:28:10,119
then your mistress will surely die from the pain,

970
01:28:10,745 --> 01:28:13,122
so you better listen.

971
01:28:14,207 --> 01:28:15,833
If you stay arrogant...

972
01:28:16,125 --> 01:28:17,752
Whenever I raise my hand,

973
01:28:18,920 --> 01:28:21,130
these two lives will be finished.

974
01:28:21,714 --> 01:28:24,842
Huo-wan, why did you conceal this from me?

975
01:28:25,134 --> 01:28:27,054
Why did you have to work for this kind of people?

976
01:28:27,345 --> 01:28:29,305
I...

977
01:28:31,391 --> 01:28:33,810
Ngai Cong-long, don't force him.

978
01:28:34,602 --> 01:28:35,645
Huo-wan,

979
01:28:35,937 --> 01:28:37,857
your master was loyal and righteous all his life.

980
01:28:37,939 --> 01:28:41,359
If you help this evildoer, he won't rest in peace.

981
01:28:41,651 --> 01:28:42,735
For me,

982
01:28:43,027 --> 01:28:45,154
for the righteousness of the Tong Saan School,

983
01:28:45,655 --> 01:28:47,699
you take good care of your sister.

984
01:28:48,992 --> 01:28:50,994
Mum!

985
01:28:51,661 --> 01:28:53,997
Mum!

986
01:28:55,123 --> 01:28:56,249
Mum!

987
01:29:00,962 --> 01:29:02,547
Mistress.

988
01:29:02,839 --> 01:29:03,839
Hey.

989
01:29:58,770 --> 01:30:01,147
- Hit him! - You animal. I'll beat you to death!

990
01:30:01,439 --> 01:30:04,525
I'll beat you to death!

991
01:36:00,089 --> 01:36:00,798
Hey.

992
01:36:01,090 --> 01:36:03,300
- Let's go. - Let's go. Quickly!

993
01:36:07,805 --> 01:36:08,805
Brother.

994
01:36:34,999 --> 01:36:36,751
- Mistress. - Mum!
