1 
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,720 
Swarms are one of the greatest spectacles on earth. 
 
2 
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:15,320 
At times horrifying, and also a thing of wonder. 
 
3 
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:19,840 
As part of the swarm, 
 
4 
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,720 
the smallest of creatures can become a force of nature. 
 
5 
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:26,720 
I'm George McGavin, a zoologist and explorer 
 
6 
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,800 
and I'll be travelling the globe to get right into the heart 
 
7 
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:34,000 
of some of the world's most impressive swarms. 
 
9 
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:43,400 
I want to show you that far from being the ultimate nightmare, 
 
10 
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:47,840 
swarms are one of nature's most ingenious solutions. 
 
11 
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:48,840 
Ow! 
 
12 
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,840 
Swarms are extremely powerful. 
 
13 
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,800 
By joining together, 
 
14 
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:12,640 
even the simplest of creatures can achieve the impossible. 
 
15 
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,760 
And by understanding how swarms work, 
 
16 
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,160 
we're gaining some fascinating insight into our own lives. 
 
17 
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,200 
My journey begins in North America, in southern California. 
 
18 
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,760 
I am hitting the highway in pursuit of a swarm most sane people 
 
19 
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,880 
would go out of their way to avoid. 
 
20 
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,920 
At some point, 
 
21 
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,240 
this little insect's sting might have totally ruined your day. 
 
22 
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,240 
Whoo, damn! 
 
23 
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:06,880 
But in extreme cases, this is a swarm that can kill. 
 
24 
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,920 
I don't think you want to be outside right now. There is a swarm of bees. 
 
25 
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,880 
The honeybee. 
 
26 
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:21,520 
A terrifying swarm, 
 
27 
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:27,160 
but one that worldwide is worth a staggering $180 billion a year. 
 
28 
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:33,280 
Without them, over a third of all the food we eat wouldn't exist. 
 
29 
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,640 
And nowhere is the bee's pollinating handiwork more crucial than here. 
 
30 
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:42,860 
California. 
 
31 
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,240 
More fruit and vegetables are produced in this state 
 
32 
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,000 
than anywhere else in America. 
 
33 
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,040 
And bees are so important to the process that every year, 
 
34 
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,280 
farmers actually import almost 2 million hive-loads of them. 
 
35 
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,480 
This is the perfect place to understand the secret of the swarm 
 
36 
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,480 
that takes group intelligence to a completely new level. 
 
37 
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:21,200 
To understand how it works, 
 
38 
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:25,920 
I need to get right to the start of the swarm, to the moment a queen 
 
39 
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,960 
gathers a loyal team of workers around her and goes house hunting. 
 
40 
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,760 
Now, in this temporary swarming state, 
 
41 
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,240 
they are really non-aggressive 
 
42 
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,240 
because they're not protecting anything, 
 
43 
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,080 
they're not protecting young, or honey - 
 
44 
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,360 
they are simply protecting or shielding the queen 
 
45 
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,320 
that's in the heart of their swarm until a new home is found, 
 
46 
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,240 
and they are so relaxed non-aggressive 
 
47 
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:52,120 
that I can actually put my hand right into the swarm here 
 
48 
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,520 
and just jiggle off a little handful of bees. 
 
49 
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,840 
Now, there's no way I could do this with a normal hive. 
 
50 
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,880 
It's only possible when they're in this temporary swarming state. 
 
51 
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,400 
Now, if I can persuade the worker bees that I'm a queen bee, 
 
52 
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,240 
they should swarm around me. 
 
53 
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,880 
It's only going to be possible because the swarm sticks together 
 
54 
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,920 
by following chemical signals called pheromones. 
 
55 
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,800 
Looks have nothing to do with it. 
 
56 
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,560 
It's an attraction so powerful that the bees should be prepared 
 
57 
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:32,080 
to ignore the obvious and accept me as their queen. 
 
58 
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,720 
To put it to the test, 
 
59 
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:38,800 
honey bee expert Norman Gary is giving me a queen bee makeover. 
 
60 
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:45,000 
I'm going to put droplets of a pheromone mix on your clothing. 
 
61 
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,600 
That pheromone is the odour that the queen bee emits 
 
62 
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,640 
that makes the other workers swarm around it. 
 
63 
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:56,240 
These are all females, did you know that? The females are now loving you. 
 
64 
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,720 
Yeah. 
 
65 
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,640 
Have fun, George! Hah! 
 
66 
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,200 
There's no backing out now. 
 
67 
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,280 
My only defence is a bit of insect repellent on my face.' 
 
68 
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,640 
I'm gonna start low, George, 
 
69 
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:13,240 
because they tend to migrate up, so here we go. 
 
70 
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:16,960 
There you go. 
 
71 
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:23,520 
At this stage, it's hard to tell 
 
72 
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,960 
whether the bees are going to stick around. 
 
73 
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,120 
And if I'm honest, right now, I'm not sure I want them to.' 
 
74 
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:33,200 
This is not funny, because... 
 
75 
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,080 
It's in my eye, it's in my eye! Argh! 
 
76 
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,920 
Just relax. 
 
77 
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:48,280 
I am relaxed. I'm so chilled, I can't tell you. 
 
78 
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,000 
It looks like the workers have been fooled. 
 
79 
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,000 
I'm really beginning to get a sense of what it must feel like to 
 
80 
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:04,080 
be the queen bee in the centre of a massive swarm of bees. 
 
81 
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,600 
And being part of the swarm is starting to feel even weirder 
 
82 
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,240 
than it looks. I can now feel the weight of the bees on my chest. 
 
83 
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:15,760 
There's a fair few of them and collectively, 
 
84 
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:20,320 
they're beginning to feel quite heavy, like wearing a wet shirt. 
 
85 
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,040 
The other thing that's quite obvious is the heat. 
 
86 
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:25,880 
Because I'm covered in a layer of active bees 
 
87 
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:28,960 
that are vibrating their wings, they are generating 
 
88 
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,760 
quite a bit of heat and that's being transmitted to me through my shirt. 
 
89 
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,960 
I can really feel like I'm wearing a sort of woollen jumper. 
 
90 
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,520 
It's incredibly unsettling. 
 
91 
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,560 
I'm only safe from attack because this swarm is in 
 
92 
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:49,680 
this temporary state, but that needs to change. 
 
93 
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,680 
The bees face a critical decision on where to set up 
 
94 
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,880 
their permanent home. 
 
95 
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,200 
It's vital they get it right. 
 
96 
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:02,400 
Get it wrong, and the swarm will die. 
 
97 
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,280 
So how do 40,000 individuals reach a unanimous decision?' 
 
98 
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,360 
Although the queen is central to the formation of the swarm, 
 
99 
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,280 
it's not her that takes any part in the decision 
 
100 
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,680 
about where the swarm will end up, where they'll have their new home. 
 
101 
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,400 
But in order to show you how that works, 
 
102 
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,320 
I'm going to have to move this swarm off me. 
 
103 
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,160 
Wonderful. Perfect, perfect. 
 
104 
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,440 
With the swarm now airborne, 
 
105 
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,520 
they don't have long to make a decision 
 
106 
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,640 
and to see how they do it, we've set up an experiment. 
 
107 
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:46,440 
I've given the bees a choice of three new hives, 
 
108 
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:48,880 
only one of which is suitable. 
 
109 
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,840 
Hive A has a small enough entrance to keep out any predators, 
 
110 
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:57,320 
but it's not big enough for the swarm to grow. 
 
111 
00:07:57,320 --> 00:08:01,560 
Hive B is larger, so there's room for the bees to expand, 
 
112 
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:04,760 
but the entrance is too big to protect them. 
 
113 
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:08,200 
It all rests on hive C. 
 
114 
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,400 
The one they should really go for is this one over here. 
 
115 
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,320 
It's the right size, it's got room for growth, 
 
116 
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,640 
the entrance hole is also the right size, 
 
117 
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:22,480 
so this, if I was a bee, this is the one I'd be going for. 
 
118 
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,960 
The question is, will the bees choose the right one? 
 
119 
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:32,280 
The first thing the swarm does is send out the scouts. 
 
120 
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,680 
It's their job to search for a new home, inspect the premises, 
 
121 
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,120 
and report back. 
 
122 
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:44,800 
They're looking for a nice, roomy hive, safe from predators 
 
123 
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,680 
and south-facing, to make the most of the early morning sun. 
 
124 
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,360 
And after a thorough investigation of all three hives, 
 
125 
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:57,360 
it's time to head back to base. 
 
126 
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:03,680 
What's really amazing about all this is the way that the scout bees 
 
127 
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:07,120 
communicate that vital information back to the swarm. 
 
128 
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,440 
It's all about the waggle dance. 
 
129 
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,400 
With their best dance moves, 
 
130 
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:28,080 
the scouts tell other bees which direction to go. 
 
131 
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,920 
The length of the waggling gives them a distance. 
 
132 
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:36,680 
One second of waggle equals half a mile of flying. But that's not all. 
 
133 
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:40,040 
The energy that they perform that dance 
 
134 
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,520 
indicates the quality of the house. Look at this one here. 
 
135 
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,800 
She is really going for it. This is a really high-energy waggle dance. 
 
136 
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:50,840 
Lots of enthusiasm. She's doing it over and over again. 
 
137 
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,720 
And that will tell the rest of the swarm 
 
138 
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,320 
that what she's found could be the perfect home. 
 
139 
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,760 
We used to think that the decision 
 
140 
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,400 
was all down to the bees' waggle dance. 
 
141 
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:09,320 
When enough bees dance for the same hive, a decision was made. 
 
142 
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:13,160 
But recently, scientists realised there was something much 
 
143 
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,840 
more interesting happening on the dance floor. 
 
144 
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:23,680 
Some of the dancing bees were on the receiving end 
 
145 
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,680 
of a sneaky head-butt, a signal to stop dancing. 
 
146 
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:32,080 
So it's actually a combination of enthusiasm and bullying 
 
147 
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:37,360 
that helps the bees agree and prevents a decision deadlock. 
 
148 
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,440 
So what does this swarm make of the three hives? 
 
149 
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,080 
Jeez! They're everywhere. 
 
150 
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,320 
Well, those 40,000 bees have now taken to the air, 
 
151 
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:52,920 
absolutely full of...the noise is incredible 
 
152 
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,200 
and they're all heading to that 
hive over there 
 
153 
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,000 
and so far, not one sting. 
 
154 
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,080 
Ooh! Ow! 
 
155 
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:05,080 
Something just got me! 
Sorry, correction - one sting! 
 
156 
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,800 
And while two of the hives 
are still empty, 
 
157 
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:13,480 
hive C is proving popular and 
the bees are moving in en masse. 
 
158 
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,320 
They've made the decision 
collectively 
 
159 
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,000 
and they've picked this hive. This 
was the one I thought they'd pick. 
 
160 
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,240 
It's absolutely right, 
is the right size. 
 
161 
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,880 
It's the perfect angle, 
the perfect everything. 
 
162 
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,960 
And it's their group 
intelligence, 
 
163 
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:33,200 
the ability to use the power 
of the swarm to make the right 
 
164 
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,240 
decision that makes honeybees 
the ultimate team... 
 
165 
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:44,400 
Because it's a fact that hundreds 
of individuals 
 
166 
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,240 
make a better decision together 
than a single expert. 
 
167 
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,920 
And that's something both animal 
swarms and humans have in common. 
 
168 
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,840 
It's a bizarre phenomenon first 
noticed back in 1906 
 
169 
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,720 
at a county show much like this one. 
 
170 
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,200 
Ha ha! 
 
171 
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:21,160 
Scientists were amazed by what 
happens during a simple competition 
 
172 
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:24,320 
asking people to guess the weight 
of a cow. 
 
173 
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:27,240 
When they analysed the results, 
not only was the average 
 
174 
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,040 
of everyone's guesses more accurate 
than the winning guess, 
 
175 
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:35,320 
it was also a much better guess than 
that of the experts who took part. 
 
176 
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:38,400 
So today, we're going to put 
it to the test 
 
177 
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,600 
with the help of Zinny here. 
 
178 
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:46,920 
We asked a selection of people 
at the Royal Bath Show 
 
179 
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,680 
to guess Zinny's weight. 
 
180 
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,920 
How accurate will they be as a group 
and can they beat one of the pros? 
 
181 
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,080 
Right, well, the results are in 
 
182 
00:12:56,080 --> 00:13:00,320 
and all I've got to do now is to add 
up all the estimates 
 
183 
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,640 
from the crowd, get a total, 
 
184 
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:08,400 
divide that by the number of people 
who guessed... 
 
185 
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,960 
The answer we get is 588 kilograms. 
 
186 
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:19,080 
Now, a livestock expert guessed 584, 
so they're very close. 
 
187 
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,600 
But who's closest? 
 
188 
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,560 
It's time for the cow to reveal all. 
 
189 
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:30,240 
Haven't got her back legs in yet! 
Haven't got her back legs in. 
 
190 
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,720 
595 kilograms. Incredible! 
 
191 
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:43,400 
That's just seven kilograms higher 
than the group's estimate. 
 
192 
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,640 
The crowd got it just about spot-on, 
and they beat the experts. 
 
193 
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,760 
It seems many brains 
really are better than one, 
 
194 
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:57,400 
and that's due to something 
known as The Wisdom of the Crowd. 
 
195 
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:00,880 
Our highest guess was 1,400 kg, 
 
196 
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,000 
and our lowest 200 kg. 
 
197 
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,360 
So, both way off, 
 
198 
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:10,000 
but when a crowd works together 
the odd crazy guess 
 
199 
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,600 
doesn't really matter. 
 
200 
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,920 
And that works for nature, too. 
 
201 
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,600 
One animal might make a bad 
decision, 
 
202 
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:23,080 
but unless others have the same 
reaction, the swarm isn't fooled. 
 
203 
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:28,000 
That's why taking the option to ask 
the audience in a game show 
 
204 
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,160 
is such a smart move. 
 
205 
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,800 
They get it right about 90% 
of the time, 
 
206 
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,440 
compared with a 65% success rate 
from the experts. 
 
207 
00:14:38,640 --> 00:14:41,880 
It's no wonder swarming has helped 
some creatures become 
 
208 
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,080 
the ultimate decision-makers. 
 
209 
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,920 
But not all swarms 
are about boosting brainpower. 
 
210 
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,640 
Some are about working together 
to solve a problem. 
 
211 
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,240 
The next stop on my journey 
is Christmas Islands, 
 
212 
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,400 
a tiny volcanic outcrop 
in the Indian Ocean. 
 
213 
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,960 
This dramatic, otherworldly 
landscape 
 
214 
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:15,360 
is the setting for an extraordinary 
swarm on the move. 
 
215 
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:21,520 
And right now is the best time 
to see it in action. 
 
216 
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,200 
Oh, my God, that is so... 
 
217 
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:31,480 
The island is about to go 
into lockdown. 
 
218 
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:37,960 
Every year as the monsoon rains 
arrive, 
 
219 
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:42,640 
60 million red crabs emerge 
out of the trees. 
 
220 
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,760 
A swarm facing the ultimate 
challenge. 
 
221 
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,160 
These land crabs live in a forest. 
 
222 
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:07,080 
But like their coastal ancestors, 
 
223 
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,840 
they're still completely dependent 
on the sea to breed. 
 
224 
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:16,720 
And between the forest 
and the beach 
 
225 
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,960 
lies a gruelling six-mile treck. 
 
226 
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:27,040 
This one is a female. 
 
227 
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,920 
You can see underneath... 
 
228 
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,200 
Gosh, she's really skittish. 
 
229 
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,440 
If I hold her very carefully 
you can see underneath 
 
230 
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:37,680 
that brown mass at the end of her 
abdomen under her tail, 
 
231 
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,920 
is something like 100,000 eggs. 
 
232 
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:45,440 
The reason that the females are 
a little more difficult to handle, 
 
233 
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:48,640 
they're much more flighty, 
is because all they've got 
 
234 
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:52,120 
on their mind just now 
is to get these eggs... 
 
235 
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:55,360 
Ow! ..into the sea as fast 
as they can. 
 
236 
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,720 
So that's what she has to do now, 
so I'm just going to let her... 
 
237 
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,840 
Oh, if I can get... 
 
238 
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:03,000 
..get on her way. 
 
239 
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,880 
She knows exactly which way to go. 
 
240 
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:09,760 
The Christmas Islands crabs follow 
the same well-trodden route 
 
241 
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,200 
for generations. 
 
242 
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,720 
But the arrival of humans 
on the island 
 
243 
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:23,040 
has given them a few extra obstacles 
to deal with. 
 
244 
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:32,080 
But nothing can get in the way 
of their epic journey. 
 
245 
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:41,840 
In just over a week, the crabs 
will cover up to six miles. 
 
246 
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:47,640 
For a creature of this size that 
spends most of its life underground, 
 
247 
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,920 
that's like running several 
back-to-back marathons 
 
248 
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,360 
with no training. 
 
249 
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,080 
So how do they do it? 
 
250 
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,480 
Scientists have recently discovered 
 
251 
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:10,760 
it's all thanks 
to a special internal sugar reserve. 
 
252 
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,560 
Powered by a massive sugar rush 
once a year, 
 
253 
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,440 
these laidback forest creatures 
 
254 
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,400 
suddenly turn into long-distance 
athletes. 
 
255 
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,520 
Oh, my goodness! Look at this! 
This is... 
 
256 
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,240 
This is unbelievable. 
 
257 
00:18:43,240 --> 00:18:46,040 
There's just crabs as far 
as the eye can see. 
 
258 
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:48,880 
Every inch of this rock is covered. 
 
259 
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:55,680 
Amazingly, after days of walking 
and dodging obstacles, 
 
260 
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,280 
tens of millions of crabs have 
survived and made it to the beach. 
 
261 
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,720 
Just in time for their next big 
challenge. 
 
262 
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,080 
Tonight's the night. 
 
263 
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,840 
They've got to shed their eggs 
on a pre-dawn high tide, 
 
264 
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:13,080 
when the difference between high 
and low tide is at the smallest, 
 
265 
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:16,320 
because if they fall in the sea, 
they drown, unbelievably. 
 
266 
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,960 
Being land crabs, 
they can't survive in the sea. 
 
267 
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,960 
But they've got to get their eggs 
in the sea. 
 
268 
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,840 
They all have just one tiny 
window of opportunity. 
 
269 
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,800 
And according to my calculations, 
 
270 
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:37,240 
that should be in about 
six hours' time. 
 
271 
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:43,640 
So, I'm taking my place with 
the crabs and waiting for high tide. 
 
272 
00:19:56,360 --> 00:20:00,400 
It's 3am, and all around me 
female crabs have just started 
 
273 
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,560 
frantically scrambling 
to the edge of the surf. 
 
274 
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,800 
Well, this is it. 
 
275 
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:15,000 
The annual mass spawning 
has started, 
 
276 
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:18,480 
and it is just one of the most 
incredible things I've ever seen. 
 
277 
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:25,000 
It's easy to forget how treacherous 
this moment is for the crabs. 
 
278 
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,080 
Many of them will get 
washed away and drowned. 
 
279 
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:33,360 
But it's a risk they have to take. 
 
280 
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:36,560 
The crabs are actually spawning 
all around me. 
 
281 
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,720 
Every time they spawn, they put 
their claws up 
 
282 
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,960 
and they shake themselves, 
 
283 
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,440 
and as they do that 
they shed 100,000 eggs each. 
 
284 
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:53,000 
So many trillions of eggs have been 
shed into the Indian Ocean 
 
285 
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,480 
that it's turned into soup. 
 
286 
00:20:56,920 --> 00:21:02,360 
That is just full of now 
freshly-hatched crab eggs. 
 
287 
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:09,640 
The minute they hit the seawater, 
the eggs hatch into tiny larvae. 
 
288 
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:13,840 
But now they're at the mercy 
of tides and currents. 
 
289 
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,800 
Most will end up as fish food or get 
swept away into deeper waters, 
 
290 
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,200 
never to be seen again. 
 
291 
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,400 
Which is why this swarm is so vital. 
 
292 
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:29,600 
To ensure the survival of just 
a few crabs, 
 
293 
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:33,400 
nature has to throw 
a lot of zeros at the problem. 
 
294 
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:37,120 
Over the next three days, 
something like three trillion 
 
295 
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:42,160 
individual crab larvae will be 
released into the Indian Ocean. 
 
296 
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,080 
But despite the incredible numbers, 
the baby crabs will only make it 
 
297 
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:53,560 
back to shore every six 
or seven years. 
 
298 
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:58,160 
And when they do, the scenes 
are spectacular. 
 
299 
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:04,840 
A super-swarm of tiny crabs 
defies the odds 
 
300 
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,120 
and climbs back out of the ocean. 
 
301 
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,200 
For a land crab 
trapped in a forest, 
 
302 
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:15,840 
this swarm has the ultimate 
survival strategy. 
 
303 
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,560 
And across the globe, 
 
304 
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:24,200 
there are similarly amazing sights 
as other swarms set off on the move. 
 
305 
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:30,080 
Individually, each animal has no 
idea which way they're heading. 
 
306 
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:35,480 
But as a group, somehow they all 
move in the same direction. 
 
307 
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,120 
But how do you get tens of millions 
of individuals 
 
308 
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,680 
to work together as a team? 
 
309 
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,760 
Well, strangely, it's all thanks 
to having nobody in charge. 
 
310 
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,880 
It might sound like a recipe 
for disaster, 
 
311 
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,520 
but if you look at a colony 
of leafcutter ants, 
 
312 
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:58,760 
everyone is doing their own thing. 
 
313 
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,640 
No single ant is in charge 
of organisation, not even the queen. 
 
314 
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,920 
But with every ant ignoring 
the bigger picture 
 
315 
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:13,960 
and focusing on the one job, 
 
316 
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:17,320 
the process actually becomes 
highly efficient. 
 
317 
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:24,160 
So, by thinking like ants, 
we're now changing the way 
 
318 
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:27,320 
we look at some of our 
own logistics. 
 
319 
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:32,880 
Every day, millions of us travel 
through the world's transport hubs. 
 
320 
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,920 
Getting from A to B by the most 
efficient route is vital 
 
321 
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,120 
to keeping things running smoothly. 
 
322 
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:46,440 
Something the ants do really well. 
So, how would they run an airport? 
 
323 
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:51,560 
By designing software capable 
of thinking like a swarm, 
 
324 
00:23:51,560 --> 00:23:52,960 
we've been finding out. 
 
325 
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:57,680 
An American airline tried to solve 
a long-running debate - 
 
326 
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:02,480 
was it faster to board a plane by 
giving passengers allocated seating 
 
327 
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:05,800 
or by allowing them to pick 
their own seats? 
 
328 
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,040 
Surprisingly, 
 
329 
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:11,480 
when the computer programme used 
digital ants to fill the plane, 
 
330 
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,960 
it showed that sometimes, letting 
people choose their own seats 
 
331 
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,400 
is quicker than giving them 
seat numbers. 
 
332 
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:23,600 
Because when there's no top dog 
to make decisions for us, 
 
333 
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,920 
like the ants, we all have to think 
for ourselves, 
 
334 
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,000 
and it doesn't result in the chaos 
you'd expect. 
 
335 
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:37,520 
And new technology is taking this 
even further, 
 
336 
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:40,120 
with robots that use 
swarm intelligence. 
 
337 
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:47,400 
Just like insects, 
these robots all do their own thing. 
 
338 
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:57,000 
By reacting to each other, 
they can combine to do things 
 
339 
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,800 
that would be impossible 
on their own. 
 
340 
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,320 
The hope is that one day 
these robots could be sent out 
 
341 
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,600 
into some of our most 
dangerous locations. 
 
342 
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:10,960 
Artificial swarms working together 
on the front line, 
 
343 
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,240 
or on search and rescue missions, 
 
344 
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,080 
replacing humans and potentially 
saving lives. 
 
345 
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:21,720 
But while some swarms work 
together day after day, 
 
346 
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:26,600 
other swarms exist for only 
a few hours. 
 
347 
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,720 
Coordination is critical. 
 
348 
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:34,960 
Get it wrong, 
and your whole life has been wasted. 
 
349 
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:40,440 
This is a swarm that's seen 
on just a few nights of the year. 
 
350 
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:45,480 
Oh, my God! 
It's a blackout. 
 
351 
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,920 
GIRL SCREAMS 
 
352 
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,440 
Yes. They are alive. 
 
353 
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,800 
To be in with a chance of finding 
this swarm, 
 
354 
00:25:57,800 --> 00:26:00,920 
I'm travelling to the States, 
to Wisconsin. 
 
355 
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,720 
I'm chasing a massive swarm 
that appears from nowhere, 
 
356 
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:13,200 
so this part of my journey 
will be a race against time. 
 
357 
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,960 
To get a sense of the challenge 
ahead, 
 
358 
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,800 
I've come to the local weather 
centre in La Crosse, 
 
359 
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:25,400 
where they've been keeping a close 
eye on the swarm's past movements. 
 
360 
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:29,280 
That is just incredible! 
It's like an explosion. 
 
361 
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:32,040 
Right, this was just after sundown. 
 
362 
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:35,480 
Some biological target is coming 
out of the river 
 
363 
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,960 
and then being carried by the wind 
away from the Mississippi River. 
 
364 
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,400 
If I could see that, 
if that happened again, 
 
365 
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,800 
or even anything 
remotely like that... 
 
366 
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,640 
I would be very, very happy. 
 
367 
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:53,560 
So, what swarm could be so intense 
that it shows up on weather radars? 
 
368 
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,080 
Well, for just a few days every 
summer, amazingly, millions, 
 
369 
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:08,640 
some say trillions of mayflies take 
to the sky to form dense clouds. 
 
370 
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:14,240 
It's a blizzard of insects thick 
enough to stop traffic. 
 
371 
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,920 
But despite the massive size of this 
swarm, it's unpredictable, 
 
372 
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,880 
so finding it won't be easy. 
 
373 
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:28,720 
Time for me to take to the airways. 
 
374 
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,000 
Well, I'm in the right place and 
it's more or less the right time. 
 
375 
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,000 
But if I'm going to see a really 
big swarm, 
 
376 
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,200 
I've got an idea of how 
I can enlist some local help. 
 
377 
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:43,920 
Downtown La Crosse. 
It's now 14.10. WIZM. 
 
378 
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,200 
I'm George McGavin 
and we're from the BBC. 
 
379 
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,880 
RADIO DJ: Swarms of mayflies have 
attracted the attention 
 
380 
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,120 
of famed entomologist 
and TV host George McGavin. 
 
381 
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,560 
For a lot of people around here 
it's going to be surprising 
 
382 
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,800 
to hear that you want to be 
in the swarm. When we see 
 
383 
00:27:59,800 --> 00:28:01,840 
those swarms we want to get 
in our car, get inside 
 
384 
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,960 
and get away from it. 
Why? It's fantastic. 
 
385 
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:08,000 
For an insect to be able to halt 
a train or a car, you know, 
 
386 
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:09,360 
that's pretty special. 
 
387 
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,320 
That's something 
I really want to see. 
 
388 
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,120 
We just need mayflies, lots of them. 
 
389 
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,520 
And they can call any time, day or 
night? Absolutely. We'll be there. 
 
390 
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,520 
We'll be hot on the heels 
of the swarm. 
 
391 
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:34,160 
I just hope we get the phone calls. 
I just hope we get folks ringing. 
 
392 
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,360 
We've done what we can, 
 
393 
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:40,200 
but it's impossible to predict where 
the first sighting will come from. 
 
394 
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,440 
One thing we do know is, 
 
395 
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,920 
they all start off in the same 
place - the Mississippi River. 
 
396 
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,600 
Mayflies spend most of their lives 
hidden underwater. 
 
397 
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:56,040 
So by looking in the river, 
 
398 
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:59,520 
I should be able to get right 
to the source of this swarm. 
 
399 
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,360 
So now, hopefully, in here 
 
400 
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,400 
are one or two or more 
mayfly nymphs. 
 
401 
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:13,160 
In a good year, a grab of that size 
might contain 15 nymphs, 
 
402 
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,560 
and if you think of that, 
it's a very small area 
 
403 
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:18,000 
and if you multiply it 
by this vast area, 
 
404 
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:22,120 
that's the sort of volumes 
of animals that we're hunting for. 
 
405 
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,600 
Oh, here, we got one. 
 
406 
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,440 
So, that's what we're after. 
 
407 
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,960 
This is a mayfly nymph, 
 
408 
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,800 
and they're perfectly adapted 
for existing in silt. 
 
409 
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:34,440 
They're very streamlined. 
They've got two tusks 
 
410 
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,080 
at the front of the head 
for excavating through the mud. 
 
411 
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:39,920 
They've got these really strong 
front legs, as well, 
 
412 
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,240 
which have little 
sort of prongs on them. 
 
413 
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,000 
So they are the perfect silt 
inhabitants, 
 
414 
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:48,560 
and they stay there for perhaps 
a year, up to two years... 
 
415 
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:53,920 
Until all conditions are right 
to trigger a mass emergence. 
 
416 
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:58,400 
It's thought water temperature 
has a lot to do with it, 
 
417 
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,440 
but lots of other factors like 
weather and food supply 
 
418 
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,120 
also play a role, 
 
419 
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:09,560 
making it frustratingly difficult to 
predict what's going on down there. 
 
420 
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,560 
Unless you're a mayfly, that is. 
 
421 
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:21,360 
With just 24 hours to emerge, 
find a mate, breed 
 
422 
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,600 
and get back to the river, 
 
423 
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,200 
it's a race against time 
for survival. 
 
424 
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:29,120 
Miss it by just a few hours, 
 
425 
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:32,920 
and you'll miss your one 
and only chance to find a mate. 
 
426 
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,040 
And I'm racing against 
the clock, too. 
 
427 
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,320 
Time to get back out on the road 
and keep looking. 
 
428 
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,200 
A swarm of mayflies could form 
anywhere along the river. 
 
429 
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,840 
But towns and roads are a good place 
to start looking 
 
430 
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:57,480 
because there's one thing 
they just can't seem to resist. 
 
431 
00:30:58,520 --> 00:30:59,760 
Lights. 
 
432 
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,920 
The brighter, the better. 
 
433 
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:10,280 
So our shiny new modern lights 
play havoc with them, 
 
434 
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:13,160 
and bring chaos to our towns. 
 
435 
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:20,840 
It could be that the lights 
are a giant mayfly singles bar. 
 
436 
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,600 
With just hours to breed, 
 
437 
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,160 
there's not much time to fly about 
and look for a mate. 
 
438 
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,400 
So, by all heading to 
the nearest bright light, 
 
439 
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:34,440 
you improve your chances 
of finding a partner. 
 
440 
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:39,600 
And just as I was about to give up 
hope 
 
441 
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,440 
of getting to see this 
incredible event in action, 
 
442 
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:44,200 
there's some promising news. 
 
443 
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:51,520 
I've just had a phone 
call from a boat yard up here. 
 
444 
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:54,520 
This looks like the marina, 
 
445 
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:56,240 
so I hope I'm in the right place. 
 
446 
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,840 
Oh! Oh-ho! 
 
447 
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:03,560 
Mayflies, flying. 
Look, there's one on the window. 
 
448 
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,040 
Whoa, this is more like it. 
 
449 
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,440 
Whoa! Look at this! 
 
450 
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:11,440 
We've caught the very beginnings 
of a swarm.' 
 
451 
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,520 
These guys will have left the river 
late last night last night, 
 
452 
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,760 
looking for a landing spot 
 
453 
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:21,840 
where they can go through one 
final transformation. 
 
454 
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,880 
This is incredible. 
 
455 
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:29,880 
This is the emergence of an adult 
mayfly from the sub-adult, 
 
456 
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:34,600 
and this is a process that has been 
going on for 300 million years. 
 
457 
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:37,840 
This is incredible to watch. 
 
458 
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:41,960 
Now, it's still got to get 
the end of its abdomen out, 
 
459 
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,280 
and it's got to draw out 
those long tails. 
 
460 
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:50,800 
And this exact process 
is being repeated 
 
461 
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,680 
hundreds of millions of times. 
 
462 
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,720 
In a few hours' time, 
 
463 
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,640 
all the new adults will 
rise into the air in a huge swarm. 
 
464 
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:16,480 
The mayfly have spent their entire 
lives in the mud, 
 
465 
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,520 
waiting for this brief 
and all-important moment. 
 
466 
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,960 
By evening, the sky fills 
with millions of them, 
 
467 
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,320 
in an intense breeding frenzy. 
 
468 
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:36,120 
Being part of the swarm is a once 
in a lifetime event for the mayfly. 
 
469 
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:42,680 
But other insects have to deal with 
a whole life in amongst the swarm. 
 
470 
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:46,320 
But then working together 
efficiently, is vital. 
 
471 
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,200 
Ant colonies are completely 
dependent on keeping the supplies 
 
472 
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,960 
coming in thick and fast. 
 
473 
00:33:58,520 --> 00:34:00,560 
With millions of hungry 
mouths to feed, 
 
474 
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,560 
any delay could be a disaster. 
 
475 
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,040 
So, they avoid a crisis by following 
a surprising highway code. 
 
476 
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:16,280 
To go as fast as possible, 
the ants have learned to slow down. 
 
477 
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:21,920 
That means no boy racers 
and no overtaking. 
 
478 
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:27,840 
And what works for the ants 
also works for us. 
 
479 
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,560 
Twice a day, our roads have to cope 
with millions of people 
 
480 
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:36,280 
all trying to be at the right 
place at the right time. 
 
481 
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:43,080 
Designing our transport networks 
to cope is a huge challenge. 
 
482 
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,840 
So, now, our road planners 
 
483 
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:50,080 
are starting to pick up 
a few tips from the ants. 
 
484 
00:34:57,000 --> 00:35:00,880 
By restricting each and every car 
to around 50 miles an hour, 
 
485 
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,920 
actually makes the journey faster. 
 
486 
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,960 
And although it might not 
seem like it, 
 
487 
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,760 
reducing the number of lanes 
 
488 
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:11,240 
and banning overtaking makes things 
even more efficient. 
 
489 
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,360 
And now several car companies are 
taking this a step further 
 
490 
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,800 
by looking into technology 
that keeps cars 
 
491 
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,960 
close behind each other 
and at a constant speed... 
 
492 
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,000 
..just like the travelling ants. 
 
493 
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:30,920 
That is just weird. 
 
494 
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,320 
These super-smart cars have sensors 
that read their speed 
 
495 
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,400 
and distance from the vehicle 
in front. 
 
496 
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:40,080 
I'm not touching the brake at all. 
 
497 
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:43,480 
All you have to do is hold the wheel 
and, if that car in front stops, 
 
498 
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:46,360 
the brakes are applied 
automatically... 
 
499 
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:47,880 
bringing me to a halt. 
 
500 
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:53,840 
I have to say, 
it really makes you very nervous. 
 
501 
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,320 
It's a very unsettling feeling 
 
502 
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,360 
not to be in control of the car, 
as it were. 
 
503 
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,600 
Stopping here - oh. 
 
504 
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:05,280 
Oh. Oh. 
 
505 
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,840 
Oh. 
HE LAUGHS 
 
506 
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,520 
I didn't touch the brake. 
 
507 
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,760 
Oh, my goodness. 
 
508 
00:36:13,760 --> 00:36:15,760 
These cars are so clever that even 
 
509 
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:18,280 
when the car in front brakes 
unexpectedly, 
 
510 
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:21,840 
the car has everything under 
control. 
 
511 
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:23,000 
Ah! 
 
512 
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,120 
Oh! 
 
513 
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:29,600 
Oh! 
 
514 
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:30,600 
Ah! 
 
515 
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,680 
Let me just get my breath back now. 
 
516 
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,760 
HE SIGHS 
That was unbelievable. 
 
517 
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,840 
I'm not sure I'm quite 
ready for a car with swarm powers 
 
518 
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:46,360 
but it's a genius idea. 
 
519 
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:51,520 
And with almost 40 million 
vehicles on UK roads, 
 
520 
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,200 
technology like this could be 
the answer to keeping traffic 
 
521 
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,640 
flowing with ant-like precision. 
 
522 
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,240 
But while some swarms are helping us 
overcome problems, 
 
523 
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:11,840 
others are just adding to them. 
 
524 
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:15,920 
In America, there's an unseen swarm 
that has silently invaded 
 
525 
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,760 
and is slowly taking over. 
 
526 
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:24,280 
In the last 40 years, 
it's spread into 23 states 
 
527 
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,800 
and yet remains largely 
hidden from view. 
 
528 
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:33,680 
The American government has spend 
over $150m trying to control it. 
 
529 
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:38,480 
It's a swarm that 
I have never experienced before 
 
530 
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:41,760 
and one that is not without 
considerable risk. 
 
531 
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:48,680 
For my chance to meet this swarm, 
 
532 
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,080 
I'm heading to Bath, Illinois, 
in the American Midwest. 
 
533 
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,800 
And it seems I'm not the only one 
 
534 
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:00,840 
here to meet this highly 
destructive swarm. 
 
535 
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:05,040 
There was a couple of guys that got 
black eyes that got hit in the face 
 
536 
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,640 
with no protection, and they're 
walking around here today. 
 
537 
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,960 
They got a big, old shiner. 
 
538 
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,200 
That looks painful. 
It was. 
 
539 
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,880 
This one was the first hit yesterday 
and one on this eye. 
 
540 
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:17,600 
And you're back for more. 
Back for more. This is dangerous. 
 
541 
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,480 
Yeah. We've been coming eight years. 
 
542 
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,160 
This is the first time we've ever 
got hurt, though. 
 
543 
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,000 
People say they eat them 
but, as nasty as they look, 
 
544 
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,040 
I ain't touching them. 
 
545 
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,080 
Just what have I let myself in for? 
 
546 
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,840 
To find out, the Illinois Natural 
History Team is going to get me 
 
547 
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,600 
face-to-face with the problem. 
 
548 
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:46,840 
Today, we're going to use 
a technique called electrofishing, 
 
549 
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:50,600 
and we're going to put anywhere from 
4,500 to 5,000 volts into the water. 
 
550 
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,880 
Well, 
this is the calm before the swarm. 
 
551 
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,840 
I have no idea what's going to 
happen. 
 
552 
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:13,560 
Wow! 
 
553 
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,920 
This is crazy! 
 
554 
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,240 
Argh! 
 
555 
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,680 
That is unbelievable. 
 
556 
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,320 
Oh! 
 
557 
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:26,960 
This is what I'm here for, 
the Asian silver carp, 
 
558 
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:31,640 
a fish with a unique panic reflex, 
causing it to leap out of the water. 
 
559 
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,520 
There are literally 
thousands of these carp. 
 
560 
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,960 
Arg! 
 
561 
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,560 
This is absolute insanity. 
 
562 
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:46,280 
Whether it's a predator, 
a boat or our electric current, 
 
563 
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:49,920 
a reflex response spreads 
through the swarm, 
 
564 
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,760 
setting off a chain 
reaction of leaping fish. 
 
565 
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:57,240 
It's a vital way of measuring 
 
566 
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,640 
just how many 
fish are lurking down there. 
 
567 
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:06,760 
At the moment, the best guess 
is 2,500 carp per mile of river 
 
568 
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,800 
but the numbers are still growing. 
 
569 
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,440 
And as carp numbers are going up, 
 
570 
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:15,000 
the amount of other 
wildlife is going down. 
 
571 
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:20,800 
I've never seen 
so much fish in my life. 
 
572 
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:23,240 
Oh! 
 
573 
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,200 
This is a swarm out of control 
and ecologically dangerous. 
 
574 
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,840 
Getting rid of it isn't going to be 
easy, but the battle is on. 
 
575 
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:39,040 
The big concern is that the carp 
are only 50 miles away 
 
576 
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:41,200 
from the great lakes of America. 
 
577 
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,760 
If they continue to spread 
in that direction, 
 
578 
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:47,600 
they could devastate 
a $4bn fishing industry. 
 
579 
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:54,240 
The US government have been 
spending $150m in the last two years 
 
580 
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,440 
just to control this species. 
 
581 
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,040 
Everybody all right? 
 
582 
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,360 
I got one on the backside. 
 
583 
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:03,200 
Unbelievable. 
 
584 
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:12,160 
So far, they've tried everything 
from poison to electric barriers, 
 
585 
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:14,960 
but nothing seems to be able 
to stop the carp. 
 
586 
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,360 
So, the locals have decided to take 
matters into their own hands. 
 
587 
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:31,720 
This fishing tournament 
is their chance to fight back. 
 
588 
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:35,000 
We're now in the middle of this 
fishing chaos. 
 
589 
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:39,040 
There's about 50 boats here. There's 
some more boats coming towards us. 
 
590 
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:43,480 
Whoa! That hit him right on the 
head, that. 
 
591 
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:47,240 
Carnage! 
 
592 
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,560 
Oh, jeez! 
 
593 
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,080 
HE LAUGHS 
 
594 
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,840 
I'm hanging on. 
 
595 
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,800 
But why have the carp got 
out of control? 
 
596 
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:58,680 
Ooh! 
 
597 
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:04,200 
They eat algae and because they eat 
so much of it, 
 
598 
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,640 
they are basically eating all 
of the food 
 
599 
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:08,840 
that the fish here would normally 
eat. 
 
600 
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,640 
The carp can eat up to 
a third of their body weight a day. 
 
601 
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,000 
Their ferocious appetite has 
pretty much emptied 
 
602 
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,080 
the river of food for anything else. 
 
603 
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:27,360 
This swarm is taking over. 
 
604 
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:31,200 
And the trouble with all this 
is, it's a purely man-made problem. 
 
605 
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:34,040 
These fish were 
introduced 40 years ago to clean 
 
606 
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:36,840 
the algae off commercial catfish 
ponds. 
 
607 
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,480 
When they escaped into nearby 
rivers, 
 
608 
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:44,400 
the carp found themselves 
in the river full of food 
 
609 
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,400 
and nothing to stand in their way. 
 
610 
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:52,360 
With each carp able to produce up to 
two million eggs a year, 
 
611 
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:55,960 
it didn't take 
long for the fish to become a swarm. 
 
612 
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:01,080 
Something that doesn't happen 
back in their native home, Asia, 
 
613 
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:03,560 
where predators 
keep their numbers in check. 
 
614 
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:09,400 
They've just exploded. 
This is a swarm of epic proportions. 
 
615 
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:13,080 
Look at the size of that one. 
 
616 
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:15,080 
That's got to be 30 pounds. 
 
617 
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,520 
If that hit you, it would 
break your jaw. 
 
618 
00:43:20,960 --> 00:43:24,200 
PEOPLE SHOUT 
 
619 
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,560 
And although this may all look 
a bit unconventional, 
 
620 
00:43:35,560 --> 00:43:39,160 
this event does play a small 
part in a serious attempt 
 
621 
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,800 
to control these fish. 
 
622 
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:47,960 
By the end of the event, 
 
623 
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,000 
over two tons of carp will have been 
cleared from the river. 
 
624 
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,720 
ALL CHEER 
 
625 
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:57,840 
And that's in addition to 
the hundreds of tons caught 
 
626 
00:43:57,840 --> 00:44:00,320 
every 
year through commercial fishing, 
 
627 
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:03,400 
some of which is actually now 
exported back as food 
 
628 
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:05,040 
to the carp's original home, Asia. 
 
629 
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,520 
But all this is just keeping 
things in check. 
 
630 
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:14,600 
It's not enough to actually defeat 
the swarm and stop it spreading... 
 
631 
00:44:17,640 --> 00:44:20,920 
Because a dangerous 
combination of unlimited food, 
 
632 
00:44:20,920 --> 00:44:25,920 
lots of space and freedom 
from predators allows some animals 
 
633 
00:44:25,920 --> 00:44:28,320 
to swarm to biblical proportions. 
 
634 
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:34,600 
And when swarms get to this scale, 
they also have a dark side. 
 
635 
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,560 
It doesn't take much to throw 
hundreds 
 
636 
00:44:39,560 --> 00:44:41,400 
of carp into mass confusion. 
 
637 
00:44:43,840 --> 00:44:47,920 
In seconds, 
fear passes from fish to fish... 
 
638 
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,800 
even though most of them 
won't know what they're afraid of. 
 
639 
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:58,280 
Because in a swarm, 
individuals are so closely connected 
 
640 
00:44:58,280 --> 00:45:00,200 
that they share moods and reactions. 
 
641 
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,520 
In the event of danger, a quick, 
united response like this 
 
642 
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:16,920 
can mean the difference 
between life or death. 
 
643 
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:22,560 
But, occasionally, 
the system goes wrong. 
 
644 
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:34,400 
An event sends a contagious 
emotion through the swarm 
 
645 
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:35,840 
and causes complete chaos. 
 
646 
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,200 
And, unfortunately, that's something 
you see in humans, too. 
 
647 
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:51,480 
CHEERING 
 
648 
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,320 
When thousands of strangers come 
together for a shared experience, 
 
649 
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:58,200 
it can create a powerful connection. 
 
650 
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:05,000 
When everything's going well, 
it can be an incredible experience. 
 
651 
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,120 
But when the mood changes, 
things can get very nasty. 
 
652 
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,600 
It takes just one event 
to cause a crowd 
 
653 
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,040 
to stampede like wildebeest... 
 
654 
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:17,760 
out of control 
and with dangerous consequences. 
 
655

SIREN BLARES 
 
656 
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,320 
Anger spreads person to person 
till a peaceful demonstration 
 
657 
00:46:24,320 --> 00:46:26,200 
becomes a full-blown mob. 
 
658 
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:30,920 
People stop thinking as individuals 
and begin to follow the herd. 
 
659 
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:36,800 
Emotions are high 
and behaviour starts to change. 
 
660 
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:41,080 
Within the group, people start 
losing their inhibitions. 
 
661 
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:44,280 
They do things they'd never consider 
doing if they were on their own. 
 
662 
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:48,760 
And because the group makes 
individuals feel powerful 
 
663 
00:46:48,760 --> 00:46:50,320 
and less accountable, 
 
664 
00:46:50,320 --> 00:46:54,120 
normally responsible people start 
acting completely out of character. 
 
665 
00:46:57,480 --> 00:46:59,120 
So, finding yourself in a crowd 
 
666 
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:01,760 
can play a huge role in how you 
behave as an individual. 
 
667 
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,760 
SIREN BLARES 
 
668 
00:47:05,440 --> 00:47:08,960 
Now, thankfully, most human 
gatherings pass without incident. 
 
669 
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,240 
But there is a swarm where big 
crowds are nearly always fatal. 
 
670 
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:22,440 
A plague of locusts is never 
a welcome sight for farmers. 
 
671 
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:28,360 
But when the numbers explode, 
it's also bad news for the swarm. 
 
672 
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:35,680 
At peak populations, the locusts 
suddenly start craving protein... 
 
673 
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:40,240 
..and the meat closest to hand is 
the insect ahead. 
 
674 
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:45,000 
To avoid being eaten 
alive by their nearest neighbours, 
 
675 
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,840 
the locusts need to keep moving. 
 
676 
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:51,560 
This cannibalistic swarm is not just 
tearing through the crops, 
 
677 
00:47:51,560 --> 00:47:54,600 
it's also at risk of devouring 
itself. 
 
678 
00:47:56,600 --> 00:48:00,960 
But overcrowding doesn't always 
work against the swarm. 
 
679 
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,280 
The animal I'm off to see next 
has turned 
 
680 
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:06,080 
overcrowding into its greatest 
asset. 
 
681 
00:48:11,800 --> 00:48:14,280 
This is a creature found in numbers 
so high, 
 
682 
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,920 
it brings people 
out into the streets. 
 
683 
00:48:18,520 --> 00:48:21,000 
To join them, I'm heading south. 
 
684 
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,560 
I'm in Texas, home to the largest 
gathering 
 
685 
00:48:32,560 --> 00:48:34,440 
of mammals anywhere on the planet. 
 
686 
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:39,720 
Every summer, 
as night falls in Austin, Texas, 
 
687 
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:42,280 
a seemingly endless swarm 
fills the air. 
 
688 
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:49,240 
Wow! Look at this. They're just like 
flooding out of the bridge right now. 
 
689 
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:58,120 
Wow! Look back into the distance, 
guys. 
 
690 
00:48:58,120 --> 00:48:59,880 
It almost looks like a plume 
of smoke. 
 
691 
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,480 
The residents are outnumbered. 
 
692 
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,480 
Over a million creatures 
are swarming the skies. 
 
693 
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:17,880 
This bridge is the biggest 
urban roost 
 
694 
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:21,200 
for Mexican free-tailed bats 
anywhere in the world. 
 
695 
00:49:23,160 --> 00:49:25,360 
Oh, look at this. Look at this. 
 
696 
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:26,920 
This has become a real spectacle. 
 
697 
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,880 
There's just 
hundreds of thousands of bats 
 
698 
00:49:32,880 --> 00:49:35,240 
and they're streaming 
out from under the bridge. 
 
699 
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,760 
This is a colony of biblical 
proportions. 
 
700 
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:46,520 
So what do the bright lights of 
the city have to offer these bats? 
 
701 
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,160 
Like many riverside cities, 
 
702 
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,760 
there's a glut of insects 
in the summer months. 
 
703 
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:57,040 
But what really makes Austin 
a bat hotspot is its architecture. 
 
704 
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,400 
When Congress Bridge 
was rebuilt in the '80s, 
 
705 
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:04,600 
the new structure was full of deep, 
narrow openings. 
 
706 
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:11,680 
It was the ideal bat home 
and they moved in en masse, 
 
707 
00:50:11,680 --> 00:50:14,960 
but this convenient city pad 
isn't without problems. 
 
708 
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:22,120 
Space is limited and the bats 
are an easy target 
 
709 
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:25,960 
for birds of prey 
and other predators. 
 
710 
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:56,200 
So, as impressive as this is, 
 
711 
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:01,240 
a three-hour drive away, there's 
a bat swarm ten times bigger. 
 
712 
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:10,400 
And a swarm of this size can achieve 
the seemingly impossible. 
 
713 
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:19,320 
But getting a good view of it 
isn't going to be easy. 
 
714 
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:24,640 
This area of Texas is 
riddled with caves, 
 
715 
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,040 
making it the perfect 
habitat for bats. 
 
716 
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,760 
The caves offer them protection from 
the elements and from aerial attack. 
 
717 
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,400 
But to find the real reason 
 
718 
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,440 
ten million bats flock to this 
particular cave... 
 
719 
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,480 
I need to get much 
closer to the swarm. 
 
720 
00:51:45,120 --> 00:51:48,400 
This isn't going to be 
a pleasant journey. 
 
721 
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,200 
I'm now entering 
one of the most overcrowded 
 
722 
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,880 
and toxic places on Earth. 
 
723 
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,400 
So, I've come prepared. 
 
724 
00:52:00,760 --> 00:52:03,000 
Wow. The smell. 
 
725 
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:06,200 
Ammonia is actually quite intense. 
 
726 
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,960 
The caves are piled high with bat 
droppings, guano, 
 
727 
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,400 
releasing dangerously high 
levels of poisonous gases. 
 
728 
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:22,680 
Levels of ammonia are so high 
that it bleaches the bats' fur. 
 
729 
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:28,200 
But, amazingly, 
the bats themselves aren't harmed. 
 
730 
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,080 
By slowing down their metabolism, 
 
731 
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,000 
their bodies are able to 
neutralise the toxic gas. 
 
732 
00:52:40,040 --> 00:52:42,800 
This pile of guano is 
absolutely enormous - 
 
733 
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:45,760 
it must be metres thick. 
 
734 
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:49,400 
That roof is absolutely jam-packed 
with bats and look at them. 
 
735 
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:52,840 
It's every crevice. 
 
736 
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,960 
There's a big group of them 
right here. 
 
737 
00:52:57,640 --> 00:53:01,360 
The levels of ammonia are now 
potentially fatal 
 
738 
00:53:01,360 --> 00:53:05,360 
and, without these masks, we'd be 
unconscious in a matter of minutes. 
 
739 
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:10,840 
Very little can survive these 
lethal conditions... 
 
740 
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:12,480 
apart from the bats, that is. 
 
741 
00:53:14,320 --> 00:53:17,960 
If you're wondering what a million 
bats look like, it looks like this. 
 
742 
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:21,160 
This is one of the most incredible 
sights I think I've ever seen. 
 
743 
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,080 
This is a giant bat creche. 
 
744 
00:53:31,840 --> 00:53:35,000 
Every year, ten million pregnant 
female bats 
 
745 
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:37,280 
fly to these caves to give birth. 
 
746 
00:53:39,080 --> 00:53:43,720 
It's more or less predator-free down 
here, thanks to the deadly fumes, 
 
747 
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,400 
so it's a safe place for mothers 
to leave their young 
 
748 
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:47,920 
while they go off and hunt. 
 
749 
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:52,040 
The really amazing thing about these 
bats is, 
 
750 
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:55,480 
the adult females roost 
in a different part of the cave. 
 
751 
00:53:55,480 --> 00:53:58,000 
These are just the young 
and so to feed them, 
 
752 
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,680 
they have to actually find their own 
individual flock 
 
753 
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,200 
in amongst this lot. 
 
754 
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:05,680 
Just imagine you having to find 
your baby 
 
755 
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,280 
in among a million other 
close-packed babies. 
 
756 
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,800 
It's just unbelievable. 
 
757 
00:54:13,880 --> 00:54:15,760 
But there's something even 
smarter 
 
758 
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,800 
about how these baby 
bats are organised. 
 
759 
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:24,160 
They're crammed in at over 4,000 
bats per square metre, 
 
760 
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,440 
and it's this incredible density 
of animals that holds the key 
 
761 
00:54:28,440 --> 00:54:30,480 
to their success. 
 
762 
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:33,720 
I've brought a thermal imaging 
camera, which will show us 
 
763 
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:36,600 
which parts of the cave are hot. 
 
764 
00:54:36,600 --> 00:54:39,120 
So, if I pan the thermal image 
camera across the roof, 
 
765 
00:54:39,120 --> 00:54:41,240 
you can see it's not very hot. 
 
766 
00:54:41,240 --> 00:54:44,720 
And then when I get 
to the roof - look at that. 
 
767 
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:48,360 
Red is hot and white is even hotter. 
 
768 
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:53,400 
These young bats are in a roost that is probably 20 degrees hotter 
 
769 
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:54,840 
than the rest of the cave, 
 
770 
00:54:54,840 --> 00:54:58,640 
which means that they're able to grow at a phenomenal rate, 
 
771 
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:00,520 
making it the perfect incubator. 
 
772 
00:55:01,960 --> 00:55:05,120 
The whole secret to this animal's success 
 
773 
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:07,760 
is the fact that it is part of a swarm. 
 
774 
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,840 
On their own, they wouldn't survive. 
 
775 
00:55:11,720 --> 00:55:15,360 
Not only have the bats created a hostile environment 
 
776 
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,520 
that few others can survive in, 
 
777 
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:19,680 
their real genius is that, 
 
778 
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,440 
by filling it with millions of individuals, 
 
779 
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:25,600 
they've even managed to change conditions in the cave 
 
780 
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:26,680 
to suit the swarm. 
 
781 
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,840 
Well, this may be the perfect environment for rearing bats, 
 
782 
00:55:30,840 --> 00:55:34,720 
but it's definitely not the perfect environment for humans. 
 
783 
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:38,480 
If I stay here much longer it could be fatal, so I'm off. 
 
784 
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:46,280 
By now, the bats have started their nightly exodus to feed. 
 
785 
00:55:54,320 --> 00:55:57,400 
And for me, the only way back out of the cave is right through 
 
786 
00:55:57,400 --> 00:55:59,320 
the eye of this gigantic bat swarm. 
 
787 
00:56:02,720 --> 00:56:06,760 
There's literally tens, if not hundreds of thousands of them. 
 
788 
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:10,640 
I've never seen so many bats in one place in my life. 
 
789 
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:15,440 
This is the start of a ten million-strong swarm 
 
790 
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:19,360 
that will fly around and out of this cave for the next three hours. 
 
791 
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:32,840 
Surprisingly, these Mexican free-tailed bats are not very agile. 
 
792 
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:35,480 
They're not particularly manoeuvrable bats. 
 
793 
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,400 
Being tucked down in these caves 
 
794 
00:56:40,400 --> 00:56:44,120 
means the bats have to commute long distances for food, 
 
795 
00:56:44,120 --> 00:56:46,880 
so these are the speedy cross-country fliers 
 
796 
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:48,000 
of the bat world. 
 
797 
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,880 
Having to deal with some obstacles is a bit more of a challenge. 
 
798 
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:55,720 
Argh! Argh! 
 
799 
00:56:55,720 --> 00:56:58,520 
Oh! Oh! 
 
800 
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,080 
This getting quite intense now. 
 
801 
00:57:03,080 --> 00:57:04,640 
Argh! 
 
802 
00:57:04,640 --> 00:57:06,240 
That was on my beard, that one. 
 
803 
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,600 
I'm being absolutely bombarded by bats. 
 
804 
00:57:17,880 --> 00:57:22,120 
This would be some people's worst nightmare 
 
805 
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:25,200 
but, for me, to be inside in the eye of this swarm of bats 
 
806 
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:27,600 
is just the most thrilling experience. 
 
807 
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:39,800 
These bats are the ultimate opportunists. 
 
808 
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,080 
By swarming together, 
 
809 
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:44,480 
they're able to make their home where most others would fail... 
 
810 
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,360 
proving there are huge benefits to life in the swarm. 
 
811 
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:56,520 
Swarms are a way for animals 
 
812 
00:57:56,520 --> 00:57:59,280 
to become significantly more successful. 
 
813 
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:04,640 
In working together, swarms become cleverer, stronger, 
 
814 
00:58:04,640 --> 00:58:07,720 
and individuals are much more likely to survive. 
 
815 
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:15,040 
Understanding swarms is now also shedding light on how humans behave. 
 
816 
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:20,840 
With urban populations expected to double in the next 40 years... 
 
817 
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:25,360 
we're all going to have to get used to living amongst the crowd. 
 
818 
00:58:28,160 --> 00:58:32,160 
Unlocking the secrets of the swarm could become critical.
