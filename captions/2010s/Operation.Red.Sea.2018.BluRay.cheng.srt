00:14:09,752 --> 00:14:11,992
一间能源公司的开发部主管
His department works on

164
00:14:12,632 --> 00:14:15,692
他的部门负责开采铀的业务
the mining of uranium

165
00:14:15,762 --> 00:14:18,812
还有在外地采购黄饼[核原料]的工作
and obtaining "yellow cake" in foreign countries.

166
00:14:18,942 --> 00:14:21,032
怪不得我们一直想不通
That's why we couldn't figure out

167
00:14:21,082 --> 00:14:23,002
黄饼的来源
where the "yellow cake" came from.

168
00:14:24,992 --> 00:14:26,622
2014年10月
October, 2014.

169
00:14:26,762 --> 00:14:28,412
他被调查的时间
The month he was investigated.

170
00:14:28,442 --> 00:14:29,792
不就和那批没记名的黄饼
That was the same time

171
00:14:29,842 --> 00:14:31,532
被偷运的时间一样？
the unmarked "yellow cake" was smuggled in.

172
00:14:31,602 --> 00:14:32,652
就是嘛
Exactly.

173
00:14:33,022 --> 00:14:34,182
线人说
My guy says

174
00:14:34,242 --> 00:14:38,262
威廉手上仍有一批数量不少的黄饼
that William still has access to an abundant amount of "yellow cake".

175
00:14:38,632 --> 00:14:40,472
他刚得到
And he has

176
00:14:40,552 --> 00:14:43,292
制造脏弹[核污染炸弹]的技术
just acquired the technology to make 30 bombs.

177
00:14:47,402 --> 00:14:49,352
现在伊维亚的局势这样紧张
The situation in Yewaire is tense.

178
00:14:49,412 --> 00:14:51,302
如果那批黄饼仍在那里的话
If that "yellow cake" is still there,

179
00:14:51,362 --> 00:14:54,042
他很有可能会尽快交易并把黄饼运走
he wants to finish the deal and get rid of it.

180
00:14:54,112 --> 00:14:55,882
我们一定要跟着这条线
We must follow this lead.

181
00:14:56,252 --> 00:14:58,332
关于威廉还有另外一个新闻
There is another report on William

182
00:14:58,422 --> 00:15:01,872
有一个少女之前遭到性虐待
about a sexual abuse case of a young girl.

183
00:15:02,682 --> 00:15:04,922
所有的证据都直指威廉
Okay? And all evidence points to him.

184
00:15:05,112 --> 00:15:06,882
线人接触过她
My guy talked to the girl and she said

185
00:15:07,002 --> 00:15:10,512
她提到威廉从来不会脱下脖子上的项链
William never took off his necklace

186
00:15:10,562 --> 00:15:13,162
因为他说里面有一个
because he said it contains a secret

187
00:15:13,242 --> 00:15:16,352
可以让世界大乱的秘密
that would turn the world into chaos.

188
00:15:21,802 --> 00:15:22,912
我查到了
I've got it.

189
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:24,122
我马上就飞一趟
I'm going straight there.

190
00:15:24,202 --> 00:15:25,242
但同时明天一早
And tomorrow morning,

191
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:27,342
我会让阿布出一整版的报料
Abu will publish a full-page report.

192
00:15:27,402 --> 00:15:29,352
看看能不能延缓一下他们的行动
Let's do something to sabotage their plan.

193
00:15:29,652 --> 00:15:31,152
这件事你别再跟进了
Don't take this any further.

194
00:15:32,002 --> 00:15:33,192
你也知道
You already know

195
00:15:33,702 --> 00:15:35,132
现在恐怖分子对你不利
the terrorists are onto you.

196
00:15:35,172 --> 00:15:36,342
那又怎样？
So what?

197
00:15:38,002 --> 00:15:40,082
现在不是刺你几刀的问题
It's not about scaring you,

198
00:15:40,842 --> 00:15:43,072
也不是你个人怕不怕的问题
nor it is about you being scared.

199
00:15:45,932 --> 00:15:47,872
Albert 你应该比谁都清楚
Albert, you know better than anyone

200
00:15:48,122 --> 00:15:50,162
我为什么离开之前那几家大的报社
why I left those big newspapers.

201
00:15:50,202 --> 00:15:52,322
不就是因为他们总是选择性的报导吗？
It's because they always do selective reporting

202
00:15:52,632 --> 00:15:54,472
到最后总是掩盖事实真相
and covered up the truth!

203
00:15:54,572 --> 00:15:56,652
- 而我记得你找我来 你跟我说过 - 不
- When you hired me, you said-- - No!

204
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:58,902
- 你需要一个敢于走近真相的人 - 不
- I have the guts to go expose the truth. - No!

205
00:15:58,942 --> 00:16:00,132
- 所以我来了 - 不 不
- That's why I'm here! - No!

206
00:16:01,682 --> 00:16:03,182
我欣赏你的拼劲
I appreciate your tenacity,

207
00:16:03,972 --> 00:16:05,792
但是凡事总有一个限度
but there are limits.

208
00:16:06,222 --> 00:16:09,542
你自己曾经坚持和相信的是不是已经忘了？
Did you forget what you stand for?

209
00:16:10,392 --> 00:16:14,682
"如果你的照片不够好 那表示你还离得不够近"

210
00:16:50,682 --> 00:16:54,552
我绝对不容许我再有员工有生命危险
<i>I definitely won't risk the lives of my staff!</i>

211
00:16:59,762 --> 00:17:01,912
总有一些东西比生命更重要
But there are things that are more important than life.

212
00:17:10,622 --> 00:17:12,452
今天凌晨3点43分

00:45:32,022 --> 00:45:33,672
我们这次行动的决心

00:45:33,862 --> 00:45:35,882
就是要让恐怖组织知道
<i>is to give a message to all terrorists</i>

539
00:45:55,302 --> 00:45:57,702
刚才他求我救他孩子的时候

540
00:45:58,202 --> 00:45:59,662
我心里很难受
I felt awful.

00:46:00,842 --> 00:46:01,892
人救了
We saved their lives,

542
00:46:03,002 --> 00:46:04,172
可是家没了
but not their homes.

543

他们这个国家
This country of theirs

544
00:46:07,632 --> 00:46:09,102
已经乱成这样了

我们顶多就是把任务完成

546
00:46:13,332 --> 00:46:14,742
别的什么也做不了
and that's it.

547
00:46:19,482 --> 00:46:21,042
你为什么总爱吃糖？
Why do you like candy so much?

548
00:46:21,962 --> 00:46:24,272
看你认识我这么多年 不知道吧？
You still don't know after all this time?

549
00:46:24,622 --> 00:46:25,992
我小时候特别调皮
I was a naughty kid.

550
00:46:26,092 --> 00:46:27,152
总被妈妈打
I always got spanked.

551

打我一次呢
But each time,

552

就给我一块糖吃
my mom gave me a candy.

553
00:46:30,122 --> 00:46:31,302
所以说到现在
So even now,

554
00:46:31,362 --> 00:46:32,212
一出任务
when I'm on a mission,

555
00:46:32,272 --> 00:46:33,092
只要有糖吃
if I have candy,

556
00:46:33,152 --> 00:46:34,442
什么事儿都没了
I can handle anything.

557
00:46:37,872 --> 00:46:39,232
打我干嘛？
What was that for?

558
00:46:39,782 --> 00:46:40,942
不是说吃糖…
Didn't you say

559
00:46:41,022 --> 00:46:42,932
不是说吃糖不疼吗？
if you have candy, there is no pain?

560
00:46:51,102 --> 00:46:53,912
你知不知道我跟罗星有一场比赛要打？
Do you know Xing Luo and I were rivals?

561
00:46:54,182 --> 00:46:55,032
知道
Yes.

562
00:46:56,062 --> 00:46:58,042
你们要争委内瑞拉特种兵学校

563
00:46:58,102 --> 00:47:00,432

564
00:47:01,212 --> 00:47:02,972
全蛟龙只有一个名额
There's only one spot for Jiaolong.

565
00:47:04,772 --> 00:47:05,842
可惜
It's a pity.

566
00:47:06,212 --> 00:47:07,712
没机会跟他比一场
There is no chance to compete now.

567
00:47:08,622 --> 00:47:10,922
他是我见过最好的狙击手
He was the best sniper I ever saw.

568
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:14,842
你以前也这样吗？
Were you always like this?

569
00:47:16,202 --> 00:47:17,042
哪样？
Like what?

570

紧张
Tense.

571
00:47:18,432 --> 00:47:19,922
抗压能力太差
Shaky under pressure.

572
00:47:23,252 --> 00:47:24,432
战场上
On the battlefield,

573
00:47:24,602 --> 00:47:25,872
子弹躲不掉的
you can't dodge bullets.

这一课
Take this

575
00:47:27,292 --> 00:47:28,772
算哥送给你的
as a free lesson for you.

576

我就是担心他们赶不回来
I worry they won't get back in time.

但是到目前为止
But we don't have

我明白 但是我必须要去巴塞姆镇

因为我除了要救我的助手以外

赶紧催一下他们出发 快一点
get them moving. Quick.

636
00:50:50,052 --> 00:50:52,992
我其实一直在追查黑市核原料黄饼的买卖
It's about the black-market "yellow cake".

637
00:50:53,112 --> 00:50:55,002
被恐怖分子抓走的那个威廉
Zaka has William Parsons,

638
00:50:55,062 --> 00:50:56,302
是其中最大的卖家
the biggest dealer in the market.

639
00:50:56,392 --> 00:50:57,362
最近我们发现
We found out

640
00:50:57,422 --> 00:50:59,252
他跟一些恐怖组织接触密切
that he's in touch with terrorist groups.

641
00:50:59,342 --> 00:51:00,162
其中一个组织

已经拥有提高黄饼放射量的技术

644
00:51:05,082 --> 00:51:06,042
也就是说
Which means

645
00:51:06,112 --> 00:51:07,692
黄饼一旦落到他们的手里
once they get the "yellow cake",

646
00:51:07,742 --> 00:51:09,202
下一次恐怖袭击会死多少人
who knows how many

647
00:51:09,242 --> 00:51:10,532
我们无法预估
they will kill?

648
00:51:10,612 --> 00:51:11,882
你说的组织是扎卡 对吗？
Are you talking about Zaka?

649
00:51:11,932 --> 00:51:13,892
扎卡只是想要抢走威廉手上的黄饼
Yes, all they want is the "yellow cake".

650
00:51:13,952 --> 00:51:15,912
- 我们不管那是什么组织 - 而我是希望你们能把阿布
- It's not our business. - I hope you can save Abu,

你不可以跟我们参与这次行动

00:51:29,492 --> 00:51:31,402
我没有办法拿到我要的东西
I'll never get what I came for!

00:51:36,352 --> 00:51:37,672
我为什么不能离开？
Why not?

00:51:37,722 --> 00:51:38,872
我刚刚跟你讲过很多遍了
I already told you.

上级给我们的指示
We were ordered

665
00:51:40,312 --> 00:51:42,522
是要把你安全护送到政府军沿途的基地

666
00:51:42,572 --> 00:51:44,362
再由政府军统一安排你们执行撤离
You'll be evacuated from there.

667
00:51:44,412 --> 00:51:45,322
首长您好 我是夏楠

00:51:45,352 --> 00:51:46,402
- 我想向您汇报一个情况 - 夏小姐…

怎么了？
What is it?

673

扎卡给政府军发了一段视频

674
00:52:03,532 --> 00:52:05,062
标明是给中国海军的

你看一下
Look.

676
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,692
秘书长莫哈迪罪孽深重
<i>Chief Secretary Muhadi is a sinner</i>

677
00:52:10,792 --> 00:52:12,662
迫害自由的我族人民

678
00:52:12,712 --> 00:52:14,582
滥用武力

马上交出莫哈迪的家人

681
00:52:19,672 --> 00:52:22,022
我们必须为遭受莫哈迪迫害

682
00:52:22,092 --> 00:52:24,442
而牺牲的兄弟姐妹报仇

683
00:52:24,482 --> 00:52:26,012
否则
<i>If you refuse to cooperate,</i>

684
00:52:26,102 --> 00:52:29,962
中国公民将代替他们接受惩罚
<i>the Chinese citizens shall take the punishment in their place.</i>

685
00:52:30,082 --> 00:52:32,002
我现在就给你们一个示范

686
00:52:35,832 --> 00:52:38,662
下一个就是这中国女人
<i>And this Chinese woman will be next.</i>

687
00:52:44,182 --> 00:52:45,942

795
01:07:24,042 --> 01:07:25,022
使劲
Pull!

796
01:07:25,932 --> 01:07:27,022
使劲
Harder!

797
01:07:27,652 --> 01:07:29,932
有没有事？怎么样？怎么样？
Are you okay?

798
01:07:52,762 --> 01:07:54,702
我们距离目的地还有80公里
We're 80 kilometers from our target.

799
01:07:54,982 --> 01:07:57,422
但是军舰离港的时间只剩下一个半小时
But the ship sails in 90 minutes.

800
01:07:57,722 --> 01:07:59,382
我们只有一辆狐式装甲可以用
We only have one vehicle left

801
01:07:59,432 --> 01:08:00,832
还正在抢修当中
<i>and that's under repair.</i>

802
01:08:01,082 --> 01:08:02,492
我们可能赶不回去了
We won't make it back in time.

803
01:08:02,762 --> 01:08:04,972
他们政府军有没有其他的办法来保障我们？
Can their troops give us more support?

804
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:09,582
上级已经向伊维亚政府提出了要求
Our superiors put in a request,

805
01:08:09,992 --> 01:08:13,102
但是对方表示现在还不能调动增援
but they've no troops to spare.

806
01:08:13,472 --> 01:08:15,932
只能提供他们的一个支援点
They can only get us out at a point

807
01:08:16,262 --> 01:08:18,802
在离目标以北60公里的地方
<i>60 kilometers north of the target.</i>

808
01:08:19,362 --> 01:08:20,772
你们营救成功后
<i>After the rescue,</i>

809
01:08:20,832 --> 01:08:22,232
可以先撤到那里
go straight there.

810
01:08:23,142 --> 01:08:27,582
但是支援点和目标之间是一段高危地带
But it's a very dangerous route.

811
01:08:28,202 --> 01:08:30,582
撤离的时候必须要小心
You need to be on high alert.

812
01:08:30,742 --> 01:08:31,622
是
<i>Roger that!</i>

813
01:08:31,762 --> 01:08:35,062
另外 扎卡发了一段视频
<i>Also, Zaka released a video.</i>

814
01:08:35,702 --> 01:08:38,202
他们把那个记者助理的头给砍了
They beheaded the reporter's assistant.

815
01:09:45,012 --> 01:09:46,742
我做过这么多演习
Despite all those drills

816
01:09:48,052 --> 01:09:49,102
训练
and training,

817
01:09:52,312 --> 01:09:54,302
没想过遇到这种情况
l never thought

818
01:09:55,912 --> 01:09:57,722
完全控制不了自己
I'd lose control like that.

819
01:10:02,832 --> 01:10:03,982
副队
Sir.

820
01:10:05,462 --> 01:10:07,342
我没资格当蛟龙
I'm not good enough for Jiaolong.

821
01:10:11,302 --> 01:10:13,882
你还记得我们是怎么成为蛟龙的吗？
Do you remember how we became a team?

822
01:10:17,572 --> 01:10:19,722
我们经历过多少困难
We went through tough times.

823
01:10:20,112 --> 01:10:22,262
想过多少次放弃
We were all tempted to quit,

824
01:10:23,642 --> 01:10:26,022
可还是坚持下来了 对吧？
but we held on, right?

825
01:10:28,372 --> 01:10:29,742
能站在这儿
The fact that we are here now

826
01:10:29,962 --> 01:10:32,822
就说明我们每一个人都是合格的
proves we are all qualified.

827
01:10:35,382 --> 01:10:37,162
想想我们的口号
Think of our motto.

828
01:10:44,012 --> 01:10:45,742
"强者无敌"
"Conquer fear, conquer all."

829
01:11:19,212 --> 01:11:21,102
刚刚表现很好
You did well just now.

830
01:11:24,392 --> 01:11:26,112
我不是表现给你看的
It wasn't for show.

831
01:11:29,132 --> 01:11:30,252
我看到了
Well, I saw it.

832
01:11:42,602 --> 01:11:43,802
还疼吗？
Does it hurt?

833
01:11:44,932 --> 01:11:46,042
有一点儿
A little.

834
01:12:00,662 --> 01:12:02,142
别想多了
Don't think too much.

835
01:12:19,402 --> 01:12:21,462
你可以跟我们一起去巴塞姆镇
You can come to Basem with us.

836
01:12:22,742 --> 01:12:25,162
有支援了是吗？什么时候到？
Are we getting reinforcements? When?

837
01:12:28,862 --> 01:12:30,222
我要跟你讲的是
Listen.

838
01:12:31,052 --> 01:12:32,342
既然跟我们一起走
If you come with us,

839
01:12:32,432 --> 01:12:33,982
请你服从我们的命令 好吗？
you have to follow orders, okay?

840
01:12:34,042 --> 01:12:34,832
杨队长 我提醒你
Captain, let me tell you.

841
01:12:34,872 --> 01:12:36,012
如果你的支援不到的话
Without reinforcements,

842
01:12:36,072 --> 01:12:36,822
你不要轻易走
you have to be really careful.

843
01:12:36,872 --> 01:12:38,162
因为这个路程一个多小时
It's more than an hour away.

844
01:12:38,192 --> 01:12:39,242
你们的车能修好吗？
Can you fix the vehicle?

845
01:12:39,292 --> 01:12:41,422
车 我们正在全力的抢修
We're doing our best.

846
01:12:41,612 --> 01:12:43,062
这个东西不用你来操心
That's none of your concern.

847
01:12:43,102 --> 01:12:45,062
我要跟你讲的是命令的问题
I'm talking about the orders.

848
01:12:45,622 --> 01:12:46,442
就是
It's about

849
01:12:47,362 --> 01:12:48,572
刚才的战斗
the battle just now.

850
01:12:48,872 --> 01:12:50,382
我跟你强调了原地别动
I told you to stay put.

851
01:12:50,452 --> 01:12:52,302
是 我理解你是为了救人 对吧？
Sure, it was to save a life.

852
01:12:52,342 --> 01:12:54,662
但是我希望的是在下面的行动当中
But when there is action next time,

853
01:12:54,942 --> 01:12:56,012
因为情况非常危险
considering the danger,

854
01:12:56,082 --> 01:12:58,302
所以无论发生什么样的情况
no matter what happens,

855
01:12:58,892 --> 01:13:01,262
请你能够百分之百的服从我们的命令
you do exactly as we say.

856
01:13:01,322 --> 01:13:03,532
- 好… - 如果你的命令下错呢？
- Okay? - What if the order is wrong?

857
01:13:04,632 --> 01:13:06,862
你怎么能保证你下的命令是对的？
How do you know it's right?

858
01:13:07,322 --> 01:13:08,702
对 我们的身份是不一样
Yes, we have different roles,

859
01:13:08,762 --> 01:13:09,582
但是我们的信念未必…
but as for our beliefs--

860
01:13:09,632 --> 01:13:12,142
如果我的命令下错了 我自己负责
If I'm wrong, I take responsibility!

861
01:13:12,362 --> 01:13:14,262
但如果你不服从命令 你死了
But if you disobey and you die,

862
01:13:14,322 --> 01:13:15,302
请问谁来负责？
who will be responsible then?

863
01:13:15,352 --> 01:13:16,582
如果的话…
If that's the case,

864
01:13:17,742 --> 01:13:19,262
千万别救我
then don't save me.

865
01:13:21,032 --> 01:13:23,812
报告队长 车好了 马上到
<i>Captain, the vehicle has been fixed.</i> <i>Will be right there.</i>

Sayyid 威廉现在情况怎样？
<i>Sayyid, how is Dr. William?</i>

869
01:13:42,522 --> 01:13:46,412
人没事 不过还没醒来
<i>He is alive.</i> But still unconscious.

870
01:13:48,142 --> 01:13:52,402
除了黄饼
<i>Besides the "yellow cake",</i>

871
01:13:53,722 --> 01:13:57,822
一定要问出脏弹技术在哪里
<i>we need the formula for the dirty bomb.</i>

872
01:13:58,912 --> 01:14:00,172
明白吗？
<i>Understand?</i>

873
01:14:00,862 --> 01:14:02,462
明白 先生
Yes.

874
01:14:47,942 --> 01:14:48,832
庄羽 庄羽

01:14:48,892 --> 01:14:50,002
找一处高地
Find a high place.

876
01:14:50,102 --> 01:14:51,262
架上卫星天线
Set up an antenna.

877

保持和舰上的联系
Keep contact with base.

收到
<i>Roger that.</i>

879

测试 测试
Testing, testing.

880
01:15:41,492 --> 01:15:43,812
不要害怕
Don't be scared.

881
01:15:44,122 --> 01:15:49,552
他们是中国军人 是来救人的
The Chinese Navy is here to rescue people.

882
01:15:49,642 --> 01:15:51,072
不要害怕
Don't be scared.

883
01:15:56,452 --> 01:15:57,732
这个屋子的主人贝拉说
The house owner, Bella,

884
01:15:57,772 --> 01:15:59,852
一个星期前这里就被恐怖分子占领了
says they came a week ago,

885
01:15:59,942 --> 01:16:01,092
把所有的男人都杀了
killed all the men,

886
01:16:01,152 --> 01:16:02,302
把妇女和孩子都赶走
chased off the others,

887
01:16:02,362 --> 01:16:03,752
只留下她们几个给他们做饭
and kept them hereto cook.

888
01:16:03,802 --> 01:16:04,652
现在镇子上
In the town now,

889
01:16:04,682 --> 01:16:06,652
恐怖分子大概有150个人左右
there are about 150 terrorists.

890
01:16:06,712 --> 01:16:08,302
主要集中在广场附近活动
They stay around the square.

891
01:16:08,362 --> 01:16:09,742
她画了一张图
She drew a map.

892
01:16:11,252 --> 01:16:13,502
这是恐怖分子的指挥中心 在这儿
This is their headquarters.

893
01:16:13,882 --> 01:16:15,882
这个广场北边 就是人质营
The hostage camp is to the north.

894
01:16:15,952 --> 01:16:16,982
十几个人把守
They have about ten guards

895
01:16:17,042 --> 01:16:18,792
里面现在有25个人质
and 25 hostages in there.

896
01:16:18,942 --> 01:16:20,102
除了五个政府军以外
They are all foreigners

897
01:16:20,142 --> 01:16:21,382
其他全部是外籍
except for five soldiers.

898
01:16:21,532 --> 01:16:23,302
三个女性只有一个是亚洲女性
There are three women, one of them is Asian.

899
01:16:23,362 --> 01:16:25,152
按她的描述应该就是邓梅
Her description matches Mei Deng's.

900
01:16:25,302 --> 01:16:26,142
等一下
Hold on.

901
01:16:26,322 --> 01:16:28,422
有多少条路通往这个人质营？
How can we access the camp?

902
01:16:31,822 --> 01:16:33,262
只有广场一条
Only through the square.

903
01:16:34,452 --> 01:16:36,232
先把我们这个情况跟舰上汇报一下
Send a situation report to the ship.

904
01:16:36,282 --> 01:16:37,312
是
Yes, sir.

905
01:16:41,392 --> 01:16:43,002
8对150
It's eight against 150 people.

906
01:16:43,552 --> 01:16:45,102
你们以前有过这样的经验吗？
Have you ever done anything like this before?

907
01:16:45,162 --> 01:16:46,142
我们这八个人的任务
Our unit's mission

908
01:16:46,182 --> 01:16:47,922
不是要解决那150个人
is not to deal with those 150 people.

909
01:16:48,502 --> 01:16:51,352
而是去营救那个必须去营救的中国人质
It's to rescue the Chinese hostage.

910
01:16:55,962 --> 01:16:58,512
就是说其他的人还是没有希望了
So is there no hope for the others?

911
01:17:00,062 --> 01:17:01,352
没时间了
There's no time.

912
01:17:05,152 --> 01:17:06,982
那…有没有可能
Is it possible

913
01:17:07,512 --> 01:17:09,292
如果你们可以的话
for you

914
01:17:09,672 --> 01:17:11,132
再多救一个人？
to save one more person?

915
01:17:11,192 --> 01:17:12,872
有没有这种可能？
Is there any chance of that?

916
01:17:18,242 --> 01:17:20,102
你的助手阿布
Your assistant, Abu

917
01:17:21,262 --> 01:17:22,982
已经被他们处决了
has been executed.

918
01:17:31,272 --> 01:17:32,782
什么时候的事？
When did that happened?

919
01:17:33,152 --> 01:17:34,472
我们来之前
Before we got here.

920
01:18:13,032 --> 01:18:14,232
我的先生和我的孩子
My husband and child

921
01:18:14,272 --> 01:18:16,462
也是死在像今天这样的大巴上
died on a bus just like today.

922
01:18:26,042 --> 01:18:27,412
在零五年…
<i>In 2005,</i>

923
01:18:28,732 --> 01:18:31,302
零五年伦敦炸弹袭击的时候
<i>when they blew up the bus in London.</i>

924
01:18:35,062 --> 01:18:37,142
警察找到我跟我说
The police told me

925
01:18:38,322 --> 01:18:40,182
什么都没有剩下
that nothing was left of them,

926
01:18:43,192 --> 01:18:45,832
只有一个小小的蓝色的手链
but a little blue bracelet.

927
01:18:50,402 --> 01:18:51,662
从那以后
That's when

928
01:18:52,392 --> 01:18:54,182
我就要跟他们干到底
I vowed to fight against them to the end.

929
01:18:55,072 --> 01:18:56,782
我要跟恐怖组织干到底
To fight against the terrorist groups.

930
01:18:56,942 --> 01:18:58,502
我什么都不怕
I'm not afraid of anything,

931
01:18:59,002 --> 01:19:00,822
我连死都不怕
even death.

932
01:19:01,902 --> 01:19:04,302
我就是怕像今天这样没有办法
I'm only afraid of being powerless to help.

933
01:19:06,952 --> 01:19:08,982
其实我谁都保护不了
I've failed to protect anyone.

934
01:19:10,192 --> 01:19:12,782
其实我连阿布都保护不了
Not even Abu. I've failed to protect him.

935
01:19:12,872 --> 01:19:14,422
我谁都…
I've failed.

936
01:19:20,802 --> 01:19:21,642
舰长说
The captain says,

937
01:19:21,702 --> 01:19:22,662
唯一的支援
the only support

938
01:19:22,732 --> 01:19:25,352
是政府军可以安排直升机协助我们撤离
will be a chopper for evacuation,

939
01:19:25,462 --> 01:19:27,002
但是没有具体时间
but they can't say when.

940
01:19:29,592 --> 01:19:30,732
除了邓梅之外
In addition to Mei Deng,

941
01:19:31,142 --> 01:19:33,412
我想把其他的人质全都救下来
I want to rescue the others too.

942
01:19:34,732 --> 01:19:36,062
你有什么方案？
Do you have a strategy?

943
01:19:40,272 --> 01:19:41,982
如果要救那么多人走的话
With so many people,

944
01:19:42,362 --> 01:19:43,742
就不可能原路返回了
we can't take that road back.

945
01:19:44,032 --> 01:19:44,902
不如干脆
It's better

946
01:19:45,002 --> 01:19:47,242
直接带所有人穿过人质营北面的沙漠
to go north through the desert,

947
01:19:47,322 --> 01:19:48,262
去政府军基地
straight to the army base.

948
01:19:48,322 --> 01:19:49,022
但问题是
The problem is

949
01:19:49,082 --> 01:19:51,102
目标太大 敌人一旦追上来的话…
we'll be exposed if they started to chase us.

950
01:19:51,402 --> 01:19:52,742
邓梅还是首要任务
Mei Deng is the priority.

951
01:19:52,862 --> 01:19:55,082
等邓梅安全撤离原路返回之后
Once she's safely out,

952
01:19:55,312 --> 01:19:57,302
我们再集中火力去打人质营
we regroup and get the hostages.

953
01:19:58,442 --> 01:19:59,892
你赶紧通知一下石头
Quickly tell Shitou

954
01:19:59,952 --> 01:20:00,912
还有佟莉
and Li Tong

955
01:20:01,262 --> 01:20:02,862
让他们化装成恐怖分子
to disguise themselves as terrorists

956
01:20:02,932 --> 01:20:04,102
潜入人质营
and infiltrate the camp.

957
01:20:04,312 --> 01:20:08,092
记住 是让佟莉和邓梅互换服装
Remember. Li Tong and Mei Deng will trade clothes.

958
01:20:08,312 --> 01:20:10,682
让石头带着她原路返回
Shitou will take her back the way we came.

959
01:20:10,832 --> 01:20:12,702
你还要去通知一下顾顺和李懂
Tell Shun Gu and Dong Li.

960
01:20:12,872 --> 01:20:13,852
让他们寻找制高点
Find an over watch

961
01:20:13,922 --> 01:20:16,162
控制住整个广场区域范围
where they can control the square.

962
01:20:16,782 --> 01:20:18,222
一会儿我们进到镇里
Once we enter the town,

963
01:20:18,872 --> 01:20:20,582
所有人的信号都会被屏蔽
all our signals will be jammed.

964
01:20:20,672 --> 01:20:22,282
所以我现在要找到庄羽
So I have to tell Yu Zhuang

965
01:20:22,392 --> 01:20:23,842
通知他加设反干扰器
to set up an anti-jamming device

966
01:20:23,882 --> 01:20:26,162
确保我们所有人行动当中的通讯
to secure our communications.

967
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:28,042
至于夏楠
As for Nan Xia,

968
01:20:28,152 --> 01:20:29,832
就让她跟庄羽留守在这儿吧
have her stay here with Yu Zhuang.

969
01:20:29,892 --> 01:20:31,722
等邓梅撤出之后 他们一起撤离
They'll go as soon as Mei Deng's out.

970
01:20:31,842 --> 01:20:33,592
最后 你 我 还有陆琛
Finally, you, Chen Lu and I

971
01:20:33,642 --> 01:20:35,342
负责在广场范围内附近
will watch the square.

972
01:20:35,432 --> 01:20:38,192
一旦说邓梅安全地通过这个地方
Once we know Mei Deng is safe and has arrived

973
01:20:38,242 --> 01:20:39,152
撤到贝拉家
at Bella's house,

974
01:20:39,192 --> 01:20:40,272
我们要第一时间
we'll blow up

975
01:20:40,332 --> 01:20:42,072
把通往人质营的入口炸掉
their access to the camp.

976
01:20:42,232 --> 01:20:44,082
然后我们三个人进入人质营
The three of us will go into the camp

977
01:20:44,122 --> 01:20:46,712
带着全部的人质从这里撤出
and rescue the other hostages.

978
01:20:47,952 --> 01:20:49,652
可是如果佟莉留在人质营
But if Li Tong is with them,

979
01:20:49,972 --> 01:20:51,442
万一广场一旦打起来了
and a battle breaks out in the square,

980
01:20:51,512 --> 01:20:53,062
咱们火力不够 人手不够
we won't have enough firepower.

981
01:20:53,152 --> 01:20:54,482
你们现在已经人手不够
You're already outnumbered.

982
01:20:54,592 --> 01:20:55,622
除非拿我去换
I'll switch with Mei Deng.

983
01:20:55,702 --> 01:20:57,262
我比较更像一些
I look more like her too.

984
01:21:00,192 --> 01:21:01,062
队长

985
01:21:01,382 --> 01:21:02,312

989

求求你…

990

你的伤口处理得不太好
Your wound is not looking so good.

992
01:21:46,252 --> 01:21:48,522

1327
01:58:06,452 --> 01:58:07,422
舰长 政委

1328
01:58:07,492 --> 01:58:09,842
无人机已经侦测到杨锐 徐宏的定位

1343
02:01:16,242 --> 02:01:17,342
受天气影响
<i>The weather is preventing us</i>

1344
02:01:17,402 --> 02:01:18,902
我们暂时联系不到你们的军舰
<i>from contacting your warship,</i>

1345
02:01:18,952 --> 02:01:21,902
黄饼的事情我们现在暂无暇处理
<i>and we are unable to deal with the "yellow cake" situation at the moment.</i>

1346
02:01:22,022 --> 02:01:24,312
最多只能提供一架直升机
<i>All we can provide is a helicopter.</i>

1347
02:01:26,532 --> 02:01:28,182
这个…
This

1348
02:01:29,712 --> 02:01:31,262
非常管用

这次的黄饼危机
We can't just ignore

02:01:41,132 --> 02:01:42,742
我们不可置之不理
this "yellow cake" crisis.

1352
02:01:43,142 --> 02:01:44,992
那些黄饼的藏匿地点
The hiding place for the "yellow cake"

1353
02:01:45,112 --> 02:01:46,422
距离此处80公里

But in 40 minutes,

1355

这些恐怖分子就会离开

1356
02:01:50,372 --> 02:01:51,802
所以我们必须抓紧时间

1357
02:01:51,852 --> 02:01:53,402
但是有一点我必须强调

02:01:53,472 --> 02:01:54,862
这次行动
This operation

1359

1362
02:02:04,142 --> 02:02:05,062
队长

1363
02:02:05,392 --> 02:02:06,782
我在等你下命令
I'll wait for your orders.

1364
02:02:19,982 --> 02:02:21,532
"强者无敌"
"Conquer fear, conquer all."

1365
02:02:52,182 --> 02:02:54,702
距离目标位置两公里
<i>Two kilometers from destination!</i>

1366
02:03:43,232 --> 02:03:44,862
我们的目标是抢黄饼

1367

你跟我控制飞机抢黄饼

1371
02:03:50,152 --> 02:03:51,502
找位置掩护我们

1372
02:03:51,802 --> 02:03:52,802
散开

1373
02:04:15,192 --> 02:04:16,872
队长 我们到位

我应该可以一枪做到的

你很久没有回家乡了
