00:00:54,626 --> 00:00:55,876
<i>I was always wondering...</i>

2
00:00:56,376 --> 00:00:58,751
<i>what my future would be like.</i>

3
00:01:02,501 --> 00:01:03,167
Good morning, Truly.

4
00:01:03,292 --> 00:01:03,626
Morning.

5
00:01:03,751 --> 00:01:05,459
<i>Graduate from my dream school,</i>

6
00:01:05,584 --> 00:01:06,667
<i>fully develop my potential,</i>

7
00:01:06,792 --> 00:01:07,751
<i>realize my dreams.</i>

8
00:01:07,876 --> 00:01:10,209
Bravo!

9
00:01:11,584 --> 00:01:12,876
The lucrative deal in Shenzhen

10
00:01:13,584 --> 00:01:15,292
is finally signed to us.

11
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:16,667
Listen,

12
00:01:17,376 --> 00:01:18,709
you should learn more from Truly.

13
00:01:18,834 --> 00:01:20,376
Do everything you can for the company.

14
00:01:20,501 --> 00:01:22,459
Fight for more good deals!

15
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:23,334
Cheers!

16
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:25,042
Thank you boss.

17
00:01:25,167 --> 00:01:25,792
Thank you.

18
00:01:25,917 --> 00:01:26,501
Wow!

19
00:01:26,626 --> 00:01:28,209
What is this, Truly?

20
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:29,667
So shiny!

21
00:01:38,876 --> 00:01:41,167
<i>My life will shine...</i>

22
00:01:41,292 --> 00:01:42,584
<i>like a diamond.</i>

23
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:08,626
Hurray!

24
00:02:08,751 --> 00:02:09,667
Shall we got for spicy hot pot?

25
00:02:09,792 --> 00:02:10,251
Sure.

26
00:02:10,376 --> 00:02:12,126
Which restaurant? I'll make a reservation.

27
00:02:12,251 --> 00:02:12,834
Hello?

28
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,292
What time do you think it is?

29
00:02:14,626 --> 00:02:16,209
Why are you still in the office?

30
00:02:16,334 --> 00:02:17,667
I've been waiting for 5 minutes.

31
00:02:17,792 --> 00:02:18,501
Sorry.

32
00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:19,667
I'll go to the restaurant now.

33
00:02:19,792 --> 00:02:21,459
If you're not here in 5 minutes, I'll leave.

34
00:02:21,584 --> 00:02:22,709
That's not enough time!

35
00:02:22,834 --> 00:02:25,084
It'll take me half an hour to get there.

36
00:02:25,209 --> 00:02:26,917
Hello?

37
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:28,834
Shit.

38
00:02:30,626 --> 00:02:32,292
Conference call with Edinburgh at midnight.

39
00:02:32,417 --> 00:02:34,667
Your team will stay to prepare for it.

40
00:02:34,792 --> 00:02:35,917
But I have...

41
00:02:47,792 --> 00:02:49,417
I'll do it now.

42
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:54,459
Look at Truly.

43
00:02:54,792 --> 00:02:55,709
What a role model!

44
00:02:58,501 --> 00:02:59,542
Yes, sir.

45
00:03:01,709 --> 00:03:03,167
Everyone.

46
00:03:03,667 --> 00:03:06,042
Let's stay a little longer to work on it.

47
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:07,209
Go! Go! Go!

48
00:03:07,334 --> 00:03:09,459
Earlier done, earlier home.

49
00:03:13,542 --> 00:03:15,584
<i>No one ever told me,</i>

50
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:17,334
<i>the truth is...when you grow up,</i>

51
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,251
<i>it's likely you'll have a not-so-good job,</i>

52
00:03:20,376 --> 00:03:22,751
<i>be in a not-so-good relationship,</i>

53
00:03:23,209 --> 00:03:26,834
<i>and live a not-so-good life.</i>

54
00:03:27,584 --> 00:03:29,042
...dunno what he wants to eat.

55
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:31,501
It seems like Hsin is on a diet...

56
00:03:32,376 --> 00:03:35,959
Go! Go !Go! Early done, early home.

57
00:03:36,751 --> 00:03:38,376
She's the one who told us to stay.

58
00:03:38,501 --> 00:03:40,167
I won't get her bonus anyway.

59
00:03:40,292 --> 00:03:42,542
The manager told us to learn from Truly.

60
00:03:42,667 --> 00:03:44,501
Fuck! Who wants to learn from her?

61
00:03:44,626 --> 00:03:47,167
Working overtime for little salary.

62
00:03:47,626 --> 00:03:49,042
She treats the company as her family.

63
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:50,876
The company treats her as animal.

64
00:03:52,542 --> 00:03:54,209
To be honest,

65
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,417
I feel bad for people like her.

66
00:03:55,542 --> 00:03:58,251
I hope I won't be like her when I get old.

67
00:03:58,376 --> 00:04:01,334
Who wants to be like her! Miserable.

68
00:04:04,876 --> 00:04:06,292
<i>I think...</i>

69
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:08,209
<i>if I ran into this woman</i>

70
00:04:08,334 --> 00:04:10,751
<i>when I was 18,</i>

71
00:04:11,209 --> 00:04:13,334
<i>I would have definitely laughed at her</i>

72
00:04:13,459 --> 00:04:15,417
<i>like them, without mercy.</i>

73
00:04:17,709 --> 00:04:19,667
<i>Yabiyabi. Good evening everyone.</i>

74
00:04:19,792 --> 00:04:21,167
<i>This is Guangyu.</i>

75
00:04:21,501 --> 00:04:24,292
<i>Do you like who you are now?</i>

76
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:27,167
<i>When we grow up,</i>

77
00:04:27,292 --> 00:04:30,209
<i>we become sophisticated
and tend to compromise</i>

78
00:04:30,334 --> 00:04:31,584
<i>in order to survive.</i>

79
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:34,792
<i>We become someone we don't recognize.</i>

80
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:39,167
<i>Would you sometimes
miss the time when you</i>

81
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:40,917
<i>were rather naive and dared to dream?</i>

82
00:04:42,626 --> 00:04:45,792
<i>Is that part of you still there?</i>

83
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:49,459
<i>Do you still remember those people</i>

84
00:04:49,584 --> 00:04:50,709
<i>who played an important role in your life?</i>

85
00:04:50,834 --> 00:04:51,876
<i>(My dream: Go to Andy Lau's concert...)</i>

86
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:54,584
<i>Tonight,</i>

87
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:56,459
<i>we'll start our program with</i>

88
00:04:56,584 --> 00:04:58,584
<i>this song from me to you all.</i>

89
00:04:58,709 --> 00:05:00,584
<i>A song we haven't heard for a long time.</i>

90
00:05:00,709 --> 00:05:03,542
<i>"Forget Love Water" by Andy Lau.</i>

91
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,667
<i>Good morning. Here is the latest news...</i>

92
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,834
<i>yesterday Alec Su of The Little Tigers</i>

93
00:05:38,959 --> 00:05:42,834
<i>said he dropped out of Taiwan University.</i>

94
00:05:42,959 --> 00:05:45,292
<i>The whole entertainment world is in shock.</i>

95
00:06:08,251 --> 00:06:10,167
Are you giving birth? Are you done or not?

96
00:06:10,292 --> 00:06:11,542
I'm done!

97
00:06:15,251 --> 00:06:17,417
<i>Back then, I was turning 18</i>

98
00:06:17,542 --> 00:06:19,917
<i>and truly understood something important:</i>

99
00:06:20,459 --> 00:06:21,834
<i>History has proven that, there are mainly</i>

100
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,751
<i>two types of young girls in the world.</i>

101
00:06:23,876 --> 00:06:25,542
Hey, here she comes.

102
00:06:25,667 --> 00:06:27,542
Wow! How elegant.

103
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:29,501
Oh my God! She's gorgeous!

104
00:06:29,626 --> 00:06:31,292
So cute!

105
00:06:32,376 --> 00:06:34,584
<i>Pretty girls who are popular...</i>

106
00:06:37,209 --> 00:06:38,167
Don't go!

107
00:06:38,417 --> 00:06:39,376
Wait for me! -Tao Minmin!

108
00:06:39,501 --> 00:06:40,126
<i>and</i>

109
00:06:40,251 --> 00:06:41,792
<i>those who are not pretty.</i>

110
00:06:44,292 --> 00:06:45,542
<i>My name is Lin Truly.</i>

111
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:47,751
<i>Sorry!</i>

112
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:49,876
<i>I'm the one who just fell on the street.</i>

113
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:53,376
<i>If you're a guy,</i>

114
00:06:53,792 --> 00:06:55,667
<i>let me tell you a story of an ordinary girl</i>

115
00:06:55,792 --> 00:06:59,667
<i>who you've never bothered to care about</i>

116
00:06:59,792 --> 00:07:01,917
<i>and her ordinary life.</i>

117
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:27,167
<i>Back then, the most important decision</i>

118
00:07:27,292 --> 00:07:29,334
<i>we had to make every day</i>

119
00:07:29,459 --> 00:07:32,126
<i>was what to eat for breakfast.</i>

120
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:33,292
Can you please hurry up?

121
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:34,792
Is it that tough to decide?

122
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,834
<i>was on the day of exam,</i>

123
00:07:40,959 --> 00:07:42,167
<i>we'd say...</i>

124
00:07:42,376 --> 00:07:43,751
I didn't prepare for it.

125
00:07:44,751 --> 00:07:46,459
Neither did I.

126
00:07:46,584 --> 00:07:48,334
I thought we were having math exam.

127
00:07:48,459 --> 00:07:49,709
<i>The most luxurious thing to do,</i>

128
00:07:49,834 --> 00:07:51,667
<i>was to go shopping in the bookstore.</i>

129
00:07:51,792 --> 00:07:52,792
<i>Back then,</i>

130
00:07:52,917 --> 00:07:55,876
<i>that was our department store.</i>

131
00:07:56,584 --> 00:07:58,209
<i>The biggest dream we had</i>

132
00:07:58,334 --> 00:07:58,834
<i>was to meet our idols</i>

133
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:00,292
<i>one day.</i>

134
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:03,584
The shame of being shameless
is shameless

135
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:07,209
<i>Somehow young girls of that time</i>

136
00:08:07,334 --> 00:08:09,876
<i>had some kind of fantasy.</i>

137
00:08:10,584 --> 00:08:12,292
<i>We believed whoever collected most photos</i>

138
00:08:12,417 --> 00:08:13,042
<i>would be the most qualified person</i>

139
00:08:13,167 --> 00:08:15,167
<i>to marry him.</i>

140
00:08:17,542 --> 00:08:18,667
<i>This is Small.</i>

141
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:20,417
<i>Although large in size,</i>

142
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,501
<i>she is a super romantic teenage girl.</i>

143
00:08:22,792 --> 00:08:24,417
<i>Kaneshiro Takeshi is her ex,</i>

144
00:08:24,542 --> 00:08:25,251
<i>and now</i>

145
00:08:25,376 --> 00:08:27,626
<i>Aaron Kwok is her fiance.</i>

146
00:08:31,792 --> 00:08:33,417
Even I am not married yet,

147
00:08:34,167 --> 00:08:35,376
how come you already have a husband?

148
00:08:36,376 --> 00:08:37,584
Boss Lau...

149
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:40,792
However hard you try, he'll never reply.

150
00:08:42,292 --> 00:08:45,167
What you do is called shameless.

151
00:08:50,584 --> 00:08:51,792
<i>This is Meimei.</i>

152
00:08:51,917 --> 00:08:53,417
<i>Very cheerful,</i>

153
00:08:53,542 --> 00:08:56,501
<i>but...almost too cheerful.</i>

154
00:08:57,917 --> 00:09:00,209
Girls, where are you going?

155
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:04,751
<i>Back in our teenage life, we were always</i>

156
00:09:04,876 --> 00:09:07,584
<i>doing silly things apart from studying.</i>

157
00:09:08,376 --> 00:09:09,501
<i>And this is the silliest</i>

158
00:09:09,626 --> 00:09:11,334
<i>among all.</i>

159
00:09:12,667 --> 00:09:14,709
Ouyang is coming. He's so handsome.

160
00:09:14,834 --> 00:09:16,667
Hey, be quiet. Come on.

161
00:09:16,876 --> 00:09:19,001
He has a style. He's here.

162
00:09:22,751 --> 00:09:24,667
<i>There is always a boy like this,</i>

163
00:09:24,792 --> 00:09:26,542
<i>in every teenage girl's life.</i>

164
00:09:30,667 --> 00:09:31,626
Thank you.

165
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:37,709
It's on me.

166
00:09:38,417 --> 00:09:39,292
60 please. -60.

167
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:40,376
60 please. -60.

168
00:09:43,251 --> 00:09:46,417
<i>Somehow they're always basketball players,</i>

169
00:09:51,167 --> 00:09:55,209
<i>secret crush for every girl in the school.</i>

170
00:09:58,667 --> 00:10:01,084
I feel Ouyang is looking at me.

171
00:10:01,209 --> 00:10:03,667
I think he's looking at me.

172
00:10:07,334 --> 00:10:10,667
<i>We can giggle for the whole day</i>

173
00:10:10,792 --> 00:10:12,376
<i>just because of a look from him.</i>

174
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:21,709
Dear all, can you please stop helping

175
00:10:21,834 --> 00:10:24,251
those idiots send love letters

176
00:10:24,376 --> 00:10:26,251
to our Minmin?

177
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:27,792
Especially this kind of idiot,

178
00:10:27,917 --> 00:10:30,209
who misused "disney" for "destiny".

179
00:10:31,876 --> 00:10:34,251
<i>This kind of ordinary, simple life</i>

180
00:10:34,376 --> 00:10:37,251

<i>(to Lin Truly)</i>

186
00:10:59,167 --> 00:11:00,167
<i>and the good luck is yours.</i>

187
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:02,917
<i>Otherwise disasters will be waiting for you.</i>

188
00:11:03,501 --> 00:11:04,376
<i>In 1979, Mr. Chen from Taiwan did not</i>

189
00:11:04,501 --> 00:11:07,167
<i>take the letter seriously and tore it apart.</i>

190
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:09,251
<i>...he died in a car accident the next day.</i>

191
00:11:09,376 --> 00:11:12,459
<i>In 1963, Flayre from Holland burnt it...</i>

192
00:11:12,584 --> 00:11:14,584
<i>3 days later, his mother started to...</i>

193
00:11:14,709 --> 00:11:16,209
<i>suffer an incurable disease.</i>

194
00:11:26,167 --> 00:11:27,667
<i>(You still have three days. Good luck.)</i>

195
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:37,042
<i>The person I want to send chain letter to</i>

196
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:38,459
<i>the most, is Lin Sincere.</i>

197
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,959
5 places in this exam.

198
00:11:45,376 --> 00:11:47,584
Last time he got the lowest score. Besides,

199
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:49,626
he's spent 7 years on a 5-year program...

200
00:11:49,751 --> 00:11:51,084
Don't you talk back!

201
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:53,167
Only if you could get half of the grade

202
00:11:54,626 --> 00:11:55,959
30 points.

203
00:11:56,876 --> 00:11:57,709
You even tried to alter it

204
00:11:57,834 --> 00:11:58,959
with a different color.

205
00:11:59,959 --> 00:12:01,292
How stupid!

206
00:12:01,417 --> 00:12:03,334
My red pen ran out of ink.

207
00:12:07,792 --> 00:12:08,792
Take it.

208
00:12:09,376 --> 00:12:10,667
Thank you mom.

209
00:12:10,792 --> 00:12:11,501
Take one more.

210
00:12:11,626 --> 00:12:12,626
Thank you dad!

211
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:18,334
<i>Many of you probably
had the same thought,</i>

212
00:12:18,792 --> 00:12:22,459
<i>"Am I'm really my parents' child?"</i>

213
00:12:22,584 --> 00:12:25,167
<i>But if my brother's family is really ruined,</i>

214
00:12:25,292 --> 00:12:26,917
<i>I might suffer as well.</i>

215
00:12:27,542 --> 00:12:29,209
<i>So I dismissed that idea.</i>

216
00:12:32,209 --> 00:12:33,459
<i>I gave the first letter</i>

217
00:12:33,584 --> 00:12:34,959
<i>to him.</i>

218
00:12:36,501 --> 00:12:37,584
Lin Truly.

219
00:12:38,417 --> 00:12:39,584
Question 1:

220
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:43,167
If the balls are put in the order of red,

221
00:12:43,292 --> 00:12:45,626
blue, green, what's the color of ball 555?

222
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:48,334
It's ok if you don't know the answer,

223
00:12:49,626 --> 00:12:52,376
but why drawing it like this?

224
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:53,667
Don't you dodge!

225
00:12:53,792 --> 00:12:55,209
<i>There must be a psycho teacher like this</i>

226
00:12:55,334 --> 00:12:57,376
<i>in everyone's school years.</i>

227
00:12:57,792 --> 00:12:59,501
<i>"Wang Baidan"</i>

228
00:12:59,876 --> 00:13:02,167
<i>Our home room teacher and math teacher.</i>

229
00:13:02,376 --> 00:13:03,709
<i>We all call him</i>

230
00:13:03,834 --> 00:13:05,459
<i>"Wang Badan" (asshole)</i>

231
00:13:07,167 --> 00:13:08,376
I haven't even started!

232
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:09,501
Come back.

233
00:13:10,501 --> 00:13:11,751
You're even louder than me.

234
00:13:33,167 --> 00:13:34,459
<i>I gave the second letter</i>

235
00:13:34,584 --> 00:13:35,876
<i>to Tao Minmin.</i>

236
00:13:36,626 --> 00:13:38,459
<i>It's definitely not because I envy her</i>

237
00:13:40,334 --> 00:13:41,334
<i>Not even because</i>

238
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,209
<i>she's that girl who could</i>

239
00:13:43,334 --> 00:13:44,709
<i>get his attention.</i>

240
00:13:47,917 --> 00:13:52,209
<i>It's simply because she lives next door.</i>

241
00:13:52,584 --> 00:13:54,292
<i>Right on my way home.</i>

242
00:14:08,542 --> 00:14:10,042
What? A good student?

243
00:14:10,209 --> 00:14:11,751
Do the recycling.

244
00:14:17,584 --> 00:14:18,667
Hey you.

245
00:14:19,584 --> 00:14:20,709
Kick it back.

246
00:14:31,959 --> 00:14:33,709
Ouyang Extraordinary.

247
00:14:35,292 --> 00:14:37,542
I might've seen this disgusting name before.

248
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:40,042
<i>As there is a "God" in every school,</i>

249
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:42,876
<i>there is also a "boss".</i>

250
00:14:47,376 --> 00:14:48,376
Stand up.

251
00:14:54,667 --> 00:14:56,417
<i>Hsu Taiyu.</i>

252
00:14:56,709 --> 00:14:59,209
<i>Last number of the last class in 3rd grade.</i>

253
00:14:59,501 --> 00:15:02,251
<i>He's the boss who leads our school in</i>

254
00:15:02,376 --> 00:15:03,834
<i>turf wars and charge others protection fee.</i>

255
00:15:04,376 --> 00:15:04,709
<i>Rumor has it that</i>

256
00:15:04,834 --> 00:15:08,292
<i>he fights, runs away from home,
he's on drug</i>

257
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:09,792
<i>has killed people, set fire...</i>

258
00:15:09,917 --> 00:15:12,542
<i>So notorious that no school wants him,</i>

259
00:15:12,667 --> 00:15:14,417
<i>except for First High School...</i>

260
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:16,042
How daring are you to be here.

261
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:17,501
You despise us
the 12 Masters of First High?

262
00:15:18,792 --> 00:15:21,251
What about Ten Brothers
from Chuoshui River?

263
00:15:21,876 --> 00:15:23,167
Kill them.

264
00:15:33,334 --> 00:15:35,834
<i>He's even appointed as school patrol</i>

265
00:15:35,959 --> 00:15:37,042
Indecent clothing.

266
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:38,126
Eating while walking.

267
00:15:38,251 --> 00:15:39,417
Studying too hard.

268
00:15:41,667 --> 00:15:42,501
Too matured body.

269
00:15:44,376 --> 00:15:45,292
<i>First High...</i>

270
00:15:45,417 --> 00:15:47,792
<i>has since been trapped
in the devil's clutches.</i>

271
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:50,376
Recycle it!

272
00:16:00,751 --> 00:16:01,876
Hey, what are you doing?

273
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:03,876
Why bully others like this?

274
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:05,917
What the hell are you guys doing?

275
00:16:06,917 --> 00:16:08,334
Here comes the director,

276
00:16:08,917 --> 00:16:10,542
let's go.

277
00:16:14,751 --> 00:16:17,084
Come on! Go, go.

278
00:16:20,876 --> 00:16:21,959
Chicken.

279
00:16:29,167 --> 00:16:30,542
<i>Therefore...</i>

280
00:16:30,876 --> 00:16:32,626
<i>I decided to send him the third letter.</i>

281
00:16:50,792 --> 00:16:51,501
Guile.

282
00:16:51,626 --> 00:16:53,376
G your mother.

283
00:16:59,876 --> 00:17:00,959
Sorry

284
00:17:07,709 --> 00:17:09,167
<i>(to Hsu Taiyu)</i>

285
00:17:12,167 --> 00:17:13,376
It's pink

286
00:17:13,751 --> 00:17:15,209
with fragrance.

287
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,417
Love letter?

288
00:17:17,542 --> 00:17:18,334
Aren't you over the moon, boss?

289
00:17:18,459 --> 00:17:20,417
Over what! Get lost.

290
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,334
Who has the guts to write him a love letter?

291
00:17:26,459 --> 00:17:27,834
Oh, he was even blushing.

292
00:17:27,959 --> 00:17:29,792
Blushing! Hahahaha

293
00:17:29,917 --> 00:17:31,667
He must be over the moon now.

294
00:17:32,251 --> 00:17:33,584
Not just over the moon...

295
00:17:33,709 --> 00:17:37,292
Over the whole world!

296
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:43,501
Boss.

297
00:17:44,459 --> 00:17:46,126
Did you hear about it already?

298
00:17:46,251 --> 00:17:48,626
Hsu Taiyu had a car accident yesterday.

299
00:17:58,251 --> 00:18:00,417
Lin Truly...

300
00:18:08,376 --> 00:18:10,667
If I find out who cursed boss,

301
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:13,584
I'll make sure to break his arms and legs.

302
00:18:13,709 --> 00:18:15,792
Sorry, she needs to take her medicine.

303
00:18:16,626 --> 00:18:18,459
Lin Truly, let's go.

304
00:18:18,584 --> 00:18:20,376
Why are you so heavy!

305
00:18:25,917 --> 00:18:26,584
Go.

306
00:18:27,376 --> 00:18:28,084
Boss, watch your step.

307
00:18:28,209 --> 00:18:30,084
Someone is spreading the rumor,

308
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:31,751
saying this year's school anniversary

309
00:18:32,251 --> 00:18:35,167
will be suspended due to track renovation.

310
00:18:35,584 --> 00:18:37,167
Let me clarify it here.

311
00:18:37,876 --> 00:18:39,501
This year, school anniversary festival

312
00:18:40,376 --> 00:18:42,334
will be held as scheduled.

313
00:18:45,209 --> 00:18:48,542
Since I'm retiring from First High soon.

314
00:18:49,376 --> 00:18:51,167
The new director will take over

315
00:18:51,584 --> 00:18:54,126
the responsibility as the organizer.

316
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:57,626
Last but not least, do not leave yet.

317
00:18:57,751 --> 00:18:59,084
School patrol is now conducting

318
00:18:59,209 --> 00:19:03,376
a surprise safety inspection.

319
00:19:12,209 --> 00:19:13,167
Dahe.

320
00:19:13,292 --> 00:19:14,209
Breast baring.

321
00:19:15,292 --> 00:19:16,251
That's too nasty.

322
00:19:16,376 --> 00:19:17,126
Make a note.

323
00:19:17,251 --> 00:19:18,376
Confiscate it.

324
00:20:05,167 --> 00:20:06,417
Hey you.

325
00:20:07,459 --> 00:20:08,792
We need to talk.

326
00:20:19,376 --> 00:20:21,376
Where are we going?

327
00:20:21,584 --> 00:20:23,334
Just follow us.

328
00:20:24,792 --> 00:20:25,584
No!

329
00:20:25,709 --> 00:20:27,876
Enjoy, boss.

330
00:20:40,626 --> 00:20:42,251
In 1979,

331
00:20:42,376 --> 00:20:43,709
Mr. Chen from Taiwan...

332
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:45,042
did not take the letter seriously

333
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:46,626
and tore it apart.

334
00:20:46,751 --> 00:20:48,501
The next day he died in a car accident.

335
00:20:55,167 --> 00:20:56,542
So it's you.

336
00:21:04,167 --> 00:21:05,167
Whose films do you like?

337
00:21:06,626 --> 00:21:07,084
What?

338
00:21:07,209 --> 00:21:07,876
Who?

339
00:21:10,959 --> 00:21:13,417
S...Stephen Chow.

340
00:21:15,959 --> 00:21:17,459
Which film do you like best?

341
00:21:18,584 --> 00:21:19,667
All..."All's Well, Ends Well".

342
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:21,292
How many "all"s?

343
00:21:21,417 --> 00:21:23,167
One.

344
00:21:24,501 --> 00:21:25,709
Your birthday?

345
00:21:31,376 --> 00:21:32,959
Good, you're honest.

346
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,417
What don't you like about me?

347
00:21:36,334 --> 00:21:37,834
Nothing.

348
00:21:38,334 --> 00:21:40,376
I...think...you're

349
00:21:40,917 --> 00:21:41,959
tall...

350
00:21:42,376 --> 00:21:43,209
and cute...

351
00:21:43,417 --> 00:21:44,417
and if I look closely...

352
00:21:44,542 --> 00:21:46,167
You even look a bit like Andy Lau?

353
00:21:52,292 --> 00:21:53,584
I know you sent the chain letter to me

354
00:21:53,959 --> 00:21:55,584
because of him.

355
00:22:00,292 --> 00:22:01,417
No!

356
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:02,834
What no?

357
00:22:03,501 --> 00:22:04,792
I can't change the film?

358
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:11,376
Would you like to change the film?

359
00:22:12,834 --> 00:22:13,709
Yes, to...

360
00:22:13,834 --> 00:22:15,626
All..."All's Well, Ends Well".

361
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:16,792
Sure, just a moment.

362
00:22:22,251 --> 00:22:23,376
Let's...

363
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,167
be friends.

364
00:22:26,542 --> 00:22:27,542
What?

365
00:22:30,834 --> 00:22:32,501
You just introduced yourself.

366
00:22:37,376 --> 00:22:39,709
<i>In Taiyu's dictionary, friend means</i>

367
00:22:39,834 --> 00:22:42,167
<i>unconditional devotion.</i>

368
00:22:46,792 --> 00:22:48,876
<i>In order to protect Ouyang,</i>

369
00:22:49,376 --> 00:22:51,459
<i>I'm willing to listen to Hsu Taiyu.</i>

370
00:22:51,584 --> 00:22:52,876
<i>Be his slave.</i>

371
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:56,834
Auntie.

372
00:22:56,959 --> 00:22:58,042
One sesame noodle.

373
00:22:58,167 --> 00:22:58,667
Don't put sesame dressing and noodles

374
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:00,459
together. They need to be separated.

375
00:23:00,584 --> 00:23:02,251
No fatty no lean for braised pork rice

376
00:23:02,376 --> 00:23:03,251
but half half.

377
00:23:03,376 --> 00:23:04,251
And veggie tofu soup without spring onion.

378
00:23:04,376 --> 00:23:06,584
Two eggs in it but don't beat it.

379
00:23:07,209 --> 00:23:08,292
Thank you.

380
00:23:11,834 --> 00:23:14,709
If no spring onion in veggie tofu soup,

381
00:23:16,376 --> 00:23:18,459
why have it on sesame noodles?

382
00:23:18,792 --> 00:23:19,959
Get a new one!

383
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:32,292
Wait.

384
00:23:33,584 --> 00:23:34,501
This is your reward.

385
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:36,501
Autographed photo of Andy Lau.

386
00:23:41,959 --> 00:23:44,209
It's Andy Low from the TV show.

387
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:05,501
Here.

388
00:24:07,584 --> 00:24:10,501
I thought you forgot your book for math

389
00:24:10,626 --> 00:24:11,834
excursion, where are the other people?

390
00:24:13,626 --> 00:24:14,709
Idiot.

391
00:24:15,584 --> 00:24:17,376
What kind of excursion for math class?

392
00:24:17,959 --> 00:24:18,917
Hurry up.

393
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:20,501
The movie starts at 2.

394
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:22,709
Ah...

395
00:24:22,917 --> 00:24:25,376
The bell rang already, I'm going back.

396
00:24:25,626 --> 00:24:26,709
Then who'll get food for me?

397
00:24:26,834 --> 00:24:27,626
Who'll collect my trash?

398
00:24:27,751 --> 00:24:28,417
Who'll fan for me?

399
00:24:31,626 --> 00:24:32,667
I can't climb the wall.

400
00:24:32,792 --> 00:24:33,584
So...

401
00:24:33,709 --> 00:24:35,292
I really can't do this.

402
00:24:37,584 --> 00:24:38,792
You wanna die?

403
00:24:38,917 --> 00:24:40,501
What if the teacher finds out?

404
00:24:40,626 --> 00:24:42,251
I've never skipped class in my life...

405
00:24:42,376 --> 00:24:44,501
If you've never done that in your uniform,

406
00:24:44,626 --> 00:24:47,417
you'll regret in the future.

407
00:24:49,876 --> 00:24:51,626
You're so heavy.

408
00:25:24,251 --> 00:25:25,042
Hurry up.

409
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:26,167
Don't goof off.

410
00:25:26,584 --> 00:25:29,501
Can I go back for tutorial class?

411
00:25:33,959 --> 00:25:35,626
Attach yourself to the end of the line.

412
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:44,376
Hsu Taiyu, I had enough!

413
00:25:57,959 --> 00:25:58,917
Are you ok?

414
00:25:59,292 --> 00:26:00,417
Are you alright?

415
00:26:03,959 --> 00:26:05,251
I'm ok...

416
00:26:06,459 --> 00:26:08,417
Then go get squid balls for me!

417
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:12,209
Hsu Taiyu!

418
00:26:16,584 --> 00:26:17,667
Thank you.

419
00:26:18,959 --> 00:26:21,417
Go away! What are you looking at?
Sit down.

420
00:26:29,459 --> 00:26:30,459
Quickly!

421
00:26:31,209 --> 00:26:31,834
Sit!

422
00:26:32,917 --> 00:26:33,751
Sit tight!

423
00:26:34,376 --> 00:26:35,209
Hsu Taiyu.

424
00:26:35,584 --> 00:26:36,917
Don't you dare touch my gal...

425
00:26:38,334 --> 00:26:38,834
What's wrong!

426
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:40,834
Holding hands when roller skating?

427
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:44,292
How can you do it without holding hands?

428
00:26:44,417 --> 00:26:45,542
Shut up!

429
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:47,251
What?

430
00:26:48,542 --> 00:26:49,417
Kill him.

431
00:26:56,542 --> 00:26:57,376
Sakuraki.

432
00:27:30,459 --> 00:27:31,417
Hsu Taiyu!

433
00:27:54,459 --> 00:27:55,459
Boss, are you ok?

434
00:27:55,584 --> 00:27:56,542
It's ok.

435
00:27:59,834 --> 00:28:00,959
Hsu Taiyu!

436
00:28:01,709 --> 00:28:04,251
If I didn't have final exam this afternoon,

437
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:06,792
I'll never let you get away with it!

438
00:28:06,917 --> 00:28:08,501
Let's go back to study!

439
00:28:19,584 --> 00:28:20,876
I'll get you, you motherfucker!

440
00:28:25,709 --> 00:28:28,501
<i>(No distinction of classes in teaching.)</i>

441
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:40,167
Miss Lin.

442
00:28:40,292 --> 00:28:41,959
I know you're innocent.

443
00:28:42,584 --> 00:28:44,167
If you to tell me

444
00:28:44,501 --> 00:28:46,417
what happened at the skating rink,

445
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:47,834
you won't be punished.

446
00:28:48,376 --> 00:28:49,501
I...

447
00:29:05,709 --> 00:29:08,542
I don't...remember

448
00:29:09,751 --> 00:29:11,626
what happened when where who at all.

449
00:29:14,292 --> 00:29:16,876
Right. You went to indecent place

450
00:29:17,459 --> 00:29:18,751
during school hours. Your punishment is

451
00:29:18,876 --> 00:29:20,417
10 hours of pool cleaning.

452
00:29:20,542 --> 00:29:21,209
Go back to your class.

453
00:29:31,792 --> 00:29:33,292
What were you doing?

454
00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:40,959
Hey, school patrol!

455
00:29:41,209 --> 00:29:42,459
Lin Truly!

456
00:29:42,584 --> 00:29:45,251
How come you were in the office with Taiyu?

457
00:29:45,376 --> 00:29:47,376
Shhhh...for what?

458
00:29:47,501 --> 00:29:48,501
We can't what?

459
00:29:49,501 --> 00:29:50,876
I see! How many words?

460
00:29:51,834 --> 00:29:52,709
Ouyang!

461
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:54,251
Ouyang what?

462
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,459
See...

463
00:29:57,751 --> 00:29:58,792
...your face

464
00:29:59,834 --> 00:30:01,542
We can't let Ouyang see you.

465
00:30:02,626 --> 00:30:03,626
Yes!

466
00:30:03,751 --> 00:30:04,834
Lin Truly?

467
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:19,459
I didn't know you're actually pretty good.

468
00:30:21,292 --> 00:30:22,334
I also like roller skating too.

469
00:30:22,459 --> 00:30:23,667
Next time we can go together.

470
00:30:31,251 --> 00:30:32,251
Lin Truly.

471
00:30:32,376 --> 00:30:34,542
Ouyang knows your name!

472
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:36,334
And even asked you out...

473
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:40,209
Praised by Ouyang for skipping class...

474
00:30:40,334 --> 00:30:41,876
Strangely amazing.

475
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:45,459
Look, love fire is burning.

476
00:30:45,584 --> 00:30:47,417
Love fire is bouncing.

477
00:30:47,542 --> 00:30:49,334
Warmly, our hearts

478
00:30:49,459 --> 00:30:52,376
embrace each other.

479
00:30:55,751 --> 00:30:56,834
I told my mom...

480
00:30:58,709 --> 00:31:00,251
Did she give her approval?

481
00:31:00,626 --> 00:31:01,542
Yes.

482
00:31:02,626 --> 00:31:04,126
But...

483
00:31:04,251 --> 00:31:06,251
What if the teacher finds out

484
00:31:06,376 --> 00:31:07,501
about us...?

485
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:09,626
This is not allowed by the school.

486
00:31:11,959 --> 00:31:13,084
Don't worry.

487
00:31:13,209 --> 00:31:14,251
I am the father.

488
00:31:14,376 --> 00:31:15,792
I'll take the responsibility.

489
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,542
So glad you're here.

490
00:31:20,459 --> 00:31:21,376
You should go now!

491
00:31:21,501 --> 00:31:22,834
Others can come here anytime.

492
00:31:22,959 --> 00:31:23,959
They'll find us suspicious.

493
00:31:36,501 --> 00:31:37,959
Was someone here?

494
00:31:40,167 --> 00:31:41,251
What should we do?

495
00:31:41,376 --> 00:31:43,417
Will people find out about us?

496
00:31:44,626 --> 00:31:45,459
We'll be fine.

497
00:31:45,584 --> 00:31:47,334
Let's get out of here now.

498
00:32:51,626 --> 00:32:53,292
What the fuck are you looking at!

499
00:32:55,792 --> 00:32:57,667
Did you just try to drown yourself?

500
00:32:57,792 --> 00:32:59,501
Just for that prick?

501
00:33:01,376 --> 00:33:02,917
Then what on earth are you crying for?

502
00:33:03,376 --> 00:33:05,334
You're the silly one...

503
00:33:19,876 --> 00:33:22,584
Do you have it with you all the time?

504
00:33:24,626 --> 00:33:28,334
If you never had beer in your uniform...

505
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:29,709
I'll regret in the future.

506
00:33:30,459 --> 00:33:31,709
I got it.

507
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:47,542
You wrote this?

508
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:52,792
You like Tao Minmin?

509
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:05,292
Dear Tao Minmin:

510
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:09,209
When you were trying the hairpin yesterday,

511
00:34:09,584 --> 00:34:11,334
I really longed to touch...

512
00:34:11,459 --> 00:34:13,542
the beautiful black hair of yours!

513
00:34:14,584 --> 00:34:16,251
You're so sick.

514
00:34:17,334 --> 00:34:18,417
Because...

515
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:21,167
It's so nice to meet you

516
00:34:21,292 --> 00:34:22,959
do you know that?

517
00:34:23,792 --> 00:34:26,584
Quoting lyrics...you really suck.

518
00:34:31,501 --> 00:34:33,667
Now we're both kind of...

519
00:34:34,251 --> 00:34:35,917
Association of the Dumped members.

520
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,417
For the first time I think you're clever.

521
00:34:48,751 --> 00:34:49,876
What?

522
00:34:50,667 --> 00:34:52,376
Let's help them break up.

523
00:34:53,209 --> 00:34:54,751
If you help me chase Tao Minmin...

524
00:34:54,876 --> 00:34:55,709
wouldn't that make your Ouyang

525
00:34:55,834 --> 00:34:56,751
single again?

526
00:35:18,376 --> 00:35:19,542
Sorry! Sorry!

527
00:35:23,751 --> 00:35:24,626
Excuse me!

528
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:57,292
Did you bring powdered milk and bottle?

529
00:35:57,417 --> 00:35:58,417
Yeah.

530
00:35:59,626 --> 00:36:00,834
Hsu Taiyu!

531
00:36:04,417 --> 00:36:05,417
Sorry...

532
00:36:05,542 --> 00:36:06,709
Mommy's late.

533
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:08,667
You must be starving.

534
00:36:08,792 --> 00:36:10,709
Slowly... slowly.

535
00:36:11,376 --> 00:36:12,459
Look at the eyes...

536
00:36:12,584 --> 00:36:13,542
So adorable.

537
00:36:13,667 --> 00:36:14,792
Just like you.

538
00:36:16,751 --> 00:36:18,834
Should we take it to the vet for shots?

539
00:36:19,459 --> 00:36:22,376
Yeah. Let's do it after school soon.

540
00:36:22,626 --> 00:36:23,626
OK.

541
00:36:29,792 --> 00:36:32,376
We misunderstood them.

542
00:36:32,501 --> 00:36:33,667
There is nothing between them.

543
00:36:33,792 --> 00:36:35,626
Just a puppy.

544
00:36:36,376 --> 00:36:38,126
Having a dog now together means

545
00:36:38,251 --> 00:36:39,751
they'll walk the dog together. Get closer.

546
00:36:39,876 --> 00:36:42,126
Then the dog will have more puppies.

547
00:36:42,251 --> 00:36:43,667
We can't let this happen.

548
00:36:43,792 --> 00:36:45,417
Say that again. What do you think of me?

549
00:36:46,917 --> 00:36:48,209
You're tall...

550
00:36:48,334 --> 00:36:49,376
and cute...

551
00:36:49,709 --> 00:36:51,167
If I look closely...

552
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:53,459
You even look a bit like Andy Lau.

553
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:13,709
Tao Minmin!

554
00:37:16,376 --> 00:37:17,459
The campus belle!

555
00:37:19,417 --> 00:37:20,792
So pretty!

556
00:37:55,834 --> 00:37:57,376
Our boss is hot!

557
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:04,376
Tao Minmin.

558
00:38:04,501 --> 00:38:05,917
Wanna be my gal?

559
00:38:07,167 --> 00:38:16,792
Say yes Say yes\\<i>(U VUL I NIMNIM OAT)</i>

560
00:38:28,209 --> 00:38:29,792
If you dare to tell others what happened,

561
00:38:29,917 --> 00:38:31,709
you are dead.

562
00:38:32,334 --> 00:38:34,667
Don't you tell others boss is dumped.

563
00:38:34,792 --> 00:38:35,792
Let me repeat.

564
00:38:35,917 --> 00:38:37,751
Don't you tell others boss is dumped.

565
00:38:37,876 --> 00:38:39,417
What the fuck!

566
00:38:46,501 --> 00:38:47,959
Get out of there!

567
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:57,959
Hsu Taiyu...

568
00:39:08,501 --> 00:39:11,251
I think...we should give up.

569
00:39:11,626 --> 00:39:15,167
Tao Minmin...will not be attracted by you.

570
00:39:20,292 --> 00:39:22,501
There is no such word like "give up".

571
00:39:23,917 --> 00:39:25,126
<i>(Report stray dogs to have them caught.)</i>

572
00:39:25,251 --> 00:39:27,042
As long as the dog is gone,

573
00:39:27,167 --> 00:39:28,417
they won't have excuse to meet each other.

574
00:39:30,792 --> 00:39:32,167
Don't do silly things.

575
00:39:34,417 --> 00:39:35,584
I got it!

576
00:39:43,584 --> 00:39:44,751
Hurry up.

577
00:39:46,626 --> 00:39:49,667
Puppy...they'll think you ran away...

578
00:39:49,792 --> 00:39:51,042
you're not stolen.

579
00:39:51,167 --> 00:39:52,167
Hurry up!

580
00:39:52,626 --> 00:39:54,167
Someone's coming.

581
00:40:14,376 --> 00:40:15,751
Such a stupid idea.

582
00:40:15,876 --> 00:40:17,209
Where can he go?

583
00:40:17,334 --> 00:40:18,667
Who's gonna take care of him?

584
00:40:21,709 --> 00:40:23,792
I thought you were really that cruel,

585
00:40:23,917 --> 00:40:24,876
that you wouldn't care if he dies.

586
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:32,376
Before you can find him a new owner,

587
00:40:32,501 --> 00:40:33,959
he's staying with you.

588
00:40:36,584 --> 00:40:37,251
Why the fuck do you pee...

589
00:40:37,376 --> 00:40:38,584
Quick!

590
00:40:40,376 --> 00:40:41,626
Alright, alright.

591
00:40:45,376 --> 00:40:46,459
What should we call him?

592
00:40:50,626 --> 00:40:51,501
What about...

593
00:40:51,626 --> 00:40:52,626
Andy?

594
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:53,459
You like it?

595
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,084
No way.

596
00:40:55,209 --> 00:40:56,667
How can you humiliate my idol like this!

597
00:40:56,792 --> 00:40:57,834
Besides...

598
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:00,251
It's a she.

599
00:41:01,251 --> 00:41:02,459
ND the alphabets.

600
00:41:02,584 --> 00:41:03,584
Anything wrong?

601
00:41:04,376 --> 00:41:05,834
ND...ND...

602
00:41:05,959 --> 00:41:07,376
See! She doesn't like it!

603
00:41:07,501 --> 00:41:08,167
Why not?

604
00:41:08,292 --> 00:41:10,126
Because you can't humiliate my idol!

605
00:41:10,251 --> 00:41:12,376
Besides, she's a girl! -ND!

606
00:41:12,917 --> 00:41:14,667
I'm gonna rub some dog pee on your head.

607
00:41:14,792 --> 00:41:15,584
ND... -Hsu Taiyu!

608
00:41:17,792 --> 00:41:20,459
(Report stray dogs to have them caught.)

609
00:41:20,584 --> 00:41:22,584
It seems like he's really caught...

610
00:41:24,501 --> 00:41:27,584
I looked for her everywhere...

611
00:41:31,501 --> 00:41:32,792
Maybe she's just taken back by her owner.

612
00:41:35,667 --> 00:41:37,251
Who's on duty today?

613
00:41:38,209 --> 00:41:40,251
Clean it up!

614
00:41:40,376 --> 00:41:41,251
You have no respect for your teacher...

615
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:42,501
Stand up.

616
00:41:45,626 --> 00:41:46,751
No need.

617
00:41:48,709 --> 00:41:51,417
Who did this?

618
00:41:53,376 --> 00:41:56,667
Cursing others with this silly stuff!

619
00:42:04,459 --> 00:42:05,292
Come to my office and turn yourself in.

620
00:42:05,709 --> 00:42:06,667
Excuse me.

621
00:42:08,667 --> 00:42:10,584
You should at least take exams.

622
00:42:11,667 --> 00:42:14,292
You don't remember what I said?

623
00:42:14,417 --> 00:42:17,834
I got an anonymous letter saying you did it.

624
00:42:18,501 --> 00:42:19,459
You know.

625
00:42:19,792 --> 00:42:20,792
I remain unmarried for so many years,

626
00:42:20,917 --> 00:42:22,042
devoting myself to you...

627
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:22,459
I mean...

628
00:42:22,584 --> 00:42:23,626
to the school.

629
00:42:23,751 --> 00:42:25,751
Can't you just do me a favor?

630
00:42:26,626 --> 00:42:27,542
It's ok.

631
00:42:27,667 --> 00:42:29,042
Tell me the truth...

632
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:30,626
I'm very understanding.

633
00:42:32,792 --> 00:42:34,251
Listen...

634
00:42:34,376 --> 00:42:36,459
If I find out that you're lying to me later,

635
00:42:36,584 --> 00:42:38,084
I'll have no choice but to punish you.

636
00:42:38,209 --> 00:42:39,584
I know who wrote it.

637
00:42:39,709 --> 00:42:40,417
Wrote what?

638
00:42:43,376 --> 00:42:44,459
Hsu Taiyu.

639
00:42:45,251 --> 00:42:46,209
You...

640
00:42:49,417 --> 00:42:50,417
I wrote it.

641
00:42:51,876 --> 00:42:53,167
Very good.

642
00:42:54,542 --> 00:42:55,376
Miss Lin.

643
00:42:55,501 --> 00:42:56,667
You can go now.

644
00:42:58,167 --> 00:42:59,167
Thank you.

645
00:43:03,334 --> 00:43:04,709
I knew it!

646
00:43:04,834 --> 00:43:05,626
Hsu Taiyu.

647
00:43:05,751 --> 00:43:08,626
I really wish it's not you again.

648
00:43:08,751 --> 00:43:09,459
Hsu Taiyu.

649
00:43:09,584 --> 00:43:11,292
How can you leave in the middle of my talk?

650
00:43:11,417 --> 00:43:12,084
Ms. Chen

651
00:43:12,209 --> 00:43:12,584
Let me punish him first.

652
00:43:12,709 --> 00:43:13,626
Mr. Wang, I haven't finished yet.

653
00:43:13,751 --> 00:43:14,417
Let me scold him first.

654
00:43:14,542 --> 00:43:15,709
It's not a matter of...

655
00:43:15,834 --> 00:43:18,376
No, I was in the middle of scolding him.

656
00:43:18,501 --> 00:43:19,667
One thing at one time.

657
00:43:19,792 --> 00:43:20,667
Don't rush.

658
00:43:21,376 --> 00:43:22,417
You first.

659
00:43:22,542 --> 00:43:23,292
OK.

660
00:43:23,417 --> 00:43:24,459
Hsu Taiyu.

661
00:43:24,917 --> 00:43:26,584
Why do you think the school still took you in

662
00:43:26,709 --> 00:43:28,792
even though it's your last year
in high school?

663
00:43:29,292 --> 00:43:32,334
Because you were in science honors class.

664
00:43:32,459 --> 00:43:34,834
Even attended
Science Olympiad competition.

665
00:43:34,959 --> 00:43:36,626
What happened to you?

666
00:43:39,417 --> 00:43:40,834
Have you heard of
"The Tortoise and the Hare"?

667
00:43:40,959 --> 00:43:43,376
And "Eradicating the Three Scourges"

668
00:43:43,751 --> 00:43:45,251
Do you know who's "Zhou Chu"?

669
00:43:45,792 --> 00:43:46,667
Yeah.

670
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:49,876
It's pronounced "Chu" not "Choo"...

671
00:43:57,376 --> 00:43:58,542
Thank you.

672
00:43:58,667 --> 00:44:00,042
You...

673
00:44:00,167 --> 00:44:02,292
really didn't have to do that.

674
00:44:03,251 --> 00:44:04,709
That's what a friend is for.

675
00:44:04,834 --> 00:44:05,792
It does me no harm anyway.

676
00:44:12,292 --> 00:44:13,834
One chain letter to me...

677
00:44:13,959 --> 00:44:15,501
One to "Asshole"...

678
00:44:15,626 --> 00:44:17,209
Two others taken away by me...

679
00:44:17,667 --> 00:44:19,209
Who got the last one?

680
00:44:23,834 --> 00:44:25,501
Tao Minmin...

681
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:28,292
I really regret for it.

682
00:44:28,876 --> 00:44:29,751
That's why...

683
00:44:29,876 --> 00:44:31,917
You should work hard to get her!

684
00:44:32,792 --> 00:44:34,667
Girls like her must have had

685
00:44:34,792 --> 00:44:36,292
enough of compliments.

686
00:44:36,584 --> 00:44:38,042
Why not write bad things about her

687
00:44:38,167 --> 00:44:39,334
to get her attention?

688
00:44:39,584 --> 00:44:40,792
For example...

689
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:42,167
Thick waist...

690
00:44:42,459 --> 00:44:43,376
Huge butt...

691
00:44:43,584 --> 00:44:45,167
So fake when she talks...

692
00:44:46,209 --> 00:44:47,042
You sure?

693
00:44:47,167 --> 00:44:47,876
Yeah.

694
00:44:48,667 --> 00:44:50,251
And conclude it with...

695
00:44:50,584 --> 00:44:51,751
But still...

696
00:44:52,251 --> 00:44:53,584
I like you a lot.

697
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:13,376
Hey.

698
00:45:13,501 --> 00:45:15,501
Don't quote lyrics if you have no good idea.

699
00:45:15,626 --> 00:45:17,751
You can quote foreign poets' work.

700
00:45:19,167 --> 00:45:19,751
Who's gonna understand it?

701
00:45:19,876 --> 00:45:23,209
That's why it'll make you look mysterious.

702
00:45:23,334 --> 00:45:24,292
You sure?

703
00:45:24,792 --> 00:45:25,917
Sure.

704
00:45:26,334 --> 00:45:27,459
Let me tell you.

705
00:45:27,584 --> 00:45:30,167
Girls are so difficult to understand.

706
00:45:30,292 --> 00:45:32,584
When we say nothing's wrong...

707
00:45:32,709 --> 00:45:33,959
it means something's wrong.

708
00:45:34,459 --> 00:45:37,042
When we say it's ok,

709
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:38,334
it means it's not ok.

710
00:45:39,167 --> 00:45:40,459
If we say...

711
00:45:40,584 --> 00:45:42,167
I am fat...

712
00:45:42,584 --> 00:45:44,709
That means we hope you can tell us...

713
00:45:44,834 --> 00:45:46,584
You're not fat at all.

714
00:45:48,709 --> 00:45:49,459
That's the way...

715
00:45:49,584 --> 00:45:50,709

00:46:46,167 --> 00:46:46,584
What?

728
00:46:46,709 --> 00:46:48,626
Did you watch the Bulls vs. Lakers game?

729
00:46:48,751 --> 00:46:49,917
Of course.

730
00:46:50,417 --> 00:46:51,709
Shit, what a dramatic victory.

750
00:48:10,751 --> 00:48:12,167
That was the last time

751
00:48:12,542 --> 00:48:14,334
I saw Hsu Taiyu,

752
00:48:15,251 --> 00:48:16,792
before he transferred to First High.

753
00:48:17,584 --> 00:48:20,959
He became someone I don't know.

754
00:48:50,334 --> 00:48:51,459
Why don't we meet at Ice Palace,

755
00:48:51,584 --> 00:48:52,584
but here?

756
00:48:53,542 --> 00:48:54,751
You feel embarrassed?

757
00:48:56,209 --> 00:48:57,334
Hsu Taiyu.

758
00:48:57,792 --> 00:48:58,917
Let's have a race.

759
00:48:59,459 --> 00:49:01,251
The winner can make a request.

760
00:49:01,376 --> 00:49:02,834
Whoever crosses that line first wins.

761
00:49:50,584 --> 00:49:51,792
You can never beat me.

762
00:49:57,709 --> 00:49:59,542
Stop or you'll kill yourself.

763
00:50:24,167 --> 00:50:25,459
What's wrong with you?

764
00:50:33,334 --> 00:50:35,334
When you saw me in the pool the other day,

765
00:50:36,334 --> 00:50:38,667
were you afraid that I'd die like Su-yuan,

766
00:50:38,792 --> 00:50:40,209
in front of your eyes.

767
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:46,167
Ouyang told me everything.

768
00:50:46,667 --> 00:50:47,626
None of your business.

769
00:50:50,959 --> 00:50:52,751
Who are you to shout at me?

770
00:50:52,876 --> 00:50:55,042
Who are you to hurt yourself like this?

771
00:50:55,167 --> 00:50:56,792
It's also not easy for Ouyang, ok?

772
00:50:56,917 --> 00:50:57,834
Ma Suyuan must be pissed off

773
00:50:57,959 --> 00:50:59,667
to see the way you are now.

774
00:50:59,792 --> 00:51:01,376
Don't make me beat you!

775
00:51:10,459 --> 00:51:11,584
Hsu Taiyu.

776
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:28,751
Hsu Taiyu.

777
00:51:29,584 --> 00:51:30,959
If I could do it over again,

778
00:51:31,709 --> 00:51:33,626
I'd still have a race with you.

779
00:51:35,376 --> 00:51:36,459
If A-yuan could do it over again,

780
00:51:36,584 --> 00:51:38,209
he'd still go into the sea.

781
00:51:39,667 --> 00:51:41,167
But it's our own decision.

782
00:51:41,292 --> 00:51:42,876
Not your responsibility.

783
00:52:16,709 --> 00:52:17,626
Hsu Taiyu.

784
00:52:17,751 --> 00:52:19,334
You agreed that

785
00:52:21,167 --> 00:52:24,167
the winner can make a request.

786
00:52:28,501 --> 00:52:29,459
What do you want?

787
00:52:33,376 --> 00:52:34,751
Can you...

788
00:52:35,709 --> 00:52:37,167
be that Hsu Taiyu again?

789
00:53:53,501 --> 00:53:54,334
Stand up!

790
00:54:05,792 --> 00:54:06,709
A...attention.

791
00:54:07,792 --> 00:54:10,584
Good morning, sir.

792
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:15,667
Shut up!

793
00:54:19,917 --> 00:54:21,501
Hsu Taiyu.

794
00:54:21,959 --> 00:54:22,792
Do you...

795
00:54:24,376 --> 00:54:25,584
have any question?

796
00:54:25,917 --> 00:54:26,917
Yes.

797
00:54:28,501 --> 00:54:29,417
Which page are we at today?

798
00:54:36,209 --> 00:54:39,834
Chapter 7 on page 125.

799
00:54:40,834 --> 00:54:42,667
World War 2.

800
00:54:44,876 --> 00:54:46,167
Hsu...

801
00:54:46,751 --> 00:54:48,542
You have

802
00:54:50,376 --> 00:54:51,709
geography textbook in your hand.

803
00:54:58,334 --> 00:54:59,084
Chapter 7.

804
00:54:59,209 --> 00:55:00,334
Page 125.

805
00:55:00,459 --> 00:55:01,584
Take your textbook out!

806
00:55:09,167 --> 00:55:09,751
Those who don't have it...

807
00:55:09,876 --> 00:55:11,376
go and sit next to those who do.

808
00:55:51,959 --> 00:55:53,251
Am I cute?

809
00:56:20,959 --> 00:56:22,167
Wow!

810
00:56:23,584 --> 00:56:24,334
Miss.

811
00:56:24,459 --> 00:56:25,709
You look familiar...

812
00:56:27,834 --> 00:56:29,626
You are my high school...

813
00:56:29,751 --> 00:56:30,792
teacher.

814
00:56:32,626 --> 00:56:33,751
What's wrong with you today?

815
00:56:33,876 --> 00:56:34,917
Going to temple festival?

816
00:56:35,626 --> 00:56:36,292
Not really.

817
00:56:36,417 --> 00:56:37,417
I...

818
00:56:39,584 --> 00:56:40,584
Hurry up!

819
00:56:40,709 --> 00:56:42,626
We need to secure our seats at McDonald's!

820
00:56:42,751 --> 00:56:43,917
Temple festival is this way...

821
00:57:03,584 --> 00:57:04,501
Look at that guy...

822
00:57:04,626 --> 00:57:06,251
So cute... -Look, it's him...

823
00:57:06,376 --> 00:57:06,959
so tall.

824
00:57:07,251 --> 00:57:08,167
So cute...

825
00:57:24,501 --> 00:57:25,584
You idiot.

826
00:57:25,834 --> 00:57:27,334
Look where you're going.

827
00:57:38,042 --> 00:57:39,376
You got a hole in your brain?

828
00:57:39,501 --> 00:57:40,417
It's fine.

829
00:57:40,834 --> 00:57:41,792
Let's look for a seat first

830
00:57:41,917 --> 00:57:43,042
and order later.

831
00:57:43,167 --> 00:57:43,917
You're gonna help me.

832
00:57:44,042 --> 00:57:44,459
OK.

833
00:57:44,501 --> 00:57:45,542
Here's what you ordered.

834
00:57:45,667 --> 00:57:45,834
Thanks.

835
00:57:45,959 --> 00:57:46,876
Have a nice meal.

836
00:57:47,292 --> 00:57:48,126
Hello! Welcome!

837
00:57:48,251 --> 00:57:49,126
What would you like to order?

838
00:57:51,376 --> 00:57:52,584
Hsu Taiyu.

839
00:57:53,542 --> 00:57:55,084
He's studying there.

840
00:57:55,209 --> 00:57:57,709
It seems like he really changed.

841
00:57:59,376 --> 00:58:00,459
Maybe he's here...

842
00:58:00,584 --> 00:58:03,292
because you come here often.

843
00:58:05,209 --> 00:58:06,792
Let's go... -what?

844
00:58:07,584 --> 00:58:09,042
Hey, she wants to talk to you.

845
00:58:09,167 --> 00:58:10,584
I'll find us a table.

846
00:58:12,334 --> 00:58:13,251
That seat is...

847
00:58:13,376 --> 00:58:14,417
Hsu...

848
00:58:15,417 --> 00:58:17,501
I heard you were in science honors class...

849
00:58:18,292 --> 00:58:19,667
If that's the case,

850
00:58:19,792 --> 00:58:21,542
you should never give up.

851
00:58:22,251 --> 00:58:23,667
If there's something you don't understand,

852
00:58:23,792 --> 00:58:24,834
I can help you with it.

853
00:58:26,167 --> 00:58:26,667
Thanks.

854
00:58:27,792 --> 00:58:29,626
You asked me to give you my personal info.

855
00:58:29,751 --> 00:58:30,751
You'll have it.

856
00:58:31,584 --> 00:58:32,792
But...

857
00:58:33,876 --> 00:58:35,959
Don't mistake "Disney" for "Destiny" again.

858
00:58:40,209 --> 00:58:41,501
Why "Destiny"?

859
00:58:42,417 --> 00:58:43,709
Disney is my pseudonym.

860
00:58:51,959 --> 00:58:54,792
What...were you...talking about?

861
00:58:56,209 --> 00:58:58,459
Nothing. They wanted to share the table.

862
00:59:00,834 --> 00:59:01,917
Study.

863
00:59:12,917 --> 00:59:15,167
<i>Hsu Taiyu started to study hard.</i>

864
00:59:15,792 --> 00:59:16,876
<i>Very hard.</i>

865
00:59:17,751 --> 00:59:20,959
<i>Although I think it's because I woke him up,</i>

866
00:59:22,251 --> 00:59:23,501
<i>the truth is...</i>

867
00:59:23,959 --> 00:59:25,459
<i>he did it for Minmin.</i>

868
00:59:25,667 --> 00:59:26,626
<i>He wants to get into top 10</i>

869
00:59:26,751 --> 00:59:28,667
<i>in the coming mock exam.</i>

870
00:59:29,792 --> 00:59:30,917
Hsu Taiyu.

871
00:59:31,709 --> 00:59:34,167
Did he come to see you?

872
00:59:37,626 --> 00:59:39,209
Back then...

873
00:59:39,584 --> 00:59:40,084
if a girl

874
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:42,292
was willing to give you her personal info,

875
00:59:42,584 --> 00:59:43,459
that means...

876
00:59:43,584 --> 00:59:46,209
she didn't dislike you at all.

877
00:59:46,334 --> 00:59:49,251
<i>(The person I like:)</i>

878
00:59:53,751 --> 00:59:56,209
Latest version of sample exams, good luck.

879
00:59:56,501 --> 00:59:57,084
Thank you.

880
00:59:57,209 --> 00:59:58,917
Thank you.

881
01:00:04,751 --> 01:00:05,626
Ah.

882
01:00:07,251 --> 01:00:09,167
It's my hubby.

883
01:00:10,709 --> 01:00:11,751
When I grow up.

884
01:00:11,876 --> 01:00:14,751
I will go to Taipei for your concert...

885
01:00:15,292 --> 01:00:16,709
A piece of cake.

886
01:00:17,417 --> 01:00:18,917
One day I'll ask Andy Lau

887
01:00:19,417 --> 01:00:20,376
to sing for you.

888
01:00:21,751 --> 01:00:22,834
Really?

889
01:00:23,417 --> 01:00:24,334
Yeah right.

890
01:00:24,459 --> 01:00:25,626
Hey! Don't touch it!

891
01:00:26,459 --> 01:00:27,209
Let's go.

892
01:00:32,417 --> 01:00:33,167
Let's go.

893
01:00:38,167 --> 01:00:40,334
If we add the two together...

894
01:00:40,459 --> 01:00:41,417
Idiot.

895
01:00:41,834 --> 01:00:46,376
sin^2(x) + cos^2(x) = 1

896
01:00:46,917 --> 01:00:48,667
No exception.

897
01:00:49,376 --> 01:00:50,334
What?

898
01:00:57,417 --> 01:00:58,584
Look behind you.

899
01:00:59,792 --> 01:01:03,167
Wow...when did Truly become so serious?

900
01:01:03,792 --> 01:01:05,751
Something's wrong with Boss...hehe.

901
01:01:20,792 --> 01:01:23,251
I live just down there.

902
01:01:23,626 --> 01:01:25,084
It's quite late.

903
01:01:25,209 --> 01:01:26,501
You should go home now.

904
01:01:27,334 --> 01:01:28,167
Oh...

905
01:01:28,959 --> 01:01:30,292
It's ok.

906
01:01:30,542 --> 01:01:31,542
If I linger a bit,

907
01:01:31,834 --> 01:01:32,959
I might run into Tao Minmin.

908
01:01:35,751 --> 01:01:36,792
Oh...

909
01:01:39,209 --> 01:01:40,167
By the way.

910
01:01:40,417 --> 01:01:43,376
ND already learned to pee at the same spot.

911
01:01:44,501 --> 01:01:45,709
Thank God...

912
01:01:46,167 --> 01:01:47,751
she didn't grow into an idiot like you.

913
01:02:06,292 --> 01:02:07,667
For me?

914
01:02:10,792 --> 01:02:12,459
I planned to give it to Tao Minmin.

915
01:02:12,584 --> 01:02:15,251
But it's so ugly and it's Andy Lau...

916
01:02:15,917 --> 01:02:17,376
better give it to you.

917
01:02:24,792 --> 01:02:25,667
Hey...

918
01:02:25,792 --> 01:02:27,209
tell me, for guys...

919
01:02:27,709 --> 01:02:31,334
what's the definition of pretty girls?

920
01:02:32,376 --> 01:02:35,417
You mean what kind of girls Ouyang likes?

921
01:02:37,876 --> 01:02:38,751
Whatever.

922
01:02:38,876 --> 01:02:40,167
Anything.

923
01:02:42,584 --> 01:02:44,376
He was crazy about Vivian Chow before.

924
01:02:46,542 --> 01:02:47,792
What about you?

925
01:02:49,959 --> 01:02:52,167
Uchida Yuki is not bad.

926
01:02:52,417 --> 01:02:53,417
Sakai Noriko also.

927
01:02:54,501 --> 01:02:55,792
Both Japanese?

928
01:02:56,417 --> 01:02:57,334
Yes.

929
01:03:01,459 --> 01:03:03,542
I want to learn roller skating.

930
01:03:04,251 --> 01:03:05,626
Why so sudden?

931
01:03:06,417 --> 01:03:07,667
Because...

932
01:03:08,417 --> 01:03:10,709
Ouyang says he likes roller skating.

933
01:03:11,417 --> 01:03:14,251
You're pretty good...can you teach me?

934
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:16,667
Sure.

935
01:03:31,167 --> 01:03:32,167
I want this.

936
01:03:32,501 --> 01:03:33,792
Hello, Mr. Tang.

937
01:03:53,292 --> 01:03:56,251
Should I ask my bro to come down?

938
01:04:08,292 --> 01:04:10,584
Where can I get the same look as yours?

939
01:04:13,667 --> 01:04:15,542
Go to hell and get reborn will be easier.

940
01:04:19,584 --> 01:04:21,709
Lin Truly, are you hitting puberty?

941
01:04:21,834 --> 01:04:23,376
Don't be so mean.

942
01:04:24,292 --> 01:04:26,584
It's normal for girls to care their looks.

943
01:04:27,667 --> 01:04:28,792
Let me help you.

944
01:04:30,376 --> 01:04:31,959
Thank you sis.

945
01:04:34,501 --> 01:04:35,584
Are you alright?

946
01:04:36,584 --> 01:04:39,417
Yeah, sprained my ankle, that's all.

947
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:41,417
Just need to ice it a bit.

948
01:04:42,626 --> 01:04:46,167
Ouyang got injured. Does Truly know?

949
01:04:46,292 --> 01:04:47,126
I don't know...

950
01:04:47,251 --> 01:04:49,584
Let's tell her when she's here.

951
01:04:50,917 --> 01:04:52,167
Hey hey.

952
01:04:52,542 --> 01:04:55,292
Are you close friends of Ouyang's?

953
01:04:58,167 --> 01:04:59,084
Ouyang!

954
01:04:59,209 --> 01:05:00,792
Chiayi, you... -Calm down.

955
01:05:01,376 --> 01:05:02,917
Are you alright?

956
01:05:03,667 --> 01:05:04,709
Yeah.

957
01:05:56,792 --> 01:05:58,751
Wow it swells so much.

958
01:05:58,876 --> 01:06:01,251
No way, we must heat it.

959
01:06:01,709 --> 01:06:03,084
Ice it.

960
01:06:03,209 --> 01:06:06,501
Heat it! Were you there in health class?

961
01:06:17,417 --> 01:06:18,334
Hey...

962
01:06:18,459 --> 01:06:21,084
I always ice with this when I'm injured.

963
01:06:21,209 --> 01:06:22,501
Convenient and tasty.

964
01:06:25,334 --> 01:06:26,251
Thanks.

965
01:06:26,376 --> 01:06:27,959
Guess I don't have to visit health center.

966
01:06:30,584 --> 01:06:32,167
I'll go back to class now.

967
01:06:39,751 --> 01:06:41,792
You look cute today.

968
01:06:42,167 --> 01:06:43,501
The hairstyle suits you.

969
01:06:44,167 --> 01:06:45,376
Good luck with your exam.

970
01:06:48,209 --> 01:06:49,667
Wow!

971
01:06:49,792 --> 01:06:51,209
So cute.

972
01:06:51,334 --> 01:06:53,917
Lin Truly, you are so pretty.

973
01:06:54,542 --> 01:06:56,042
I want to look like you!

974
01:06:56,167 --> 01:06:57,626
He said you're cute!

975
01:06:57,751 --> 01:06:59,626
Did you put on makeup?

976
01:07:08,376 --> 01:07:10,334
<i>Hsu Taiyu got 10th place in the mock exam</i>

977
01:07:10,459 --> 01:07:12,834
<i>among all 3rd year students.</i>

978
01:07:12,959 --> 01:07:15,126
<i>While the whole school was still in shock,</i>

979
01:07:15,251 --> 01:07:16,959
<i>the new director arrived.</i>

980
01:07:20,459 --> 01:07:21,626
Littering.

981
01:07:22,959 --> 01:07:24,542
Which eye of yours saw that I littered?

982
01:07:24,667 --> 01:07:26,209
You are the litter.

983
01:07:26,667 --> 01:07:28,209
Director Chuan said...

984
01:07:28,334 --> 01:07:30,084
Everyone in class 317...

985
01:07:30,209 --> 01:07:31,792
is a piece of shit.

986
01:07:34,376 --> 01:07:35,501
Fuck! What the hell!

987
01:07:36,959 --> 01:07:39,376
School regulation says "no hair coloring".

988
01:07:39,501 --> 01:07:42,334
The new director hates people
who break the rules.

989
01:07:45,626 --> 01:07:46,417
Excuse me.

990
01:08:02,584 --> 01:08:04,376
Hsu Taiyu from class 317.

991
01:08:05,792 --> 01:08:07,501
Finally.

992
01:08:08,584 --> 01:08:11,209
You'd better be good until you graduate.

993
01:08:11,834 --> 01:08:13,667
Otherwise I'll kick you out of the school

994
01:08:14,376 --> 01:08:16,042
once you're cited with 3 serious demerits.

995
01:08:16,167 --> 01:08:17,292
As you wish.

996
01:08:21,751 --> 01:08:23,376
I'll do my best.

997
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:26,751
Because people like you

998
01:08:27,584 --> 01:08:30,584
do not deserve education at all.

999
01:08:54,792 --> 01:08:55,959
Stand up.

1000
01:09:00,834 --> 01:09:03,209
Who got first place in the exam this time?

1001
01:09:03,334 --> 01:09:04,167
Please stand up.

1002
01:09:14,251 --> 01:09:16,167
Let's give him a big hand.

1003
01:09:22,584 --> 01:09:23,667
Good job.

1004
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:25,792
So good that I have to ask Hsu...

1005
01:09:26,584 --> 01:09:29,626
how did you cheat in the exam?

1006
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:33,876
I asked people to give you a big hand

1007
01:09:34,376 --> 01:09:36,876
to see if you know what is shame!

1008
01:09:40,626 --> 01:09:42,626
You just talked, stand up!

1009
01:09:45,376 --> 01:09:46,251
Sir.

1010
01:09:46,376 --> 01:09:47,042
I didn't talk.

1011
01:09:47,167 --> 01:09:49,251
I have eyes to judge that.

1012
01:09:50,417 --> 01:09:52,251
Did you help him...

1013
01:09:53,209 --> 01:09:55,459
in the exam?

1014
01:09:58,292 --> 01:10:00,417
Can someone come forward and testify that

1015
01:10:00,709 --> 01:10:02,209
Hsu Taiyu cheated.

1016
01:10:05,251 --> 01:10:07,209
No one wants to tell the truth, huh?

1017
01:10:08,751 --> 01:10:09,834
Now...

1018
01:10:10,792 --> 01:10:12,834
All of you, go to the running track.

1019
01:10:12,959 --> 01:10:13,751
Stand up!

1020
01:10:15,376 --> 01:10:16,292
I know you dislike me...

1021
01:10:16,417 --> 01:10:17,584
but it has nothing to do with them!

1022
01:10:17,709 --> 01:10:18,667
Leave them alone.

1023
01:10:18,792 --> 01:10:19,542
Fine.

1024
01:10:20,376 --> 01:10:21,584
Want to play the hero?

1025
01:10:23,542 --> 01:10:25,667
I'll leave all 50 rounds to you.

1026
01:10:25,792 --> 01:10:27,167
Run to your heart's content.

1027
01:10:41,584 --> 01:10:43,584
Director Chuan must be sick. So strict.

1028
01:10:43,709 --> 01:10:46,376
Demerit for skirts above the knees.

1029
01:10:46,501 --> 01:10:48,167
A lap is 400 meters!

1030
01:10:48,584 --> 01:10:51,251
I heard that Hsu already finished 35 rounds.

1031
01:11:00,167 --> 01:11:01,501
I heard that he cheated in the exam

1032
01:11:01,626 --> 01:11:02,709
and started a battle with the director.

1033
01:11:02,834 --> 01:11:04,417
He's punished to run 50 rounds.

1034
01:11:04,542 --> 01:11:05,917
He's not that kind of person.

1035
01:11:06,459 --> 01:11:08,417
Minmin, Chiayi is bullshiting.

1036
01:11:09,167 --> 01:11:10,459
Lin Truly...

1037
01:11:11,709 --> 01:11:12,834
Hsu Taiyu.

1038
01:11:12,959 --> 01:11:14,792
Why don't you tell the truth?

1039
01:11:16,792 --> 01:11:18,209
Hsu Taiyu!

1040
01:11:26,626 --> 01:11:27,834
Excuse me.

1041
01:11:28,501 --> 01:11:29,501
Director.

1042
01:11:29,626 --> 01:11:31,459
Hsu Taiyu really didn't cheat.

1043
01:11:31,584 --> 01:11:32,626
I can testify for him.

1044
01:11:32,751 --> 01:11:34,084
He really studied very hard.

1045
01:11:34,209 --> 01:11:37,251
You should stay away from people like him.

1046
01:11:38,376 --> 01:11:39,334
Tell him,

1047
01:11:39,542 --> 01:11:41,834
if he can't finish, 1 more demerit for him.

1048
01:11:41,959 --> 01:11:43,751
Plus one-week suspension from school.

1049
01:11:44,417 --> 01:11:45,834
Let him reflect on himself at home.

1050
01:12:10,917 --> 01:12:12,792
How's your boss doing?

1051
01:12:13,376 --> 01:12:14,542
Dunno...

1052
01:12:14,959 --> 01:12:16,834
He doesn't answer on his pager.

1053
01:12:17,751 --> 01:12:19,501
I heard that the school festival next week

1054
01:12:19,792 --> 01:12:21,459
might be cancelled by the director.

1055
01:12:21,792 --> 01:12:24,667
He said we students don't study enough.

1056
01:12:25,167 --> 01:12:26,584
What the fuck is he thinking!

1057
01:12:26,709 --> 01:12:28,417
Students also deserve human rights!

1058
01:12:28,542 --> 01:12:30,667
The authority shouldn't let him bully us!

1059
01:12:33,292 --> 01:12:34,584
Of course not!

1060
01:12:38,167 --> 01:12:39,376
We'll let the authority hear our voice

1061
01:12:39,876 --> 01:12:41,584
at the school festival next week.

1062
01:12:41,709 --> 01:12:44,167
Let him know he can't do whatever he likes.

1063
01:12:44,292 --> 01:12:45,251
Let's do it!

1064
01:13:05,167 --> 01:13:06,417
Sorry.

1065
01:13:09,376 --> 01:13:11,501
Please stand up for our rights -Please.

1066
01:13:11,626 --> 01:13:13,751
Please, the revolt needs your support.

1067
01:13:13,876 --> 01:13:15,709
The revolt needs your support.

1068
01:13:15,834 --> 01:13:17,834
Please have a look...

1069
01:13:18,876 --> 01:13:20,584
Please, please have a look.

1070
01:13:20,709 --> 01:13:21,667
Please support First High's revolt.

1071
01:13:21,792 --> 01:13:23,542
Please support First High's revolt.

1072
01:13:24,376 --> 01:13:26,292
Please, please have a look.

1073
01:13:27,542 --> 01:13:28,542
We really really

1074
01:13:28,667 --> 01:13:30,584
need your support.

1075
01:13:33,792 --> 01:13:34,792
Don't take it.

1076
01:13:34,917 --> 01:13:37,376
You're done if the director knows.

1077
01:13:45,751 --> 01:13:46,792
Leave it to me.

1078
01:13:49,876 --> 01:13:52,542
Hand it out over there. You, there.

1079
01:14:09,334 --> 01:14:11,042
You're openly instigating others to revolt,

1080
01:14:11,167 --> 01:14:12,459
violating the regulations,

1081
01:14:12,584 --> 01:14:13,459
humiliating your teachers.

1082
01:14:13,584 --> 01:14:16,959
Everyone who helped you
now has a demerit.

1083
01:14:17,542 --> 01:14:19,542
Do your parents know what you're doing?

1084
01:14:20,167 --> 01:14:21,459
You brought disgrace on your parents.

1085
01:14:21,584 --> 01:14:23,501
You brought shame on them.

1086
01:14:25,376 --> 01:14:27,834
The teacher said Hsu is a gangster.

1087
01:14:27,959 --> 01:14:30,917
He's not even allowed to go to school!

1088
01:14:31,501 --> 01:14:33,042
You completely destroyed my reputation.

1089
01:14:33,167 --> 01:14:34,834
You...go upstairs and write your confession.

1090
01:14:34,959 --> 01:14:36,292
You're grounded for two days.

1091
01:14:36,417 --> 01:14:37,626
Now!

1092
01:14:42,251 --> 01:14:43,459
How embarrassing.

1093
01:14:43,584 --> 01:14:45,792
I was scolded by the teacher on the phone.

1094
01:14:45,917 --> 01:14:46,876
I...

1095
01:14:47,709 --> 01:14:49,251
Hello? -This is Truly's cram school.

1096
01:14:49,376 --> 01:14:50,876
Lin Truly is busy now.

1097
01:14:52,376 --> 01:14:53,334
Hey...

1098
01:14:53,751 --> 01:14:55,167
It's a guy...

1099
01:14:56,667 --> 01:14:57,626
Hello?

1100
01:14:57,959 --> 01:14:59,084
It's you again!

1101
01:14:59,209 --> 01:15:00,792
Never call again!

1102
01:15:04,459 --> 01:15:06,667
You are so rude.

1103
01:15:07,876 --> 01:15:08,834
If he calls again, let me pick it up.

1104
01:15:08,959 --> 01:15:10,167
Must be him.

1105
01:15:10,292 --> 01:15:11,584
Pretending to be cram school staff.

1106
01:15:16,584 --> 01:15:17,667
Lin Truly.

1107
01:15:18,542 --> 01:15:20,417
Don't call me these two days.

1108
01:15:20,542 --> 01:15:21,417
What's wrong?

1109
01:15:21,542 --> 01:15:22,334
What happened?

1110
01:15:22,459 --> 01:15:24,417
Nothing's wrong. Bye.

1111
01:15:59,959 --> 01:16:01,334
Are you ok?

1112
01:16:03,251 --> 01:16:05,584
It's so late...you must be going to bed?

1113
01:16:11,334 --> 01:16:13,209
I'm just stopping by.

1114
01:16:25,417 --> 01:16:26,376
Well...

1115
01:16:28,417 --> 01:16:29,626
I'm leaving then.

1116
01:16:30,376 --> 01:16:31,584
Hold on.

1117
01:16:38,626 --> 01:16:39,709
ND.

1118
01:16:44,542 --> 01:16:45,792
ND.

1119
01:16:53,876 --> 01:16:55,167
Are you alright?

1120
01:16:56,667 --> 01:16:59,042
Never knew I can be suspended
from school.

1121
01:16:59,167 --> 01:17:00,251
Feels awesome.

1122
01:17:02,251 --> 01:17:04,376
I mean...you passed out at school...

1123
01:17:06,751 --> 01:17:07,626
It's just heat stroke.

1124
01:17:07,751 --> 01:17:08,792
Nothing fatal.

1125
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:20,376
Why are you suddenly grounded?

1126
01:17:22,792 --> 01:17:26,376
Anyone can be grounded for knowing you,
ok?

1127
01:17:30,917 --> 01:17:32,584
What brought you here?

1128
01:17:32,959 --> 01:17:33,917
Because you said...

1129
01:17:35,542 --> 01:17:38,167
When a girl says "I'm ok", she's not ok.

1130
01:17:38,459 --> 01:17:40,876
Nothing's wrong means something's wrong.

1131
01:17:47,251 --> 01:17:48,584
Do you want to come to a place with me?

1132
01:17:49,667 --> 01:17:50,584
What?

1133
01:17:58,376 --> 01:17:59,876
Wait here.

1134
01:18:25,542 --> 01:18:27,042
Since I discovered this place,

1135
01:18:27,167 --> 01:18:28,917
I've been coming here at midnight a lot.

1136
01:18:32,584 --> 01:18:34,251
You want to learn roller skating, right?

1137
01:18:43,376 --> 01:18:45,501
Let me tell you how not to fall.

1138
01:18:46,334 --> 01:18:47,542
What's the tip?

1139
01:18:48,459 --> 01:18:49,459
Don't...

1140
01:18:49,584 --> 01:18:51,251
be afraid of falling.

1141
01:19:07,751 --> 01:19:09,417
It can't get worse than falling.

1142
01:19:10,167 --> 01:19:11,417
The important thing is...

1143
01:19:11,542 --> 01:19:12,834
why are you here.

1144
01:19:23,626 --> 01:19:24,792
Thank you.

1145
01:19:25,751 --> 01:19:26,709
What?

1146
01:20:09,376 --> 01:20:10,626
On the day of school festival,

1147
01:20:11,334 --> 01:20:12,667
let's give out awards to the top 10 students

1148
01:20:12,792 --> 01:20:15,792

01:20:27,584 --> 01:20:28,292

Class 302, Yang Chiaying.

1155
01:20:30,709 --> 01:20:31,459

1156
01:20:31,584 --> 01:20:33,459

Class 301, Lin Bingsheng.

1161
01:20:43,501 --> 01:20:44,251
7th place.

1162
01:20:44,376 --> 01:20:46,542
Class 309, Chen Yuting.

1163
01:20:47,792 --> 01:20:48,501
8th place.

1164
01:20:48,626 --> 01:20:50,709
Class 306, Li Chengfu.

1165
01:20:50,834 --> 01:20:51,584
It's coming...

1166
01:20:51,709 --> 01:20:52,626
9th place.

1167
01:20:52,751 --> 01:20:55,376
Class 303, Wang Aiwei.

1168
01:20:57,792 --> 01:20:58,876
Get ready. Get ready.

1169
01:21:02,626 --> 01:21:04,501
Up to the stage, now!

1170
01:21:04,626 --> 01:21:06,584
Please come up to the stage.

1171
01:21:09,876 --> 01:21:11,667
You might be wondering...

1172
01:21:11,792 --> 01:21:13,459
why there are only 9 of them.

1173
01:21:14,501 --> 01:21:15,584
Because...

1174
01:21:16,376 --> 01:21:19,542
the school denounces cheating in exams.

1175
01:21:20,292 --> 01:21:23,209
We human beings
must have a sense of shame.

1176
01:21:24,459 --> 01:21:25,542
You should never think those sneaky,

1177
01:21:25,667 --> 01:21:27,042
shameful behavior of yours

1178
01:21:27,167 --> 01:21:28,667
will not be found out.

1179
01:21:29,792 --> 01:21:33,292
Hsu of Class 317, I'm talking about YOU.

1180
01:21:34,376 --> 01:21:35,167
What rubbish?

1181
01:21:36,584 --> 01:21:37,792
Mind your own business!

1182
01:21:53,792 --> 01:21:54,751
Sir.

1183
01:22:10,584 --> 01:22:12,084
We're giving out awards now,

1184
01:22:12,209 --> 01:22:14,459
if you want to talk, we'll...

1185
01:22:14,584 --> 01:22:15,417
Director.

1186
01:22:16,209 --> 01:22:19,167
I have something serious to report now.

1187
01:22:19,834 --> 01:22:22,667
My skirt is 3cm higher than my knee.

1188
01:22:22,792 --> 01:22:24,417
My socks are not 100% white.

1189
01:22:24,542 --> 01:22:27,292
My jacket's zipper never pulled high enough.

1190
01:22:27,417 --> 01:22:28,042
Please punish me, sir.

1191
01:22:28,167 --> 01:22:29,751
All these are not important now.

1192
01:22:31,917 --> 01:22:34,251
We'll take our time to punish her later.

1193
01:22:35,417 --> 01:22:36,751
If none of these rules is important,

1194
01:22:36,876 --> 01:22:38,584
why should we follow them?

1195
01:22:39,876 --> 01:22:40,834
Therefore,

1196
01:22:41,292 --> 01:22:42,709
please cite me with an admonition

1197
01:22:43,584 --> 01:22:44,959
according to school regulations.

1198
01:23:02,501 --> 01:23:03,584
Director.

1199
01:23:04,209 --> 01:23:05,251
I cheated in exams.

1200
01:23:08,542 --> 01:23:11,667
Please cite me with a major demerit

1201
01:23:11,792 --> 01:23:13,251
according to school regulations.

1202
01:23:13,376 --> 01:23:14,376
Ouyang.

1203
01:23:14,792 --> 01:23:16,751
Don't play with your future.

1204
01:23:16,876 --> 01:23:18,834
You're applying for Taiwan University,

1205
01:23:18,959 --> 01:23:20,334
Your discipline record can't be affected.

1206
01:23:20,459 --> 01:23:21,584
Besides, we know very well. You're smart.

1207
01:23:21,709 --> 01:23:22,667
It's not possible that you...

1208
01:23:22,792 --> 01:23:24,376
Why not?

1209
01:23:24,751 --> 01:23:26,584
If Director Chuan can say that Hsu Taiyu

1210
01:23:26,709 --> 01:23:28,459
of Class 317 cheated on the exam,

1211
01:23:28,584 --> 01:23:29,584
I can say I did it.

1212
01:23:29,709 --> 01:23:31,167
And what I say counts.

1213
01:23:31,542 --> 01:23:32,584
Alright.

1214
01:23:33,917 --> 01:23:36,792
Since Ouyang confessed his crime bravely,

1215
01:23:36,917 --> 01:23:39,501
I'll make sure he gets a major demerit.

1216
01:23:42,584 --> 01:23:43,376
Director Chuan...

1217
01:23:43,501 --> 01:23:45,084
We need further discussion.

1218
01:23:45,209 --> 01:23:46,084
Principal, Ouyang just...

1219
01:23:46,209 --> 01:23:47,626
Director.

1220
01:23:48,209 --> 01:23:50,251
I'm in shorts while it's not a P.E. class.

1221
01:23:50,376 --> 01:23:51,792
Please cite me with an admonition.

1222
01:23:54,501 --> 01:23:55,792
Director.

1223
01:23:56,667 --> 01:23:58,667
You're my chocolate.

1224
01:23:59,709 --> 01:24:01,417
I'm disrespectful to teachers.

1225
01:24:01,542 --> 01:24:02,876
Please cite me with an admonition.

1226
01:24:06,167 --> 01:24:07,376
Director.

1227
01:24:07,834 --> 01:24:09,542
I spread obscene ideas.

1228
01:24:09,667 --> 01:24:11,584
Please cite me with a minor demerit.

1229
01:24:15,167 --> 01:24:16,459
Director.

1230
01:24:16,834 --> 01:24:18,376
Eat shit!

1231
01:24:23,584 --> 01:24:26,126
Sorry I humiliated teachers.

1232
01:24:26,251 --> 01:24:28,167
Please cite me with a major demerit.

1233
01:24:30,792 --> 01:24:31,667
Director.

1234
01:24:31,792 --> 01:24:33,376
I... I have a girlfriend.

1235
01:24:33,626 --> 01:24:35,584
Bullshit.

1236
01:24:37,376 --> 01:24:38,501
Director.

1237
01:24:40,459 --> 01:24:41,876
I brought my pager to school.

1238
01:24:43,209 --> 01:24:44,667
Please cite me with an admonition.

1239
01:24:46,376 --> 01:24:47,417
Director.

1240
01:24:47,542 --> 01:24:49,376
I didn't flush the toilet.

1241
01:24:49,917 --> 01:24:50,751
Director.

1242
01:24:51,376 --> 01:24:52,626
I'm not wearing underpants.

1243
01:24:53,251 --> 01:24:54,459
I play Game Boy in class.

1244
01:24:54,584 --> 01:24:55,584
I sleep in class...

1245
01:24:55,709 --> 01:24:57,459
I have a boyfriend...

1246
01:25:18,417 --> 01:25:19,376
Director.

1247
01:25:20,376 --> 01:25:22,376
You said students should be like students.

1248
01:25:23,334 --> 01:25:24,584
But neither exams nor school regulations

1249
01:25:24,709 --> 01:25:26,376
can define us.

1250
01:25:26,626 --> 01:25:29,417
Those with good scores can make mistakes.

1251
01:25:29,626 --> 01:25:32,542
Those who made a mistake can improve.

1252
01:25:32,792 --> 01:25:35,501
Whether we're good or bad is not up to you.

1253
01:25:35,917 --> 01:25:37,667
Only we know who we are.

1254
01:25:38,501 --> 01:25:40,792
Only we can decide the way we are.

1255
01:25:50,251 --> 01:25:50,959
Alright. Alright.

1256
01:25:51,417 --> 01:25:52,834
Calm down everyone.

1257
01:25:53,376 --> 01:25:57,751
Today is the 54th anniversary of our school.

1258
01:25:58,334 --> 01:26:02,376
First High is always a liberal school.

1259
01:26:02,751 --> 01:26:04,834
I'm here to promise you that, we'll discuss,

1260
01:26:05,251 --> 01:26:08,792
improve ourselves and proceed accordingly.

1261
01:26:17,167 --> 01:26:21,167
The long-waited water balloon fight

1262
01:26:21,292 --> 01:26:23,626
officially starts now.

1263
01:26:41,376 --> 01:26:43,917
<i>We didn't know until years later...</i>

1264
01:26:44,501 --> 01:26:46,876
<i>the first person you throw your balloon at,</i>

1265
01:26:47,501 --> 01:26:48,959
<i>is not someone you dislike,</i>

1266
01:26:49,751 --> 01:26:53,584
<i>but someone you can't take your eyes off.</i>

1267
01:27:43,959 --> 01:27:45,834
Hey! You meant it.

1268
01:27:45,959 --> 01:27:46,751
That's not true.

1269
01:27:46,876 --> 01:27:49,376
Just to wait for Dahe and Small.

1270
01:27:52,584 --> 01:27:53,792
Are you tired?

1271
01:28:07,292 --> 01:28:08,834
Just to keep your hands warm.

1272
01:28:20,542 --> 01:28:22,417
I picked your key.

1273
01:28:22,751 --> 01:28:24,251
We must be meant for each other, right?

1274
01:28:24,376 --> 01:28:25,542
Meant for hell.

1275
01:28:27,917 --> 01:28:28,792
You're going so slow on purpose...

1276
01:28:28,917 --> 01:28:31,292
is it because you want us to be alone?

1277
01:28:33,751 --> 01:28:34,834
Boss...

1278
01:28:34,959 --> 01:28:36,834
Sakuraki...wait for me!

1279
01:29:01,959 --> 01:29:03,417
Follow the beat!

1280
01:29:05,834 --> 01:29:08,751
Truth or Dare.

1281
01:29:14,334 --> 01:29:15,626
Ouyang...

1282
01:29:17,167 --> 01:29:18,292
Are you seeing someone?

1283
01:29:18,501 --> 01:29:19,792
Is she here?

1284
01:29:23,584 --> 01:29:24,667
Yes, she's here.

1285
01:29:24,792 --> 01:29:28,292
Wow! Mr. Straight-A confessed his love.

1286
01:29:33,167 --> 01:29:35,292
Boss, boss.

1287
01:29:35,417 --> 01:29:37,501
So...are you seeing someone? ls she here?

1288
01:29:37,626 --> 01:29:38,667
Is she here?

1289
01:29:38,792 --> 01:29:40,459
Yes, she's here.

1290
01:29:44,584 --> 01:29:45,126
Who's that?

1291
01:29:45,251 --> 01:29:46,459
Boss, tell me...please.

1292
01:29:46,584 --> 01:29:47,501
Hurry up...

1293
01:29:48,876 --> 01:29:51,542
Oh...Lin Truly.

1294
01:29:52,917 --> 01:29:54,376
Are you seeing someone?

1295
01:29:54,501 --> 01:29:55,792
Is he here?

1296
01:30:12,626 --> 01:30:15,501
Hold on.

1297
01:30:16,251 --> 01:30:17,417
Is this bottle...

1298
01:30:17,542 --> 01:30:19,376
pointing closer to Tao Minmin?

1299
01:30:19,501 --> 01:30:20,167
Boss.

1300
01:30:20,292 --> 01:30:21,251
Ask again. Ask again.

1301
01:30:21,376 --> 01:30:22,042
Tao Minmin.

1302
01:30:22,167 --> 01:30:23,792
Ask again. Ask again.

1303
01:30:23,917 --> 01:30:27,584
Minmin, Minmin.

1304
01:30:27,709 --> 01:30:29,334
Have you ever sent out chain letters?

1305
01:30:35,917 --> 01:30:37,459
What the hell is that?

1306
01:30:37,584 --> 01:30:39,376
Drink it.

1307
01:30:41,334 --> 01:30:42,542
How did you know that Minmin sent me

1308
01:30:42,667 --> 01:30:46,334
the chain letter and reported me?

1309
01:30:47,834 --> 01:30:50,251
Who knows that
you're sending chain letters?

1310
01:30:50,876 --> 01:30:52,792
Must be the person who sent it to you.

1311
01:30:54,709 --> 01:30:58,334
Tao Minmin received exactly the same letter

1312
01:30:58,584 --> 01:31:00,334
she sent out. That's why she knows

1313
01:31:00,751 --> 01:31:02,792
one of the classmates who received

1314
01:31:02,917 --> 01:31:04,667
her letter sent it to the teacher.

1315
01:31:06,501 --> 01:31:08,417
I guess you're the only one who knows

1316
01:31:09,376 --> 01:31:11,959
Wang Baidan among the 5 receivers.

1317
01:31:17,334 --> 01:31:18,209
I never thought

1318
01:31:18,334 --> 01:31:20,126
she would do something like this.

1319
01:31:20,251 --> 01:31:22,792
I thought she was perfect.

1320
01:31:24,459 --> 01:31:26,542
Now I think your personality is better.

1321
01:31:29,251 --> 01:31:30,584
And if I look closely...

1322
01:31:30,709 --> 01:31:32,501
she's not that much prettier than you.

1323
01:31:34,834 --> 01:31:36,834
Maybe just this much prettier.

1324
01:32:02,251 --> 01:32:03,917
Which university do you want to go to?

1325
01:32:06,626 --> 01:32:07,876
Taiwan University, I guess.

1326
01:32:08,417 --> 01:32:09,584
And you?

1327
01:32:10,834 --> 01:32:12,751
Same for me.

1328
01:32:14,917 --> 01:32:17,584
But...I don't think I can get in.

1329
01:32:21,626 --> 01:32:23,167
Hsu Taiyu.

1330
01:32:25,167 --> 01:32:26,251
If...

1331
01:32:26,751 --> 01:32:28,834
we end up going to different universities,

1332
01:32:29,542 --> 01:32:31,376
can you promise me?

1333
01:32:34,792 --> 01:32:36,126
That...

1334
01:32:36,251 --> 01:32:39,792
you'll continue to study hard and graduate.

1335
01:32:41,376 --> 01:32:42,667
That you'll never fight again...

1336
01:32:44,959 --> 01:32:46,292
That you'll never...

1337
01:32:46,417 --> 01:32:48,501
worry people who care about you.

1338
01:32:57,334 --> 01:32:57,959
Ok.

1339
01:32:58,584 --> 01:32:59,917
I promise you.

1340
01:33:04,584 --> 01:33:05,751
What about you?

1341
01:33:05,959 --> 01:33:06,959
Yes?

1342
01:33:11,376 --> 01:33:17,792
If I go to somewhere very far from you,

1343
01:33:18,667 --> 01:33:20,209
can you promise me?

1344
01:33:28,292 --> 01:33:30,459
That sesame dressing and noodles

1345
01:33:30,584 --> 01:33:31,792
will never be mixed together.

1346
01:33:33,167 --> 01:33:34,334
Not funny.

1347
01:33:35,542 --> 01:33:37,167
I'm serious.

1348
01:33:42,917 --> 01:33:43,626
Hsu Taiyu.

1349
01:33:43,751 --> 01:33:44,917
Shooting star!

1350
01:33:45,792 --> 01:33:46,542
Make a wish.

1351
01:33:57,542 --> 01:34:00,751
<i>Chain letters can never bring good luck.</i>

1352
01:34:01,667 --> 01:34:03,417
<i>But on that night,</i>

1353
01:34:04,334 --> 01:34:05,709
<i>I felt...</i>

1354
01:34:06,292 --> 01:34:08,167
<i>I found my luck.</i>

1355
01:34:32,459 --> 01:34:33,376
<i>Welcome to the</i>

1356
01:34:33,501 --> 01:34:35,126
<i>"Superstitious Show".</i>

1357
01:34:35,251 --> 01:34:37,334
Mom! It's starting!

1358
01:34:37,959 --> 01:34:39,626
<i>Let's have a look at this weird picture.</i>

1359
01:34:39,751 --> 01:34:41,709
<i>A group of high school students went</i>

1360
01:34:41,834 --> 01:34:43,334
<i>camping last month and took this photo.</i>

1361
01:34:43,459 --> 01:34:45,501
<i>Let's hear what the expert has to say.</i>

1362
01:34:45,626 --> 01:34:47,751
<i>The student in the photo</i>

1363
01:34:47,876 --> 01:34:51,167
<i>became translucent.</i>

1364
01:34:52,251 --> 01:34:55,667
<i>If we look at the supernatural aspect of it,</i>

1365
01:34:55,792 --> 01:34:58,417
<i>it's obvious that</i>

1366
01:34:58,792 --> 01:35:00,209
<i>this photo</i>

1367
01:35:00,334 --> 01:35:02,876
<i>is full of supernatural energy.</i>

1368
01:35:04,292 --> 01:35:06,251
<i>I suggest the student</i>

1369
01:35:06,376 --> 01:35:09,626
<i>visit temples guarding land and underworld</i>

1370
01:35:09,751 --> 01:35:11,251
<i>to remove ill fortune.</i> -Go home soon.

1371
01:35:11,376 --> 01:35:12,667
Take care.

1372
01:35:13,376 --> 01:35:14,459
Thanks.

1373
01:35:30,959 --> 01:35:32,376
Hsu Taiyu.

1374
01:35:33,167 --> 01:35:34,292
I finally...

1375
01:35:34,709 --> 01:35:36,334
got you.

1376
01:35:44,584 --> 01:35:45,751
The bell has rung.

1377
01:35:45,876 --> 01:35:47,167
Hand in your paper.

1378
01:35:56,376 --> 01:35:57,626
Sakuraki said that

1379
01:35:57,751 --> 01:36:00,251
Hsu hasn't come to school for a week.

1380
01:36:00,376 --> 01:36:02,376
He's even absent from the mock exam.

1381
01:36:02,834 --> 01:36:05,417
Did you watch the TV show last week?

1382
01:36:05,542 --> 01:36:07,792
Maybe something really happened to him?

1383
01:36:07,917 --> 01:36:09,459
I don't think so.

1384
01:36:47,917 --> 01:36:49,167
Hsu Taiyu.

1385
01:36:54,709 --> 01:36:56,417
Why didn't you take the mock exam?

1386
01:36:56,542 --> 01:36:57,792
None of your business.

1387
01:37:00,209 --> 01:37:02,376
Why did you...fight again?

1388
01:37:02,501 --> 01:37:03,667
For no reason.

1389
01:37:05,292 --> 01:37:06,334
They wanted to fight.

1390
01:37:06,626 --> 01:37:07,876
So I fought with them.

1391
01:37:14,584 --> 01:37:15,792
Hsu Taiyu.

1392
01:37:17,792 --> 01:37:19,626
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

1393
01:37:29,209 --> 01:37:30,751
<i>When a girl says</i>

1394
01:37:30,876 --> 01:37:33,334
<i>"nothing's wrong",
something must be wrong.</i>

1395
01:37:33,459 --> 01:37:35,959
<i>"I'm ok" means "I'm not ok."</i>

1396
01:37:37,251 --> 01:37:38,042
<i>We didn't know until</i>

1397
01:37:38,167 --> 01:37:39,542
<i>long after that:</i>

1398
01:37:40,251 --> 01:37:42,084
<i>when a girl says</i>

1399
01:37:42,209 --> 01:37:43,751
<i>"I don't want to talk to you anymore."</i>

1400
01:37:44,251 --> 01:37:45,917
<i>She doesn't really hate you.</i>

1401
01:37:46,626 --> 01:37:48,584
<i>Instead she cares about you...</i>

1402
01:37:49,667 --> 01:37:50,751
<i>very</i>

1403
01:37:51,251 --> 01:37:52,792
<i>very much.</i>

1404
01:38:29,876 --> 01:38:31,376
Happy birthday!

1405
01:38:35,376 --> 01:38:36,584
Thank you...

1406
01:38:37,417 --> 01:38:38,584
This is...

1407
01:38:39,167 --> 01:38:40,667
Boss brought it back himself.

1408
01:38:41,167 --> 01:38:42,709
We don't know what he's been busy with,

1409
01:38:43,376 --> 01:38:45,584
but he still remembers your birthday.

1410
01:38:45,917 --> 01:38:47,376
And this!

1411
01:38:47,792 --> 01:38:49,209
Boss said that you shouldn't listen to it

1412
01:38:49,334 --> 01:38:51,209
before the university entrance exam.

1413
01:38:52,209 --> 01:38:53,667
There must be something special in it.

1414
01:38:58,167 --> 01:38:59,751
When you see boss in school tomorrow,

1415
01:39:00,834 --> 01:39:02,667
don't forget to thank him.

1416
01:39:04,376 --> 01:39:05,501
Bye bye.

1417
01:39:18,751 --> 01:39:19,542
Lin Truly.

1418
01:39:19,667 --> 01:39:23,626
Today's your birthday, let's go to...

1419
01:39:23,751 --> 01:39:24,709
Chicken House...

1420
01:39:24,834 --> 01:39:27,084
Great! Hand-shredded chicken set for me.

1421
01:39:27,209 --> 01:39:28,626
I'm gonna have two.

1422
01:39:30,459 --> 01:39:31,417
Look! It's Hsu Taiyu.

1423
01:39:31,542 --> 01:39:32,542
Who is he looking for?

1424
01:39:32,667 --> 01:39:33,334
Hsu Taiyu.

1425
01:39:35,709 --> 01:39:37,292
Lin Truly...

1426
01:39:37,417 --> 01:39:38,584
go go go.

1427
01:39:38,834 --> 01:39:41,584
He came to see you, Lin Truly.

1428
01:39:42,209 --> 01:39:43,626
Happy birthday...

1429
01:39:45,209 --> 01:39:46,709
So romantic!

1430
01:40:14,542 --> 01:40:15,084
Last night...

1431
01:40:15,209 --> 01:40:16,167
Thank you.

1432
01:40:16,501 --> 01:40:18,167
Oh. You're welcome.

1433
01:40:18,542 --> 01:40:19,792
Did you like it?

1434
01:40:20,334 --> 01:40:22,167
Of course!

1435
01:40:23,376 --> 01:40:24,501
Happy birthday.

1436
01:40:26,959 --> 01:40:29,959
What did you want to say?

1437
01:40:30,626 --> 01:40:32,251
Small and Meimei are waiting for me.

1438
01:40:32,376 --> 01:40:34,501
We're discussing where to go for dinner.

1439
01:40:36,709 --> 01:40:37,792
Do you want to join us?

1440
01:40:39,417 --> 01:40:40,667
By the way.

1441
01:40:41,292 --> 01:40:43,084
Please write this for me.

1442
01:40:43,209 --> 01:40:44,459
Make sure you...

1443
01:40:45,542 --> 01:40:46,417
fill in your personal info

1444
01:40:46,542 --> 01:40:48,167
like the sample on page 1.

1445
01:40:51,376 --> 01:40:51,876
What's wrong?

1446
01:40:52,376 --> 01:40:53,251
Taiyu...

1447
01:41:01,376 --> 01:41:02,376
Were you looking for me?

1448
01:41:02,501 --> 01:41:03,709
For what?

1449
01:41:15,709 --> 01:41:16,792
Wait for me here.

1450
01:41:27,167 --> 01:41:28,834
So you came for Minmin?

1451
01:41:30,542 --> 01:41:31,959
You should've told me...

1452
01:41:36,501 --> 01:41:37,459
you came for Minmin to...

1453
01:41:37,584 --> 01:41:38,792
She told me she likes me.

1454
01:41:52,501 --> 01:41:54,167
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

1455
01:41:55,917 --> 01:41:57,792
Hmmm...congratulations.

1456
01:41:58,459 --> 01:41:59,584
What a surprise!

1457
01:41:59,709 --> 01:42:01,667
I even helped you chase her for so long.

1458
01:42:03,209 --> 01:42:04,251
Congratulations.

1459
01:42:04,876 --> 01:42:06,167
Finally.

1460
01:42:06,459 --> 01:42:07,667
Thank you.

1461
01:42:10,376 --> 01:42:11,584
It'll definitely work out

1462
01:42:11,709 --> 01:42:12,917
between Ouyang and you.

1463
01:42:14,584 --> 01:42:15,667
Good luck.

1464
01:42:21,417 --> 01:42:22,376
Thanks.

1465
01:42:23,792 --> 01:42:26,167
I'm...really happy for you.

1466
01:42:40,334 --> 01:42:41,584
It's pouring rain...

1467
01:42:45,584 --> 01:42:46,751
Goodbye.

1468
01:42:48,626 --> 01:42:49,917
Come with us...

1469
01:42:54,376 --> 01:42:56,167
It's ok. Thanks.

1470
01:43:53,709 --> 01:43:55,626
Look! It says that

1471
01:43:55,751 --> 01:43:57,751
Andy Lau has a girlfriend!

1472
01:43:57,876 --> 01:44:00,834
What? It must be rumor.

1473
01:44:00,959 --> 01:44:03,751
Andy Lau will never get married.

1474
01:44:04,751 --> 01:44:07,292
<i>We all dreamed of marrying our idols,</i>

1475
01:44:07,417 --> 01:44:08,542
That must be a rumor.

1476
01:44:08,667 --> 01:44:10,251
<i>But in reality...</i>

1477
01:44:11,209 --> 01:44:13,751
<i>Of course
Andy Lau belongs to someone else.</i>

1478
01:44:15,209 --> 01:44:16,667
<i>Same for our first love.</i>

1479
01:44:17,209 --> 01:44:19,792
<i>Of course we can't beat girls like Minmin.</i>

1480
01:44:32,001 --> 01:44:33,001
Morning.

1481
01:44:34,626 --> 01:44:35,959
Don't cry.

1482
01:44:36,292 --> 01:44:37,042
Morning.

1483
01:44:37,584 --> 01:44:39,334
Going abroad as soon as he got you.

1484
01:44:39,459 --> 01:44:41,251
He was just fooling you.

1485
01:44:41,876 --> 01:44:42,751
In the end...

1486
01:44:42,876 --> 01:44:45,334
we shouldn't have trusted a freak who

1487
01:44:45,459 --> 01:44:47,167
separates sesame dressing from noodles.

1488
01:45:59,251 --> 01:46:00,584
I heard that Director Chuan

1489
01:46:00,917 --> 01:46:03,251
caught him fighting with others

1490
01:46:03,376 --> 01:46:04,417
and wanted to kick him out of the school.

1491
01:46:04,542 --> 01:46:06,542
That's why his dad sent him abroad.

1492
01:46:06,959 --> 01:46:07,834
What? Really?

1493
01:46:07,959 --> 01:46:08,917
Shhh...

1494
01:46:09,542 --> 01:46:10,792
Quiet. Here she comes.

1495
01:46:12,417 --> 01:46:13,751
What are you talking about?

1496
01:46:13,876 --> 01:46:15,376
We are here to study.

1497
01:46:15,792 --> 01:46:17,376
Yes -Right.

1498
01:46:20,209 --> 01:46:22,542
<i>Back then, there was no facebook.</i>

1499
01:46:23,584 --> 01:46:25,209
<i>12,000km means</i>

1500
01:46:25,626 --> 01:46:27,417
<i>parting for good.</i>

1501
01:46:29,584 --> 01:46:31,251
<i>But sometimes</i>

1502
01:46:31,376 --> 01:46:32,876
<i>there were some moments,</i>

1503
01:46:33,501 --> 01:46:34,626
<i>I felt he would appear</i>

1504
01:46:34,751 --> 01:46:36,209
<i>the next second.</i>

1505
01:46:37,167 --> 01:46:38,042
Are you ok?

1506
01:46:38,167 --> 01:46:39,292
Be careful.

1507
01:46:41,667 --> 01:46:42,876
This is the ultimate note.

1508
01:46:43,709 --> 01:46:44,626
Let's go roller skating

1509
01:46:44,751 --> 01:46:46,251
after you finish the exam.

1510
01:46:46,376 --> 01:46:47,459
Or...

1511
01:46:47,751 --> 01:46:49,042
do you want to go to the movies?

1512
01:46:49,167 --> 01:46:51,667
Ah! Stephen Chow's
”Monkey King” is on again.

1513
01:46:51,792 --> 01:46:53,251
I want to watch it again.

1514
01:46:53,626 --> 01:46:54,501
Last time...

1515
01:46:54,626 --> 01:46:55,584
I didn't quite get it.

1516
01:47:05,376 --> 01:47:06,792
<i>Hsu Taiyu left.</i>

1517
01:47:07,792 --> 01:47:09,251
<i>My life</i>

1518
01:47:09,376 --> 01:47:11,792
<i>seemed to be back to the same old.</i>

1519
01:47:13,584 --> 01:47:14,834
<i>But I know</i>

1520
01:47:15,626 --> 01:47:16,792
<i>because of him</i>

1521
01:47:17,792 --> 01:47:19,251
<i>I am...</i>

1522
01:47:19,876 --> 01:47:21,084
<i>who I am now.</i>

1523
01:47:21,209 --> 01:47:24,542
<i>(To: Lin Truly)</i>

1524
01:47:25,001 --> 01:47:25,459
OK.

1525
01:47:28,709 --> 01:47:30,376
<i>(You're pretty. Can I be your friend?)</i>

1526
01:47:30,501 --> 01:47:31,667
Congratulations.

1527
01:47:31,792 --> 01:47:33,376
Finally done with the entrance exam.

1528
01:47:35,292 --> 01:47:36,376
Thanks.

1529
01:47:36,876 --> 01:47:37,792
I think...

1530
01:47:37,917 --> 01:47:39,459
I did pretty well in math.

1531
01:47:40,167 --> 01:47:41,751
Thanks for the ultimate note.

1532
01:47:44,751 --> 01:47:46,209
Did you...

1533
01:47:46,751 --> 01:47:47,959
listen to the tape?

1534
01:47:48,709 --> 01:47:50,584
The one Taiyu gave you.

1535
01:47:58,792 --> 01:47:59,917
I promised him

1536
01:48:00,459 --> 01:48:02,167
to remind you of this.

1537
01:48:02,959 --> 01:48:04,459
It's a shame that

1538
01:48:05,417 --> 01:48:06,417
the ending

1539
01:48:06,917 --> 01:48:08,209
isn't like what he thought.

1540
01:48:10,792 --> 01:48:12,334
Hsu Taiyu! Shooting star!

1541
01:48:12,459 --> 01:48:13,501
Make a wish!

1542
01:48:22,334 --> 01:48:24,459
You know that I heard it, right?

1543
01:48:25,584 --> 01:48:27,251
The person you like...

1544
01:48:28,709 --> 01:48:29,792
is here.

1545
01:48:37,959 --> 01:48:39,167
In the beginning,

1546
01:48:39,542 --> 01:48:42,209
I thought whoever believed in chain letters

1547
01:48:42,792 --> 01:48:44,667
was either an idiot

1548
01:48:44,792 --> 01:48:46,292
or an idiot.

1549
01:48:47,542 --> 01:48:48,459
But later I realized that

1550
01:48:48,584 --> 01:48:50,584
she's simply a very kind person.

1551
01:48:50,709 --> 01:48:52,042
To whoever received this:

1552
01:48:52,167 --> 01:48:53,042
I am really really sorry.

1553
01:48:53,167 --> 01:48:55,126
I was forced to send it...

1554
01:48:55,251 --> 01:48:56,626
You might be hit by a car,

1555
01:48:56,751 --> 01:48:57,667
get cancer...

1556
01:48:57,792 --> 01:48:59,584
or...lose your family.

1557
01:48:59,709 --> 01:49:00,334
But...

1558
01:49:00,459 --> 01:49:01,709
I'm sure you'll turn ill luck into good,

1559
01:49:01,834 --> 01:49:02,626
have a successful life,

1560
01:49:02,751 --> 01:49:03,751
become wealthy.

1561
01:49:06,334 --> 01:49:07,501
That's why I wanted to know her.

1562
01:49:07,626 --> 01:49:09,376
Let's be friends.

1563
01:49:09,501 --> 01:49:10,751
I was serious.

1564
01:49:11,667 --> 01:49:12,501
What?

1565
01:49:12,876 --> 01:49:14,542
I thought chasing girls...

1566
01:49:14,667 --> 01:49:16,042
was that simple.

1567
01:49:16,167 --> 01:49:17,459
Tao Minmin.

1568
01:49:17,584 --> 01:49:18,251
Wanna be my gal?

1569
01:49:18,376 --> 01:49:21,209
Say yes! Say yes!

1570
01:49:27,459 --> 01:49:28,834
Later I realized...

1571
01:49:29,501 --> 01:49:31,501
if you really like someone...

1572
01:49:33,167 --> 01:49:34,417
you might not even notice it.

1573
01:49:36,959 --> 01:49:39,417
I was actually super nervous that day.

1574
01:49:41,876 --> 01:49:43,376
I have to thank that car.

1575
01:49:43,626 --> 01:49:45,626
The moment I held her in my arm...

1576
01:49:45,751 --> 01:49:47,251
I realized that I never knew...

1577
01:49:47,584 --> 01:49:50,167
my heart...can beat so fast.

1578
01:49:53,417 --> 01:49:56,209
What...were you...talking about?

1579
01:49:56,376 --> 01:49:59,542
I didn't want her to misunderstand.

1580
01:50:00,251 --> 01:50:01,792
But somehow...

1581
01:50:02,376 --> 01:50:04,042
at the end of that day

1582
01:50:04,167 --> 01:50:05,709
she didn't seem happy.

1583
01:50:08,542 --> 01:50:10,292
When you like someone

1584
01:50:11,626 --> 01:50:15,459
and see her walk to someone she likes,

1585
01:50:16,542 --> 01:50:18,209
you'd suddenly realize that

1586
01:50:19,584 --> 01:50:20,751
you treat her badly just because

1587
01:50:23,792 --> 01:50:26,667
you want to get a bit closer to her.

1588
01:50:36,709 --> 01:50:37,792
For me?

1589
01:50:39,959 --> 01:50:41,626
You'll keep every word she said

1590
01:50:41,751 --> 01:50:43,459
in mind.

1591
01:50:44,376 --> 01:50:45,417
Nothing's wrong.

1592
01:50:45,834 --> 01:50:47,167
Bye.

1593
01:50:48,917 --> 01:50:51,209
When we say nothing's wrong...

1594
01:50:51,584 --> 01:50:52,542
it means something's wrong.

1595
01:50:52,667 --> 01:50:54,042
When we say it's ok,

1596
01:50:54,167 --> 01:50:55,417
it means it's not ok.

1597
01:51:01,167 --> 01:51:02,167
Are you ok?

1598
01:51:02,584 --> 01:51:04,251
I didn't know that when I'm in love,

1599
01:51:05,167 --> 01:51:06,751
I actually have no courage to tell her.

1600
01:51:08,876 --> 01:51:09,542
On that night,

1601
01:51:09,667 --> 01:51:11,292
I made a wish upon a shooting star.

1602
01:51:12,292 --> 01:51:13,917
I wish I was also

1603
01:51:14,334 --> 01:51:15,376
in her wish.

1604
01:51:16,792 --> 01:51:20,376
Even if I know it's someone else

1605
01:51:20,709 --> 01:51:21,959
who could make her happy...

1606
01:51:24,417 --> 01:51:27,667
Sometimes...she still pretends to be ok

1607
01:51:28,584 --> 01:51:30,167
even when she feels very sad.

1608
01:51:30,959 --> 01:51:32,751
Spending 5 minutes deciding what to have,

1609
01:51:33,792 --> 01:51:35,834
before choosing the same old raddish cake.

1610
01:51:37,834 --> 01:51:39,792
She doesn't watch where she's going.

1611
01:51:40,834 --> 01:51:43,459
Please watch her at all times.

1612
01:51:43,584 --> 01:51:44,459
Are you ok?

1613
01:51:45,209 --> 01:51:46,292
She wants to go to Taiwan University,

1614
01:51:46,417 --> 01:51:47,959
but she's really bad at math.

1615
01:51:49,834 --> 01:51:50,792
She likes roller skating,

1616
01:51:50,917 --> 01:51:52,334
loves Stephen Chow's films...

1617
01:51:52,459 --> 01:51:53,501
Let's go roller skating

1618
01:51:53,626 --> 01:51:54,667
after you finish the exam.

1619
01:51:55,209 --> 01:51:56,209
She...

1620
01:52:03,709 --> 01:52:05,167
likes you very much.

1621
01:52:07,751 --> 01:52:08,959
I didn't know that

1622
01:52:09,542 --> 01:52:10,792
he disappeared for so long

1623
01:52:11,417 --> 01:52:12,792
was because he had a surgery.

1624
01:52:32,292 --> 01:52:33,376
Do you see that?

1625
01:52:33,501 --> 01:52:35,584
You have a blood clot here.

1626
01:52:36,167 --> 01:52:38,459
This is why you passed out when running.

1627
01:52:38,584 --> 01:52:41,042
It might be caused by the car accident.

1628
01:52:41,167 --> 01:52:42,292
That sounds really bad!

1629
01:52:43,251 --> 01:52:45,876
Should've charged the driver more.

1630
01:52:46,584 --> 01:52:47,959
You really should.

1631
01:52:48,626 --> 01:52:49,751
You'll need a surgery

1632
01:52:49,876 --> 01:52:51,334
and stay in the hospital.

1633
01:52:51,459 --> 01:52:53,667
Your family has to come to look after you.

1634
01:52:55,876 --> 01:52:57,542
He wanted me to keep the secret.

1635
01:52:57,917 --> 01:52:58,792
I guess...

1636
01:52:59,376 --> 01:53:02,709
he didn't want you to blame yourself.

1637
01:53:04,167 --> 01:53:06,834
His family told the school long time ago

1638
01:53:06,959 --> 01:53:08,584
that they wanted to take him to the U.S..

1639
01:53:10,542 --> 01:53:11,626
Hsu Taiyu.

1640
01:53:12,501 --> 01:53:14,376
I hope you can start over again

1641
01:53:14,834 --> 01:53:16,626
after arriving in the U.S..

1642
01:53:17,626 --> 01:53:18,667
Director.

1643
01:53:21,417 --> 01:53:22,459
Thank you.

1644
01:53:23,667 --> 01:53:25,042
Sakuraki said that

1645
01:53:25,167 --> 01:53:27,542
Hsu hasn't come to school for a week.

1646
01:53:27,667 --> 01:53:29,709
He's even absent from the mock exam.

1647
01:53:31,292 --> 01:53:33,667
Aren't you moving to the U.S. soon?

1648
01:53:33,792 --> 01:53:34,792
Why are you still studying this?

1649
01:53:35,834 --> 01:53:37,167
Because...

1650
01:53:38,251 --> 01:53:39,376
I made a promise.

1651
01:53:39,751 --> 01:53:40,959
Can you...

1652
01:53:42,334 --> 01:53:43,542
be that Hsu Taiyu again?

1653
01:53:44,626 --> 01:53:46,792
Why did you...fight again?

1654
01:53:46,917 --> 01:53:48,167
For no reason.

1655
01:53:49,167 --> 01:53:50,459
They wanted to fight.

1656
01:53:50,584 --> 01:53:51,792
So I fought with them.

1657
01:53:59,501 --> 01:54:01,334
Sorry for coming here so late

1658
01:54:01,459 --> 01:54:03,251
and asking that standee for free.

1659
01:54:03,501 --> 01:54:04,376
Sorry.

1660
01:54:07,376 --> 01:54:08,626
Hsu Taiyu.

1661
01:54:09,459 --> 01:54:10,376
I finally

1662
01:54:11,209 --> 01:54:12,376
got you.

1663
01:54:12,792 --> 01:54:14,167
It's Andy Lau!

1664
01:54:15,542 --> 01:54:16,917
Don't you motherfucker dodge!

1665
01:54:17,501 --> 01:54:19,167
You want me to invite your gal for tea?

1666
01:54:19,626 --> 01:54:20,626
She always goes to

1667
01:54:20,917 --> 01:54:22,584
that teashop to study.

1668
01:54:22,917 --> 01:54:24,251
Class...

1669
01:54:24,376 --> 01:54:25,459
304...

1670
01:54:25,584 --> 01:54:27,626
Lin...Tru...ly...

1671
01:54:28,709 --> 01:54:29,792
Don't you ever touch her!

1672
01:54:29,917 --> 01:54:33,084
It depends on whether you're a good boy...

1673
01:54:33,209 --> 01:54:37,417
whether you let me beat you...up...

1674
01:55:37,501 --> 01:55:38,542
Lin Truly.

1675
01:55:40,792 --> 01:55:43,501
Now you're with the person you like, right?

1676
01:55:52,167 --> 01:55:53,584
I won Tao Minmin's heart.

1677
01:55:55,209 --> 01:55:56,459
You won Ouyang's.

1678
01:55:59,167 --> 01:56:00,376
We fulfilled the promise

1679
01:56:01,501 --> 01:56:03,792
we made in the beginning.

1680
01:56:05,792 --> 01:56:06,751
I guess...

1681
01:56:08,167 --> 01:56:10,417
this is the only

1682
01:56:11,334 --> 01:56:13,209
and the last thing I could do for you.

1683
01:56:15,584 --> 01:56:16,959
Lin Truly.

1684
01:56:19,459 --> 01:56:20,542
Although you're short

1685
01:56:21,292 --> 01:56:22,167
and stupid.

1686
01:56:24,709 --> 01:56:26,417
And you even like someone else.

1687
01:56:28,376 --> 01:56:29,626
Even so...

1688
01:56:31,376 --> 01:56:32,584
I still...

1689
01:56:38,584 --> 01:56:39,876
like you a lot.

1690
01:57:02,376 --> 01:57:03,584
Lin Truly.

1691
01:57:06,584 --> 01:57:08,751
If you already listened to the whole tape,

1692
01:57:11,542 --> 01:57:14,417
just look up at the sky.

1693
01:57:16,709 --> 01:57:18,876
Then I will know

1694
01:57:20,376 --> 01:57:22,626
I'm looking at the same starry sky

1695
01:57:24,542 --> 01:57:26,376
as the girl I like.

1696
01:57:29,792 --> 01:57:32,167
I Love You

1697
01:58:33,792 --> 01:58:37,167
<i>(The person I like: Hsu Taiyu)</i>

1698
01:58:48,417 --> 01:58:50,042
<i>You were always wondering...</i>

1699
01:58:50,167 --> 01:58:52,376
<i>what your future would be like.</i>

1700
01:58:52,834 --> 01:58:54,751
<i>Now... I can give you the answer.</i>

1701
01:58:59,209 --> 01:59:00,542
Give me the salary

1702
01:59:00,667 --> 01:59:02,042
and the holidays I deserve,

1703
01:59:02,167 --> 01:59:03,626
or let me quit.

1704
01:59:03,751 --> 01:59:07,251
I don't need to waste my life

1705
01:59:07,376 --> 01:59:08,876
in a place where no one cares who I am.

1706
01:59:19,292 --> 01:59:20,917
Truly! Truly!

1707
01:59:21,376 --> 01:59:22,584
What the fuck!

1708
01:59:22,709 --> 01:59:25,417
Handwritten resignation letter...so ancient.

1709
01:59:25,542 --> 01:59:26,792
We'd probably just send emails.

1710
01:59:26,917 --> 01:59:27,542
Who dares to

1711
01:59:27,667 --> 01:59:28,334
do this.

1712
01:59:28,459 --> 01:59:29,792
You're so cool.

1713
01:59:30,501 --> 01:59:31,417
Sometimes...

1714
01:59:31,542 --> 01:59:33,292
it's still way cooler to

1715
01:59:33,417 --> 01:59:34,459
do it our way.

1716
01:59:34,959 --> 01:59:35,667
By the way.

1717
01:59:35,792 --> 01:59:36,751
All of you have a share

1718
01:59:36,876 --> 01:59:37,709
of my performance bonus.

1719
01:59:37,834 --> 01:59:39,167
Yay!

1720
01:59:44,834 --> 01:59:46,334
So you quit?

1721
01:59:46,917 --> 01:59:48,751
How can you be so immature?

1722
01:59:49,376 --> 01:59:51,167
Why can't you just be flexible?

1723
01:59:51,459 --> 01:59:53,834
Everyone can stick to it, why can't you?

1724
01:59:55,209 --> 01:59:55,709
Do you remember that

1725
01:59:55,834 --> 01:59:57,417
once I asked you to pay card bill for me?

1726
01:59:57,542 --> 01:59:59,459
It's true I gave you the bill quite late.

1727
01:59:59,584 --> 02:00:00,042
But it doesn't mean you could...

1728
02:00:00,167 --> 02:00:00,751
<i>In the future...</i>

1729
02:00:00,876 --> 02:00:02,626
<i>you won't really become someone amazing.</i>

1730
02:00:02,959 --> 02:00:04,626
<i>You still make mistakes.</i>

1731
02:00:04,751 --> 02:00:06,167
<i>You still get confused.</i>

1732
02:00:06,792 --> 02:00:09,084
<i>You still regret for not having more ice,</i>

1733
02:00:09,209 --> 02:00:10,459
<i>or not experiencing more relationships.</i>

1734
02:00:10,584 --> 02:00:11,792
...that's what I don't like about you.

1735
02:00:11,917 --> 02:00:13,751
Same here.

1736
02:00:18,917 --> 02:00:20,417
Let's break up.

1737
02:00:21,667 --> 02:00:23,876
<i>...and being too kind to people you dislike.</i>

1738
02:00:24,292 --> 02:00:26,376
<i>And cherishing people you like more.</i>

1739
02:00:26,792 --> 02:00:28,042
<i>But...</i>

1740
02:00:28,167 --> 02:00:29,751
<i>the way you are is good.</i>

1741
02:00:30,584 --> 02:00:31,584
<i>You're still very brave,</i>

1742
02:00:31,709 --> 02:00:33,251
<i>very naive.</i>

1743
02:00:33,376 --> 02:00:34,459
<i>You still...</i>

1744
02:00:34,584 --> 02:00:36,084
<i>scream for your idol.</i>

1745
02:00:36,209 --> 02:00:38,209
Ah!

1746
02:00:42,709 --> 02:00:44,917
How can you stay so popular for 30 years?

1747
02:00:45,876 --> 02:00:49,792
How come I still can't get a single ticket!

1748
02:00:53,001 --> 02:00:53,959
Come on. Come on.

1749
02:00:54,084 --> 02:00:55,834
Truly glow stick!

1750
02:00:56,042 --> 02:00:57,251
See, I finally got the ticket.

1751
02:00:57,751 --> 02:00:58,167
Where?

1752
02:00:58,959 --> 02:01:00,709
I've queued for a long time!

1753
02:01:01,167 --> 02:01:02,876
I'm in the first row at the mosh pit.

1754
02:01:03,126 --> 02:01:06,001
Come on. Come on. Have a look.

1755
02:01:07,126 --> 02:01:09,334
Truly glow stick!

1756
02:01:10,042 --> 02:01:11,209
Come have a look.

1757
02:01:14,334 --> 02:01:15,459
Hello.

1758
02:01:15,584 --> 02:01:16,292
May I help you?

1759
02:01:16,417 --> 02:01:17,459
Kumquat lemonade, please.

1760
02:01:17,584 --> 02:01:18,751
No problem.

1761
02:01:18,876 --> 02:01:20,167
30 dollars.

1762
02:01:31,834 --> 02:01:33,042
Hello.

1763
02:01:33,167 --> 02:01:33,792
Bubble milk tea.

1764
02:01:33,917 --> 02:01:35,417
Bubble milk tea? Sure.

1765
02:01:35,542 --> 02:01:37,167
It's gonna take some time.

1766
02:01:43,751 --> 02:01:45,376
You dropped something.

1767
02:01:53,251 --> 02:01:54,459
I'm taking a break.

1768
02:01:54,917 --> 02:01:57,251
Just treat me as an ordinary person.

1769
02:01:59,542 --> 02:02:00,751
Don't worry.

1770
02:02:01,584 --> 02:02:03,501
I think you're so ordinary.

1771
02:02:04,167 --> 02:02:05,042
I don't like you at all.

1772
02:02:05,167 --> 02:02:06,709
I'm not your fan.

1773
02:02:15,167 --> 02:02:16,834
This is...what my colleague...

1774
02:02:16,959 --> 02:02:17,667
helped me...

1775
02:02:17,792 --> 02:02:19,667
download earlier today.

1776
02:02:20,334 --> 02:02:21,626
So good.

1777
02:02:21,751 --> 02:02:23,542
I...don't know who's the singer...

1778
02:02:24,167 --> 02:02:24,667
I agree.

1779
02:02:24,792 --> 02:02:25,542
It's good.

1780
02:02:26,584 --> 02:02:28,251
Let me play another song.

1781
02:02:37,501 --> 02:02:39,584
Can I take a photo with you?

1782
02:02:39,709 --> 02:02:41,167
Although you think I'm ordinary,

1783
02:02:41,292 --> 02:02:42,459
and you're not my fan.

1784
02:02:42,584 --> 02:02:44,251
Can we...take a photo?

1785
02:02:45,251 --> 02:02:47,376
Yes...

1786
02:02:48,751 --> 02:02:49,751
Ok.

1787
02:02:49,876 --> 02:02:51,084
Sorry, I'm a bit...

1788
02:02:51,209 --> 02:02:52,209
nervous.

1789
02:03:00,751 --> 02:03:01,126
Good?

1790
02:03:01,251 --> 02:03:01,501
Thanks.

1791
02:03:01,626 --> 02:03:02,167
Ok.

1792
02:03:03,376 --> 02:03:04,209
By the way...

1793
02:03:05,417 --> 02:03:07,376
Can you sign for me?

1794
02:03:11,584 --> 02:03:12,792
Sure.

1795
02:03:13,834 --> 02:03:14,334
Thanks.

1796
02:03:14,459 --> 02:03:15,167
Oh!

1797
02:03:21,792 --> 02:03:24,251
Can you please write...

1798
02:03:24,376 --> 02:03:26,292
To Lin Truly

1799
02:03:26,751 --> 02:03:28,042
L.l.N.

1800
02:03:28,167 --> 02:03:29,876
Truly as in "Truly Madly Deeply".

1801
02:03:30,584 --> 02:03:32,334
Lin Truly

1802
02:03:35,251 --> 02:03:37,459
You're going to the concert tonight,

1803
02:03:37,584 --> 02:03:38,292
right?

1804
02:03:38,417 --> 02:03:39,709
How do you know?

1805
02:03:41,417 --> 02:03:41,751
Because

1806
02:03:41,876 --> 02:03:43,626
my concert is called "Truly Love You".

1807
02:03:43,751 --> 02:03:44,584
So...

1808
02:03:45,167 --> 02:03:46,334
you really have to go.

1809
02:03:48,376 --> 02:03:50,042
But I couldn't get any ticket.

1810
02:03:50,167 --> 02:03:51,459
All your concerts

1811
02:03:51,584 --> 02:03:53,376
are sold out.

1812
02:03:57,751 --> 02:03:58,792
Call this person.

1813
02:03:58,917 --> 02:04:00,334
He's our staff.

1814
02:04:00,876 --> 02:04:02,542
You have to come.

1815
02:04:03,584 --> 02:04:04,584
OK.

1816
02:04:05,751 --> 02:04:06,542
Thank you.

1817
02:04:06,667 --> 02:04:07,292
Bye bye.

1818
02:04:07,417 --> 02:04:08,501
Bye bye.

1819
02:04:08,959 --> 02:04:09,917
Don't forget.

1820
02:04:12,501 --> 02:04:13,251
Bye bye.

1821
02:04:29,459 --> 02:04:30,167
Hello?

1822
02:04:30,626 --> 02:04:31,501
Hello?

1823
02:04:31,626 --> 02:04:33,167
Hi...

1824
02:04:33,667 --> 02:04:34,667
hmmm...

1825
02:04:35,167 --> 02:04:38,792
Andy Lau gave me this number.

1826
02:04:39,834 --> 02:04:41,584
I guess he told you about it, right?

1827
02:04:43,376 --> 02:04:44,667
My name is

1828
02:04:44,792 --> 02:04:45,959
Lin Truly.

1829
02:04:49,542 --> 02:04:51,167
Lin Truly.

1830
02:04:57,584 --> 02:04:59,167
Is sesame dressing...

1831
02:05:00,626 --> 02:05:03,792
still separated from noodles?

1832
02:05:09,792 --> 02:05:11,626
The concert will start soon.

1833
02:05:11,751 --> 02:05:12,917
Are you excited?

1834
02:05:13,584 --> 02:05:14,876
I am.

1835
02:05:15,626 --> 02:05:17,126
Because one of my friends made his efforts

1836
02:05:17,251 --> 02:05:20,292
to make the concert happen.

1837
02:05:20,834 --> 02:05:23,501
He wanted to fulfill a promise he made

1838
02:05:23,917 --> 02:05:25,459
to his first love.

1839
02:05:27,251 --> 02:05:28,876
I like their story very much.

1840
02:05:30,459 --> 02:05:32,042
I want to dedicate this concert

1841
02:05:32,167 --> 02:05:34,792
to everyone who has truly loved someone.

1842
02:05:36,251 --> 02:05:37,376
Thank you.

1843
02:05:52,584 --> 02:05:53,834
Truly love you.

1844
02:05:54,917 --> 02:05:55,834
Is that you...

1845
02:05:55,959 --> 02:05:57,376
come up with this title?

1846
02:06:01,376 --> 02:06:02,542
Otherwise?

1847
02:06:10,959 --> 02:06:12,876
The concert is starting soon.

1848
02:06:14,292 --> 02:06:15,292
But...

1849
02:06:15,751 --> 02:06:17,167
I didn't get any ticket.

1850
02:06:18,459 --> 02:06:19,334
I'll ask...

1851
02:06:22,501 --> 02:06:23,751
Andy Lau

1852
02:06:24,584 --> 02:06:25,876
to sing for you.

1853
02:06:26,584 --> 02:06:27,917
Yeah right.

1854
02:06:37,167 --> 02:06:37,834
Sure.

1855
02:06:47,584 --> 02:06:48,792
It's been a long time.

1856
02:06:53,584 --> 02:06:54,876
It's been a long time.
