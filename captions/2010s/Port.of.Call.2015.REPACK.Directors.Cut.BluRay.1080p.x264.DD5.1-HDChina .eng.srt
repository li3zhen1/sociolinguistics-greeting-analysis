1
00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:52.667
(Shilong, Dongguan)

2
00:01:01.792 --> 00:01:04.208
Unforgettable days

3
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.583
Faded impressions of home

4
00:01:10.125 --> 00:01:13.833
In your diary you said I’m like

5
00:01:13.875 --> 00:01:17.583
an infatuated child, looking at the world

6
00:01:18.417 --> 00:01:21.912
But that sky above the canopy-

7
00:01:21.917 --> 00:01:25.333
wasn’t it the same back then?

8
00:01:25.917 --> 00:01:32.125
That day I didn’t understand your words

9
00:01:36.042 --> 00:01:43.292
Now I continue making a busy life for myself

10
00:01:44.708 --> 00:01:52.292
But I dream of being a simple person again

11
00:01:59.667 --> 00:02:02.250
(Wang Jiamei)

12
00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:05.417
Sis, no more. I’m on a diet

13
00:02:06.417 --> 00:02:07.583
You’re already so thin

14
00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:09.042
and you’re dieting?

15
00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.792
Mom, don’t you know?

16
00:02:10.833 --> 00:02:12.792
Jiamei wants to be a model

17
00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:16.833
You...

18
00:02:16.875 --> 00:02:19.662
Don’t speak our dialect with her

19
00:02:19.667 --> 00:02:20.958
Your Cantonese is poor

20
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.625
Don’t set a bad example for her

21
00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:27.167
How could I?
She already speaks like a Guangdong girl

22
00:03:20.417 --> 00:03:22.542
Wang Jiamei, what did she just do? What happened?

23
00:03:25.417 --> 00:03:26.292
Why didn’t you say anything?

24
00:03:26.333 --> 00:03:27.958
Don’t you know she could die?

25
00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.583
Answer me!

26
00:03:31.583 --> 00:03:34.917
You’d better stop the bleeding,
you said she could die

27
00:03:59.667 --> 00:04:01.167
Are you Wang Jiamei?

28
00:04:01.208 --> 00:04:02.250
Yes

29
00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:03.958
I am Miss Mak

30
00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.250
The students all call me Miss Mak

31
00:04:05.292 --> 00:04:06.708
the school social worker

32
00:04:07.167 --> 00:04:08.583
How would you like me to address you?

33
00:04:09.125 --> 00:04:10.458
Do you have an English name?

34
00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.917
K-A-M-A, Kama

35
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.375
I know most of the 9th grade students

36
00:04:18.417 --> 00:04:19.917
but I don’t know you

37
00:04:19.958 --> 00:04:21.625
You must be a quiet girl

38
00:04:23.583 --> 00:04:25.120
Although you get good grades

39
00:04:25.125 --> 00:04:28.958
some teachers feel you don’t like them

40
00:04:29.792 --> 00:04:32.417
Actually, I feel that some teachers don’t like me

41
00:04:34.375 --> 00:04:36.625
You wrote on Facebook

42
00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.958
I turned on the lights and saw the bed was bloody

43
00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.708
The two of us were rolling on the bed

44
00:04:45.292 --> 00:04:46.792
like pigs at a butcher’s

45
00:04:47.292 --> 00:04:49.125
That was my first time

46
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.250
That was my boyfriend in Dongguan

47
00:04:52.292 --> 00:04:53.875
We broke up

48
00:04:54.458 --> 00:04:55.917
Dongguan?

49
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.458
You’ve been in Hong Kong a year now

50
00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:01.625
and you’ve just turned

51
00:05:08.208 --> 00:05:09.917
So can you tell me why

52
00:05:09.958 --> 00:05:12.328
you saw your classmate slit her wrists

53
00:05:12.333 --> 00:05:14.083
but didn’t tell Miss Wu?

54
00:05:17.667 --> 00:05:19.167
Because I was scared

55
00:05:23.375 --> 00:05:25.500
Why did she cut herself with a knife?

56
00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.292
Many things are difficult to explain

57
00:05:57.042 --> 00:05:58.708
What is it, Officer Chong?

58
00:06:01.042 --> 00:06:02.875
Did you steal his girlfriend?

59
00:06:02.917 --> 00:06:04.375
How did you know?

60
00:06:04.417 --> 00:06:05.875
I heard the rumors

61
00:06:17.792 --> 00:06:19.375
I hitched a ride

62
00:06:19.417 --> 00:06:20.792
Yiu Tung Street, right?

63
00:06:26.042 --> 00:06:27.375
Let’s go

64
00:06:31.583 --> 00:06:33.417
You forgot your phone

65
00:06:34.875 --> 00:06:36.417
Coming

66
00:08:01.458 --> 00:08:03.708
The last person to see the victim was
Ting Tsz-chung

67
00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.833
He hasn’t been home since last night

68
00:08:06.875 --> 00:08:07.708
We’ve found the landlord

69
00:08:07.750 --> 00:08:10.292
CSI has gone over the room with an arc lamp

70
00:08:10.333 --> 00:08:11.667
There are bloodstains all over the floor

71
00:08:19.167 --> 00:08:20.167
Are there any witnesses?

72
00:08:21.333 --> 00:08:22.662
There’s an old lady

73
00:08:22.667 --> 00:08:24.500
Why don’t you rest a bit?

74
00:08:25.167 --> 00:08:26.708
If you think of anything

75
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.875
please let us know, OK?

76
00:08:41.625 --> 00:08:42.708
Mr. Ting

77
00:08:43.042 --> 00:08:44.625
What are you cooking?

78
00:08:44.958 --> 00:08:46.875
Do you need any help?

79
00:09:02.042 --> 00:09:03.333
Please take a picture for me

80
00:09:03.708 --> 00:09:04.833
Of what?

81
00:09:05.208 --> 00:09:06.250
Of me

82
00:09:06.292 --> 00:09:07.292
Of you?

83
00:09:08.125 --> 00:09:09.208
Here, I’ll do it

84
00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.083
OK

85
00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:25.125
(Looking for Mei)

86
00:09:38.875 --> 00:09:40.412
No, no, help me

87
00:09:40.417 --> 00:09:42.750
Help me, help me

88
00:09:45.167 --> 00:09:46.458
What the fuck is it?

89
00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:47.750
Pick up

90
00:09:54.125 --> 00:09:56.000
Stamp the receipt and give it to me

91
00:09:58.417 --> 00:10:02.667
Hurry up! You’re so slow

92
00:10:03.958 --> 00:10:06.542
I need to pee

93
00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.833
Pee?

94
00:10:09.667 --> 00:10:11.583
By the time you get to the customer

95
00:10:11.625 --> 00:10:14.500
they’ll complain the meat has gone bad

96
00:10:18.417 --> 00:10:20.542
Move it!

97
00:10:23.458 --> 00:10:24.792
Move it!

98
00:10:27.958 --> 00:10:28.958
Get out of here!

99
00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:30.167
Where are you from?

100
00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:31.917
Huh?

101
00:10:33.542 --> 00:10:35.125
I’m asking where you’re from, damnit

102
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.125
This morning, police found poois of blood

103
00:10:47.167 --> 00:10:50.083
in an apartment in Sham Shui Pa

104
00:10:50.125 --> 00:10:52.958
They believe someone was murdered there

105
00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:55.495
It is thought that the victim was a woman

106
00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:59.042
A male tenant is wanted by the police

107
00:10:59.083 --> 00:11:01.333
He has not been located

108
00:11:01.917 --> 00:11:03.667
Boy-boy no PlayStation

109
00:11:03.708 --> 00:11:05.662
Finish summer homework first

110
00:11:05.667 --> 00:11:06.292
Yes

111
00:11:06.333 --> 00:11:07.625
See you tonight

112
00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:17.042
Not doing anything?

113
00:11:17.083 --> 00:11:18.333
Madam Law

114
00:11:20.167 --> 00:11:21.125
Chong

115
00:11:21.792 --> 00:11:23.083
Do you really have to work so hard?

116
00:11:23.708 --> 00:11:24.500
Huh?

117
00:11:24.542 --> 00:11:26.542
You’ll exhaust yourself

118
00:11:26.583 --> 00:11:28.542
How’s the murder case going?

119
00:11:32.292 --> 00:11:34.037
The victim is Wang Jiamei

120
00:11:34.042 --> 00:11:36.833
age 16, from Hunan

121
00:11:37.792 --> 00:11:40.037
Her mother remarried 7 years ago

122
00:11:40.042 --> 00:11:42.250
but she failed to get a Hong Kong visa

123
00:11:42.292 --> 00:11:44.458
So she moved to Shilong in Dongguan

124
00:11:45.458 --> 00:11:48.370
Since her stepfather’s family was nearby

125
00:11:48.375 --> 00:11:49.958
and it’s close to Hong Kong

126
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.542
so her mother could easily come back to visit

127
00:11:54.417 --> 00:11:55.917
A year ago

128
00:11:55.958 --> 00:11:58.458
she immigrated to Hong Kong

129
00:11:59.125 --> 00:12:01.083
She left school before finishing 9th grade

130
00:12:01.875 --> 00:12:04.583
She supposedly was an assistant
at a modelling company

131
00:12:05.833 --> 00:12:07.500
but actually was a paid escort

132
00:12:08.083 --> 00:12:11.500
She was killed during sex with a client

133
00:12:11.542 --> 00:12:15.125
Her flesh was chopped up
and flushed down the toilet

134
00:12:16.042 --> 00:12:18.042
The killer ripped the skin off her face

135
00:12:19.333 --> 00:12:23.083
and carted her bones to Shek Kip Mei Market

136
00:12:24.375 --> 00:12:27.292
Great! So the case is closed?

137
00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:33.000
The killer, Ting Tsz-chung

138
00:12:33.542 --> 00:12:34.917
age 29

139
00:12:35.958 --> 00:12:38.083
claims to be a delivery driver

140
00:12:38.792 --> 00:12:40.958
but he’s a triad member

141
00:12:41.625 --> 00:12:43.500
Sells smuggled cigarettes

142
00:12:44.625 --> 00:12:47.167
The day of the murder was
the first time he had met her

143
00:12:48.292 --> 00:12:49.542
There were no bad feelings between them

144
00:12:49.583 --> 00:12:52.953
But they may have taken ketamine

145
00:12:52.958 --> 00:12:54.250
before sex

146
00:12:54.833 --> 00:12:57.458
causing him to kill her while under the influence

147
00:13:01.583 --> 00:13:03.458
Don’t smoke in my home

148
00:13:04.875 --> 00:13:06.292
You think cops can do whatever they want?

149
00:13:07.958 --> 00:13:10.083
Always dreaming of being a movie star

150
00:13:10.583 --> 00:13:12.875
or a model

151
00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:14.250
but she never looks in the mirror

152
00:13:14.292 --> 00:13:16.792
She looks just like her rotten dad

153
00:13:16.833 --> 00:13:18.500
Modelling is about more than height

154
00:13:18.833 --> 00:13:20.750
And she goes out with so many guys

155
00:13:21.292 --> 00:13:23.208
She’s always out all night

156
00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:24.708
taking birth control pills

157
00:13:24.750 --> 00:13:26.662
I know she has a boyfriend

158
00:13:26.667 --> 00:13:28.875
Fine! Don’t come back!

159
00:13:29.458 --> 00:13:31.667
Madam, the test results are back

160
00:13:31.708 --> 00:13:34.000
Your daughter may very well have passed away

161
00:13:36.583 --> 00:13:38.875
You mean she’s dead?

162
00:13:40.417 --> 00:13:42.000
What are you saying?

163
00:13:42.042 --> 00:13:42.708
Sir

164
00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:43.583
Dead, dead, dead

165
00:13:43.625 --> 00:13:45.417
Perfect timing

166
00:13:45.458 --> 00:13:46.917
Talk to her

167
00:13:47.833 --> 00:13:48.708
DPC 51334

168
00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:49.750
She’s hostile

169
00:13:49.792 --> 00:13:51.125
and thinks her daughter is still alive

170
00:13:51.167 --> 00:13:52.375
You’re crazy!

171
00:13:52.667 --> 00:13:55.625
Not thinks - hopes

172
00:13:57.792 --> 00:13:59.333
What do you want me to do?

173
00:13:59.375 --> 00:14:01.250
Make her believe her daughter is dead?

174
00:14:08.708 --> 00:14:10.208
Don’t smoke so much

175
00:14:14.625 --> 00:14:16.042
You don’t need to

176
00:14:16.708 --> 00:14:19.375
call Missing Persons every day

177
00:14:20.958 --> 00:14:22.625
They’ve given the case

178
00:14:23.708 --> 00:14:25.792
to us in Regional Crimes

179
00:14:41.917 --> 00:14:43.583
You’re luckier than many others

180
00:14:45.625 --> 00:14:48.917
In Hong Kong, one person goes missing every hour

181
00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:51.708
Many parents

182
00:14:52.792 --> 00:14:53.750
don’t know for years

183
00:14:53.792 --> 00:14:56.292
whether their children are alive or dead

184
00:15:35.083 --> 00:15:36.208
- Hi, Chuen
-May

185
00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:44.625
Chef

186
00:15:44.875 --> 00:15:47.083
It must feel good to take your shirt off, right?

187
00:15:47.125 --> 00:15:48.542
You can, too

188
00:15:49.625 --> 00:15:51.250
Let’s make a date then

189
00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:56.792
Hello, Manager

190
00:15:56.958 --> 00:15:57.583
May

191
00:15:57.625 --> 00:15:59.792
Mr. Ma keeps asking what time you start work

192
00:16:00.125 --> 00:16:02.125
Does he sign my paychecks?

193
00:16:04.833 --> 00:16:06.917
May, you’re finally here!

194
00:16:06.958 --> 00:16:08.250
Let’s dance

195
00:16:08.292 --> 00:16:10.833
No way. I need to make a living

196
00:16:10.875 --> 00:16:12.208
Are you shy?

197
00:16:12.500 --> 00:16:15.792
Well

198
00:16:15.875 --> 00:16:17.750
I’m not shameless

199
00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:38.500
Goodbye, my love

200
00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:46.542
I don’t know when we’ll meet again

201
00:16:46.583 --> 00:16:50.208
I’ve given you everything

202
00:16:50.250 --> 00:16:53.625
Please cherish that

203
00:16:53.667 --> 00:16:58.500
Don’t betray my love

204
00:17:05.083 --> 00:17:06.417
You’re still awake?

205
00:17:07.292 --> 00:17:08.167
How come?

206
00:17:08.542 --> 00:17:10.792
Sisterly bonding?

207
00:17:12.208 --> 00:17:14.083
It’s too hot

208
00:17:14.125 --> 00:17:16.708
Of course, all the lights are on

209
00:17:17.542 --> 00:17:19.000
Uncle can’t sleep with the lights on

210
00:17:25.292 --> 00:17:26.375
Jiamei

211
00:17:27.375 --> 00:17:29.083
The earrings Xia gave us

212
00:17:30.125 --> 00:17:31.917
actually belong to her daughter

213
00:17:31.958 --> 00:17:34.750
She regifted them

214
00:17:35.417 --> 00:17:37.583
She’s so cheap she wants them back?

215
00:17:38.125 --> 00:17:39.542
Why not?

216
00:17:41.708 --> 00:17:44.417
She got you a similar pair

217
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:48.667
I don’t want them

218
00:17:52.208 --> 00:17:53.750
Then throw them away yourself

219
00:17:56.667 --> 00:17:58.417
Don’t be like that, Jiamei

220
00:17:59.083 --> 00:18:00.042
Come here

221
00:18:00.083 --> 00:18:01.125
What is it?

222
00:18:01.417 --> 00:18:02.917
Stop whining!

223
00:18:04.250 --> 00:18:05.750
What have I done to you?

224
00:18:07.417 --> 00:18:09.000
They don’t belong to us

225
00:18:09.625 --> 00:18:11.458
Who says you’re poor?

226
00:18:12.958 --> 00:18:14.500
I buy you everything you want

227
00:18:15.083 --> 00:18:16.667
You said you wanted to go online

228
00:18:16.708 --> 00:18:18.542
I got you a $3000 computer

229
00:18:19.208 --> 00:18:21.250
You think I have a fortune stashed away?

230
00:18:24.292 --> 00:18:25.625
You can’t stand it anymore?

231
00:18:25.833 --> 00:18:27.120
Fine

232
00:18:27.125 --> 00:18:29.667
I’ll withdraw you from school tomorrow

233
00:18:30.792 --> 00:18:32.917
If you want to be a model

234
00:18:33.125 --> 00:18:35.750
go to work

235
00:18:35.792 --> 00:18:36.667
and make some money

236
00:18:36.708 --> 00:18:37.958
Fine

237
00:18:38.292 --> 00:18:40.708
Stop it, Mom. Go take a bath

238
00:18:52.792 --> 00:18:54.000
Which one are you playing?

239
00:18:54.125 --> 00:18:55.495
Circles

240
00:18:55.500 --> 00:18:56.833
Five Circles?

241
00:18:56.875 --> 00:18:58.542
So bold

242
00:18:59.083 --> 00:19:02.208
Do you know what you’re doing?

243
00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.500
Four Bamboos

244
00:19:08.333 --> 00:19:09.667
May

245
00:19:10.583 --> 00:19:11.958
I need to talk to you

246
00:19:13.792 --> 00:19:14.875
Here, take my place

247
00:19:15.375 --> 00:19:16.208
May

248
00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:16.917
What is it?

249
00:19:16.958 --> 00:19:19.333
I gave you a pair of earrings for your birthday

250
00:19:19.375 --> 00:19:21.083
They actually belong to my daughter

251
00:19:21.125 --> 00:19:22.917
She’s been looking for them...

252
00:19:22.958 --> 00:19:24.500
They’re expensive

253
00:19:25.083 --> 00:19:26.958
I gave them to my daughter

254
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.995
You don’t want me to take them back, do you?

255
00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.667
I’ve brought you a similar pair

256
00:19:31.708 --> 00:19:33.583
Can you switch them with Jiamei’s?

257
00:19:34.083 --> 00:19:35.417
Fakes?

258
00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.537
They’re the same to the kids

259
00:19:38.542 --> 00:19:40.542
Really? Then why do you want to trade?

260
00:19:42.208 --> 00:19:43.708
Are they really expensive?

261
00:19:44.833 --> 00:19:46.542
Over $4000,

262
00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:49.708
Sure... I’ll give them back tomorrow

263
00:20:10.083 --> 00:20:11.250
Fatty

264
00:20:11.667 --> 00:20:12.792
What are you doing here?

265
00:20:12.833 --> 00:20:14.750
I came to see the Regional Crime Unit

266
00:20:15.917 --> 00:20:17.250
Sign in here

267
00:20:18.167 --> 00:20:19.250
OK

268
00:20:24.083 --> 00:20:25.792
Write down why you’re here

269
00:20:25.833 --> 00:20:27.167
I came to turn myself in

270
00:20:27.792 --> 00:20:30.000
Young man, admit your mistakes and change

271
00:20:31.375 --> 00:20:32.745
What did you do?

272
00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:34.250
Assault or theft?

273
00:20:35.125 --> 00:20:36.500
I killed someone

274
00:21:10.125 --> 00:21:12.042
Do you understand the consequences

275
00:21:13.750 --> 00:21:15.125
of what you’ve just said?

276
00:21:17.625 --> 00:21:19.208
You may go to jail for life

277
00:21:21.958 --> 00:21:24.125
I hope you’re sure of what you are saying

278
00:21:25.208 --> 00:21:27.042
I only speak the truth

279
00:21:46.417 --> 00:21:47.625
That’s not him

280
00:21:47.750 --> 00:21:49.167
You don’t need to say who it’s not

281
00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:51.667
Is that him?

282
00:21:52.667 --> 00:21:54.208
Definitely not

283
00:22:05.958 --> 00:22:08.167
That’s him, the one with the owl tattoo

284
00:22:09.458 --> 00:22:10.833
Prodigy Hoi

285
00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:19.708
After him!

286
00:22:21.500 --> 00:22:23.542
What the fuck! This is police business

287
00:22:24.333 --> 00:22:25.703
Flora, watch the car

288
00:22:25.708 --> 00:22:26.958
It’s illegal to park here

289
00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:28.750
But we’re on police business

290
00:22:28.792 --> 00:22:30.125
We’ll get a ticket

291
00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.208
Stop

292
00:22:44.250 --> 00:22:45.542
Scum bag

293
00:22:47.208 --> 00:22:48.208
Out of the way

294
00:22:48.708 --> 00:22:49.833
He’s gone

295
00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.333
Thanks, Miss

296
00:23:17.458 --> 00:23:18.750
Open up

297
00:23:20.917 --> 00:23:22.542
Police! Open up

298
00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:33.750
Calm down

299
00:23:34.208 --> 00:23:35.792
We’re just looking for someone

300
00:23:35.833 --> 00:23:37.125
Nothing to do with you

301
00:23:37.583 --> 00:23:39.125
Careful it doesn’t backfire, sir

302
00:23:39.167 --> 00:23:40.708
Shut up

303
00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:56.792
Come out

304
00:24:02.167 --> 00:24:03.620
Let’s go! No looking around

305
00:24:03.625 --> 00:24:04.833
Which gang are you in?

306
00:24:05.125 --> 00:24:08.000
I’ll send someone to say hello to your boss

307
00:24:11.458 --> 00:24:12.750
We got our guy

308
00:24:12.875 --> 00:24:13.917
but trespassed onto

309
00:24:13.958 --> 00:24:15.500
some gang’s turf

310
00:24:15.542 --> 00:24:17.292
They may be Sum’s men

311
00:24:18.292 --> 00:24:19.625
We’re coming down now

312
00:24:20.250 --> 00:24:21.750
The first game pays more than double

313
00:24:21.792 --> 00:24:23.750
it’s a good deal

314
00:24:23.792 --> 00:24:24.958
Believe me

315
00:24:25.625 --> 00:24:27.162
Thank you, Boss

316
00:24:27.167 --> 00:24:28.750
Sure, sure

317
00:24:28.792 --> 00:24:31.292
That’s it, then. Bye bye

318
00:24:32.542 --> 00:24:33.833
Wolfsburg is definitely

319
00:24:33.875 --> 00:24:35.625
lose-burg

320
00:24:36.833 --> 00:24:39.250
Hoi, you’re doing well

321
00:24:39.375 --> 00:24:40.833
Officer

322
00:24:40.875 --> 00:24:43.333
I’ve been very discreet

323
00:24:44.417 --> 00:24:46.417
but you can still tell
I’m doing under-the-table betting?

324
00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.125
Amazing

325
00:24:50.417 --> 00:24:51.708
But many of your colleagues

326
00:24:51.750 --> 00:24:54.245
also bet on soccer

327
00:24:54.250 --> 00:24:55.912
It’s not a serious crime like murder

328
00:24:55.917 --> 00:24:57.625
But your buddy did commit murder

329
00:24:58.208 --> 00:24:59.333
Which buddy?

330
00:24:59.375 --> 00:25:01.042
No need to play dumb

331
00:25:01.083 --> 00:25:03.333
Fat Ting admitted to it

332
00:25:03.750 --> 00:25:05.750
We just want to ask you some questions

333
00:25:10.125 --> 00:25:11.125
I wont answer anything

334
00:25:11.167 --> 00:25:13.125
without my lawyer here

335
00:25:17.375 --> 00:25:20.833
Betraying a buddy is taboo in gangs

336
00:25:21.292 --> 00:25:24.417
Please! It’s murder!

337
00:25:24.458 --> 00:25:27.458
No one is stupid enough to turn himself in

338
00:25:29.958 --> 00:25:32.287
Officer, you look familiar

339
00:25:32.292 --> 00:25:34.417
You smoke Marlboro Reds, right?

340
00:25:34.458 --> 00:25:35.453
Have you bought from me before?

341
00:25:35.458 --> 00:25:36.833
You motherfucker

342
00:25:38.458 --> 00:25:39.287
Yes, yes

343
00:25:39.292 --> 00:25:41.167
He left violin at the teacher

344
00:25:41.208 --> 00:25:43.458
Yes, you go, bring it back

345
00:25:43.625 --> 00:25:44.787
Bring it

346
00:25:44.792 --> 00:25:45.453
Violin

347
00:25:45.458 --> 00:25:46.625
Not aeroplane

348
00:25:51.833 --> 00:25:53.162
What are you doing?

349
00:25:53.167 --> 00:25:54.333
Beating a suspect?

350
00:25:54.375 --> 00:25:56.250
Madam, he’s a witness

351
00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:57.995
Smokey

352
00:25:58.000 --> 00:25:59.667
I told you to watch your leader

353
00:25:59.708 --> 00:26:01.167
Where’s Smokey?

354
00:26:12.167 --> 00:26:14.250
Sorry, I didn’t recognize you when you walked by

355
00:26:15.333 --> 00:26:16.458
What happened, Chong?

356
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:17.750
One-on-one?

357
00:26:17.792 --> 00:26:19.458
Why is he the only one hurt?

358
00:26:20.333 --> 00:26:22.167
Now you know who’s better at it

359
00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:24.875
Did you call an ambulance?

360
00:26:25.708 --> 00:26:28.833
No need, just scratches

361
00:26:28.958 --> 00:26:30.500
Not for you

362
00:26:30.542 --> 00:26:32.417
for the guy inside

363
00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:34.250
Yes, we did

364
00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:39.792
We got it

365
00:26:39.833 --> 00:26:41.833
The fake credit card factory is the Wo’s

366
00:26:41.875 --> 00:26:43.958
I’ll say you went on an informant’s clue

367
00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000
Otherwise we’ll never hear the end of it

368
00:26:48.208 --> 00:26:49.333
Thanks

369
00:26:49.417 --> 00:26:50.750
You’re welcome

370
00:26:50.792 --> 00:26:52.703
Just stop once you get the evidence

371
00:26:52.708 --> 00:26:54.250
Your team may follow you

372
00:26:54.292 --> 00:26:55.958
but think of yourself

373
00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:57.203
If you keep this up

374
00:26:57.208 --> 00:26:59.208
you may not get another promotion

375
00:27:00.542 --> 00:27:03.125
Finish your report and have it to me by 5pm

376
00:27:03.667 --> 00:27:04.625
Yes, Madam

377
00:27:04.667 --> 00:27:07.625
Remember the workplace smoking ban is in effect

378
00:27:12.833 --> 00:27:14.000
How much longer for the ambulance?

379
00:27:36.875 --> 00:27:39.333
Has Ting ever mentioned his mother?

380
00:27:40.875 --> 00:27:43.000
She died when he was a kid

381
00:27:44.750 --> 00:27:48.333
I want to have sex

382
00:27:48.833 --> 00:27:50.542
Crazy, go jerk off

383
00:27:51.250 --> 00:27:52.542
Go jerk off

384
00:27:52.583 --> 00:27:55.125
I’ve done it so much I have prostate infections

385
00:27:55.833 --> 00:27:57.625
Ass hole

386
00:27:57.667 --> 00:27:59.583
why don’t take some AV back

387
00:27:59.708 --> 00:28:01.458
It’s community welfare

388
00:28:07.458 --> 00:28:09.625
Why are you looking at my mom’s picture?

389
00:28:12.208 --> 00:28:14.000
I know what you’re thinking

390
00:28:14.083 --> 00:28:16.250
stay away from my mom’s picture

391
00:28:16.625 --> 00:28:18.125
Don’t you dare

392
00:28:23.250 --> 00:28:24.708
I’ll take it, thank you

393
00:28:27.583 --> 00:28:28.287
Ass hole

394
00:28:28.292 --> 00:28:29.208
Be careful of your mom

395
00:28:29.250 --> 00:28:32.292
You asshole

396
00:28:33.292 --> 00:28:34.250
You want to jerk off?

397
00:28:34.292 --> 00:28:35.458
I’ll help you jerk off

398
00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.792
Come on

399
00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.292
You asshole

400
00:28:43.458 --> 00:28:44.667
Let me borrow this

401
00:28:44.708 --> 00:28:45.833
Fuck off

402
00:28:51.375 --> 00:28:52.750
Stay away

403
00:28:52.958 --> 00:28:54.125
His father?

404
00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:56.667
No, they don’t talk much

405
00:28:57.542 --> 00:28:58.625
His girlfriend?

406
00:29:00.833 --> 00:29:02.375
Girlfriend?

407
00:29:13.667 --> 00:29:14.875
That’s Mo-yung

408
00:29:15.208 --> 00:29:16.958
She’s not his girlfriend

409
00:29:24.875 --> 00:29:27.542
Right, Lok Wo Sha Lane in Ma On Shan

410
00:29:28.042 --> 00:29:29.042
Thanks

411
00:29:29.083 --> 00:29:30.583
OK, twenty minutes

412
00:29:44.208 --> 00:29:46.083
Miss, do you need help?

413
00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.542
No, Big Boy’s van broke down

414
00:29:50.917 --> 00:29:53.000
That’s a lot of stuff

415
00:29:53.583 --> 00:29:55.037
Yeah, I’m moving

416
00:29:55.042 --> 00:29:57.125
and switching boyfriends at the same time

417
00:29:57.167 --> 00:29:58.500
Really?

418
00:29:58.542 --> 00:30:00.250
Give me your number

419
00:30:00.292 --> 00:30:02.792
I can help the next time you move

420
00:30:03.583 --> 00:30:05.583
That’s OK, thanks

421
00:30:05.625 --> 00:30:07.875
It’s all right, I’m a policeman

422
00:30:08.667 --> 00:30:10.708
I’m a good citizen, too

423
00:30:11.333 --> 00:30:13.583
Take care

424
00:30:21.958 --> 00:30:24.042
I hate people who fall all over themselves

425
00:30:24.083 --> 00:30:25.917
to flirt with me

426
00:30:28.208 --> 00:30:29.208
It’s true

427
00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:31.000
I hate flatterers

428
00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:41.958
So can I have your phone number?

429
00:30:44.208 --> 00:30:46.833
Didn’t you get it when I called
for your van just now?

430
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:12.333
Do you think Ting really loved Mo-yung?

431
00:31:14.375 --> 00:31:15.792
That Fat Ting

432
00:31:15.833 --> 00:31:17.542
drives an old van

433
00:31:17.583 --> 00:31:19.042
His temper is short

434
00:31:19.083 --> 00:31:21.292
so he often loses jobs

435
00:31:21.458 --> 00:31:22.667
Then he has to pinch pennies

436
00:31:22.708 --> 00:31:24.625
He often gives her gifts

437
00:31:24.667 --> 00:31:26.250
I told him

438
00:31:26.292 --> 00:31:27.828
Chung

439
00:31:27.833 --> 00:31:29.667
There’s no such thing as a ‘freeze crew’

440
00:31:30.917 --> 00:31:32.500
What’s a ‘freeze crew’?

441
00:31:33.833 --> 00:31:35.208
I mean

442
00:31:35.250 --> 00:31:38.125
there’s no such thing as a ‘free screw’!

443
00:31:38.167 --> 00:31:39.333
You old fogey!

444
00:31:40.458 --> 00:31:41.667
Oh, ‘free screw’

445
00:31:57.708 --> 00:31:59.667
I’m going to LA soon

446
00:32:01.167 --> 00:32:05.083
LA? In the US?

447
00:32:07.625 --> 00:32:08.875
Yes

448
00:32:17.208 --> 00:32:21.917
But he has a wife and kids

449
00:32:22.375 --> 00:32:24.042
I’ll have a husband, too

450
00:32:24.292 --> 00:32:25.375
someday

451
00:32:27.583 --> 00:32:28.792
Me?

452
00:32:30.708 --> 00:32:32.333
You’re high?

453
00:32:44.708 --> 00:32:47.417
Oh, Ah B is here

454
00:32:47.458 --> 00:32:51.208
Ah B is afraid of everyone except Mr. Ting

455
00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:52.625
So arrogant

456
00:32:52.667 --> 00:32:54.208
No, its called being clever

457
00:32:54.250 --> 00:32:56.542
Cats are good judges of character

458
00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:59.078
Auntie, I’ll bring him back to you soon

459
00:32:59.083 --> 00:33:00.458
No hurry

460
00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:01.958
Sorry to disturb you

461
00:33:13.917 --> 00:33:15.250
I’m in here

462
00:33:22.208 --> 00:33:23.375
What are you doing?

463
00:33:25.833 --> 00:33:27.792
Hurry, open the door

464
00:33:30.500 --> 00:33:31.453
What were you doing?

465
00:33:31.458 --> 00:33:32.458
Peeping?

466
00:33:33.708 --> 00:33:34.583
What is it?

467
00:33:35.125 --> 00:33:36.458
What is it?

468
00:33:37.542 --> 00:33:38.375
What are you doing?

469
00:33:38.417 --> 00:33:40.000
I thought Junkie was inside

470
00:33:40.875 --> 00:33:42.125
Forget about it

471
00:33:43.792 --> 00:33:44.708
You know each other?

472
00:33:45.292 --> 00:33:46.250
Nice

473
00:33:46.292 --> 00:33:48.792
Shut up

474
00:33:48.833 --> 00:33:50.083
OK

475
00:33:53.292 --> 00:33:54.750
Go home

476
00:33:55.750 --> 00:33:57.250
I said, go home

477
00:33:57.375 --> 00:33:58.250
What’s going on?

478
00:33:58.292 --> 00:33:59.458
Go home

479
00:34:00.083 --> 00:34:01.292
Everything’s OK

480
00:34:01.333 --> 00:34:02.875
Drug addicts causing trouble?

481
00:34:03.125 --> 00:34:04.958
Nothing

482
00:34:05.458 --> 00:34:07.125
OK, OK

483
00:34:07.458 --> 00:34:10.000
That’s right,make up with your girlfriend

484
00:34:10.042 --> 00:34:11.250
Goodnight, Auntie

485
00:34:11.292 --> 00:34:12.625
Goodnight

486
00:34:19.708 --> 00:34:21.333
Forget about it

487
00:34:39.750 --> 00:34:41.458
You really want it that bad?

488
00:34:44.042 --> 00:34:45.458
I’ll help you with my hands

489
00:35:16.542 --> 00:35:18.542
Sergeant, the ambulance is here

490
00:35:20.083 --> 00:35:21.500
Let me ask one final question

491
00:35:22.208 --> 00:35:26.083
Madam, ask your chief to let me go

492
00:35:30.042 --> 00:35:31.958
Ting phoned you after the murder

493
00:35:32.458 --> 00:35:33.583
What did he say?

494
00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:43.667
I didn’t know such a thin person
could have so much fat

495
00:35:44.333 --> 00:35:46.250
What the hell are you talking about?

496
00:36:16.167 --> 00:36:19.000
They say the divers can only find whole corpses

497
00:36:20.125 --> 00:36:22.208
I don’t know if they can find just a head

498
00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.250
May I talk to you about some things

499
00:36:36.292 --> 00:36:38.583
unrelated to your case?

500
00:36:39.833 --> 00:36:41.120
Sure

501
00:36:41.125 --> 00:36:42.875
That’s what I like listening to the most

502
00:36:46.208 --> 00:36:49.042
My sister didn’t quit school

503
00:36:49.083 --> 00:36:51.792
to help with family expenses

504
00:36:52.792 --> 00:36:55.667
She said she wanted to make more money

505
00:36:57.333 --> 00:36:59.000
I feel Jiamei was a little...

506
00:36:59.833 --> 00:37:01.167
Unhappy?

507
00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:05.208
I think so, too, but she would never admit it

508
00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:08.042
Jiamei changed

509
00:37:08.083 --> 00:37:09.917
after coming to Hong Kong

510
00:37:09.958 --> 00:37:11.917
she kept everything to herself

511
00:37:11.958 --> 00:37:14.125
unlike when she was little

512
00:37:14.625 --> 00:37:17.458
Mom has changed a lot in Hong Kong, too

513
00:37:17.500 --> 00:37:19.000
and she’s aged a lot

514
00:37:29.292 --> 00:37:30.958
If you want to speak to Uncle

515
00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.333
make an appointment to meet him outside

516
00:37:33.375 --> 00:37:36.167
He won’t say anything in front of Mom

517
00:37:39.125 --> 00:37:41.667
I’ve never seen a more cooperative witness

518
00:37:43.375 --> 00:37:46.958
I feel better after speaking to you

519
00:37:53.125 --> 00:37:54.792
Can you take a picture for me?

520
00:37:54.833 --> 00:37:55.458
You and me?

521
00:37:55.500 --> 00:37:57.083
No, take one of me

522
00:37:57.250 --> 00:37:58.583
Look through the lens, here

523
00:37:59.000 --> 00:38:00.375
Then press the red button

524
00:38:03.958 --> 00:38:04.583
Are these yours?

525
00:38:04.625 --> 00:38:05.792
No, they’re my sister’s

526
00:38:05.958 --> 00:38:09.375
She always felt she wasn’t tall enough

527
00:38:09.833 --> 00:38:10.875
She wanted to be a model

528
00:38:10.917 --> 00:38:13.000
so she bought these

529
00:38:28.875 --> 00:38:31.083
Your music is too internet-y

530
00:38:31.292 --> 00:38:35.083
Mom said not to speak our dialect here

531
00:38:35.208 --> 00:38:36.833
But you speak it with her

532
00:38:37.167 --> 00:38:38.417
Pig skull

533
00:38:38.458 --> 00:38:39.833
You’re the Pig skull

534
00:38:52.875 --> 00:38:54.542
Good luck tomorrow

535
00:39:02.458 --> 00:39:03.708
Name?

536
00:39:05.708 --> 00:39:06.917
Thanks

537
00:39:09.667 --> 00:39:12.667
OK, 1, 2, 3

538
00:39:24.208 --> 00:39:27.917
I heard the tabloid paid you for an interview

539
00:39:28.292 --> 00:39:30.375
I didn’t ask you for money, though

540
00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:33.708
True, everyone needs to eat

541
00:39:35.208 --> 00:39:37.953
What did you want to ask?

542
00:39:37.958 --> 00:39:40.500
Do you have enough evidence to charge Ting?

543
00:39:40.583 --> 00:39:41.667
Rice with black beans and fish

544
00:39:41.708 --> 00:39:43.208
Great, thanks

545
00:39:45.875 --> 00:39:47.000
Mr. Siu

546
00:39:48.042 --> 00:39:50.833
Did Jiamei ever say whether she was afraid to die?

547
00:39:51.500 --> 00:39:53.417
Ting said he only killed Jiamei

548
00:39:53.458 --> 00:39:55.583
because she told him she wanted to die

549
00:39:57.208 --> 00:40:01.208
Officer, that question

550
00:40:01.500 --> 00:40:03.292
is a fucking difficult one

551
00:40:03.833 --> 00:40:05.792
Nevermind, chief

552
00:40:05.833 --> 00:40:07.958
We’ll wait to read about it in the tabloid

553
00:40:14.250 --> 00:40:16.292
You should ask Jiamei’s mom

554
00:40:16.333 --> 00:40:18.708
or her real dad

555
00:40:20.458 --> 00:40:21.542
Her real dad?

556
00:40:21.792 --> 00:40:25.203
Yes, he does off-site betting

557
00:40:25.208 --> 00:40:26.500
in Hunan

558
00:40:26.542 --> 00:40:28.292
Every time Manchester United lost

559
00:40:28.333 --> 00:40:32.042
Jiamei would text to congratulate him

560
00:40:38.708 --> 00:40:42.042
Uncle, who do you think will win this match?

561
00:40:42.542 --> 00:40:44.083
That’s last night’s game

562
00:40:44.125 --> 00:40:45.500
Who won?

563
00:40:45.792 --> 00:40:47.667
Manchester United lost

564
00:40:48.917 --> 00:40:50.870
Aren’t you trying to be a model?

565
00:40:50.875 --> 00:40:52.417
You’re just sitting around

566
00:40:52.875 --> 00:40:54.042
Are you a star yet?

567
00:40:54.208 --> 00:40:56.125
Mom, stay still when you speak

568
00:41:00.667 --> 00:41:01.875
Your cell phone rang

569
00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:09.583
Which whore sent you a text message?

570
00:41:12.458 --> 00:41:14.625
Not a whore, my daughter

571
00:41:14.667 --> 00:41:16.042
Long-distance, too

572
00:41:16.667 --> 00:41:19.417
(Jiamei: Congrats, Dad , Man U lost)

573
00:41:23.250 --> 00:41:26.250
(Dad: Good girl. Work hard, stay healthy)

574
00:41:39.417 --> 00:41:40.625
Miss, do you have a moment?

575
00:41:40.667 --> 00:41:41.875
Would you like to be a part-time model?

576
00:41:41.917 --> 00:41:43.792
Sorry, I don’t speak Chinese

577
00:41:43.833 --> 00:41:45.792
Miss, do you have a few moments to talk?

578
00:41:45.833 --> 00:41:48.958
Miss, would you like to be a part-time model?

579
00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.417
Miss, can we talk for a few moments ?

580
00:41:50.458 --> 00:41:51.458
Would you be interested

581
00:42:03.625 --> 00:42:05.333
Are you upset...

582
00:42:08.708 --> 00:42:10.792
that the company is not signing you as a model?

583
00:42:14.583 --> 00:42:16.042
You said yourself

584
00:42:17.542 --> 00:42:19.792
As long as you’re paid, you’d do anything

585
00:42:21.708 --> 00:42:23.792
We hired you, but you’re lazy

586
00:42:29.833 --> 00:42:32.162
Miss, are you interested in being a model?

587
00:42:32.167 --> 00:42:33.375
Please listen to me for a moment

588
00:42:33.417 --> 00:42:34.167
Do you have a moment?

589
00:42:34.208 --> 00:42:35.500
No thanks

590
00:42:42.625 --> 00:42:44.995
Miss, a few words, please?

591
00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.625
Miss, you are so beautiful

592
00:42:47.958 --> 00:42:50.500
If you say you want to be a singer

593
00:42:50.542 --> 00:42:52.625
others may laugh at you

594
00:42:52.667 --> 00:42:54.500
But being a part-time model is different

595
00:42:54.542 --> 00:42:56.000
it’s easy and pretty

596
00:42:56.042 --> 00:42:58.000
You just let people take photos

597
00:42:58.042 --> 00:43:00.125
Why aren’t you doing it?

598
00:43:00.167 --> 00:43:02.208
I’m a talent scout now

599
00:43:02.875 --> 00:43:05.875
Without scouts, there would be no talent

600
00:43:05.917 --> 00:43:07.167
Right?

601
00:43:07.375 --> 00:43:09.167
Here’s our business card

602
00:43:19.167 --> 00:43:23.000
You know how to talk

603
00:43:24.125 --> 00:43:26.500
That’s how your guy persuaded me

604
00:43:26.542 --> 00:43:28.292
to audition for you

605
00:43:28.333 --> 00:43:30.417
I remember what he said

606
00:43:30.458 --> 00:43:31.833
and just repeated it

607
00:43:40.375 --> 00:43:41.458
Today’s pay

608
00:43:41.917 --> 00:43:43.375
That’s all?

609
00:43:43.917 --> 00:43:47.875
You only worked two hours

610
00:43:47.917 --> 00:43:49.250
I can work more

611
00:43:49.375 --> 00:43:53.250
We target people at lunch time and after work

612
00:43:58.458 --> 00:44:01.833
This meal from McDonald’s is on me...
a first-day gift

613
00:44:09.167 --> 00:44:10.875
(More than just a job)

614
00:44:10.917 --> 00:44:12.625
(Welcome to join the McDonald’s Family)

615
00:44:17.667 --> 00:44:18.917
I’m full

616
00:44:31.917 --> 00:44:34.125
- Finally, you’re here.
- Yes!

617
00:44:34.292 --> 00:44:35.120
Did you put on weight?

618
00:44:35.125 --> 00:44:37.292
None of your business

619
00:44:38.667 --> 00:44:40.458
I thought you were desperate for money

620
00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:41.953
Why did you quit ‘MacDonald’s so quickly?

621
00:44:41.958 --> 00:44:43.333
It’s ‘McDonald’s’

622
00:44:43.375 --> 00:44:44.750
not ‘MacDonald’s’

623
00:44:44.792 --> 00:44:45.833
Don’t laugh at her

624
00:44:45.875 --> 00:44:47.542
She still can’t get it right after two months

625
00:44:47.583 --> 00:44:49.708
You can’t hide the fact you’re from the mainland

626
00:44:49.750 --> 00:44:51.458
You have a harsh tongue

627
00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:54.250
You make a lot of money now?

628
00:44:54.292 --> 00:44:56.542
Finally, we’re onto the real topic

629
00:44:56.583 --> 00:44:57.792
I’m just asking

630
00:44:57.833 --> 00:44:59.750
I don’t want to listen to this

631
00:45:02.875 --> 00:45:04.120
Think about how she feels

632
00:45:04.125 --> 00:45:06.083
Don’t talk about this in front of her sister

633
00:45:06.292 --> 00:45:08.667
She has her own hardships

634
00:45:08.708 --> 00:45:13.125
She wanted to see the band Fahrenheit in Taiwan

635
00:45:13.625 --> 00:45:15.625
So her cousin introduced her to this business

636
00:45:15.667 --> 00:45:17.875
Your cousin got you into the business?

637
00:45:17.917 --> 00:45:21.000
She wasn’t even 16 then

638
00:45:21.042 --> 00:45:22.583
She couldn’t look for a job

639
00:45:22.625 --> 00:45:25.208
So she found one that didn’t require an interview

640
00:45:25.250 --> 00:45:27.667
Was a Fahrenheit ticket very expensive?

641
00:45:27.708 --> 00:45:31.375
But they did six concerts

642
00:45:31.417 --> 00:45:34.417
Jiamei, do you really want to be an escort?

643
00:45:35.583 --> 00:45:37.500
She really needs the money

644
00:45:37.958 --> 00:45:39.000
She wants to move out

645
00:45:39.042 --> 00:45:40.750
so she’s doing two jobs

646
00:45:40.792 --> 00:45:42.208
Really?

647
00:45:42.250 --> 00:45:43.917
I asked youreally?

648
00:45:50.958 --> 00:45:52.458
Is it too dark?

649
00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.000
Open the curtains

650
00:45:55.333 --> 00:45:56.458
All right

651
00:46:05.833 --> 00:46:07.125
Sorry

652
00:46:07.375 --> 00:46:08.917
There’s no need to stack them

653
00:46:08.958 --> 00:46:11.000
I have many more in my room

654
00:46:11.292 --> 00:46:14.125
Jiali and I will recycle them later

655
00:46:14.333 --> 00:46:16.042
make some money

656
00:46:16.958 --> 00:46:18.000
We’ll help

657
00:46:18.042 --> 00:46:19.208
What’s wrong?

658
00:46:19.250 --> 00:46:21.208
Are you worried we’re not strong enough?

659
00:46:23.042 --> 00:46:25.458
Concentrate on finding evidence

660
00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:28.292
to put the scumbag away for life!

661
00:46:29.583 --> 00:46:31.833
The fat kid said

662
00:46:32.042 --> 00:46:34.583
he and my daughter took drugs

663
00:46:34.958 --> 00:46:37.875
Did he kill her because he got too high?

664
00:46:38.875 --> 00:46:40.417
Unlikely

665
00:46:41.583 --> 00:46:43.750
He is clear about every step of that murder

666
00:46:45.042 --> 00:46:46.875
Except we cannot find the body

667
00:46:49.542 --> 00:46:51.292
Do you think he’s lying?

668
00:46:51.417 --> 00:46:52.625
I don’t know

669
00:46:54.667 --> 00:46:57.667
Was my daughter one of those?

670
00:47:01.375 --> 00:47:03.208
Was Jiamei a prostitute?

671
00:47:14.750 --> 00:47:16.500
Are you smoking in there?

672
00:47:18.583 --> 00:47:19.333
Pardon me

673
00:47:19.375 --> 00:47:20.042
Sorry

674
00:47:20.083 --> 00:47:21.667
I forgot you can’t smoke here

675
00:47:22.792 --> 00:47:23.917
Give me one

676
00:47:26.125 --> 00:47:27.500
Here

677
00:47:29.458 --> 00:47:30.792
Here

678
00:47:33.375 --> 00:47:34.708
It’s a bit strong

679
00:48:02.292 --> 00:48:04.625
(Missing Person)

680
00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.292
Hello

681
00:49:44.208 --> 00:49:47.208
Can you be my girlfriend?

682
00:49:47.708 --> 00:49:49.083
Of course

683
00:50:00.625 --> 00:50:03.417
(A Lonely Person)

684
00:50:57.250 --> 00:51:00.083
I can’t really be your girlfriend

685
00:51:00.125 --> 00:51:01.500
Give it up

686
00:51:02.458 --> 00:51:04.208
I lied just now

687
00:51:05.583 --> 00:51:06.625
When I left the hotel

688
00:51:06.667 --> 00:51:07.708
I’d already forgotten you

689
00:51:07.750 --> 00:51:09.167
Bye bye

690
00:51:12.625 --> 00:51:13.995
Shall I wrap them up?

691
00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.333
No, I’ll wear them out

692
00:51:15.417 --> 00:51:17.708
$4,388, please

693
00:51:58.375 --> 00:51:59.625
(Stop Domestic Violence)

694
00:52:02.208 --> 00:52:04.333
No wonder you look so familiar

695
00:52:05.042 --> 00:52:06.292
That’s not me

696
00:52:06.875 --> 00:52:08.042
How can you say it’s not you?

697
00:52:08.083 --> 00:52:09.792
I’ll cut off my dick if it’s not you

698
00:52:10.583 --> 00:52:14.042
Look, here, too

699
00:52:14.083 --> 00:52:15.833
You’re so popular

700
00:52:22.417 --> 00:52:24.125
You’re very photogenic

701
00:52:29.417 --> 00:52:33.078
You’d be perfect for a job I have

702
00:52:33.083 --> 00:52:34.625
It’s a public service advertisement

703
00:52:51.292 --> 00:52:52.583
Have you had dinner yet?

704
00:52:54.083 --> 00:52:55.625
You come and go as you please

705
00:52:56.375 --> 00:53:00.167
When do you plan on

706
00:53:00.208 --> 00:53:01.287
returning the toy?

707
00:53:01.292 --> 00:53:03.292
Don’t get me in trouble

708
00:53:03.333 --> 00:53:04.542
It’s useful, sir

709
00:53:04.583 --> 00:53:06.625
Find something to substitute for it

710
00:53:11.417 --> 00:53:13.625
I see you playing with it sometimes

711
00:53:13.667 --> 00:53:15.333
Don’t make fun of me

712
00:53:16.083 --> 00:53:17.958
This is a big deal

713
00:53:20.792 --> 00:53:21.917
A dismembered body case

714
00:53:21.958 --> 00:53:23.917
That girl was amazing

715
00:53:23.958 --> 00:53:26.208
Only 16...taking on customers at such a young age

716
00:53:26.917 --> 00:53:29.708
If a person is capable of such a sacrifice

717
00:53:29.792 --> 00:53:32.125
selling their body so they can live another life

718
00:53:32.458 --> 00:53:34.250
why would they suddenly want to die?

719
00:53:38.625 --> 00:53:39.792
What is it?

720
00:53:39.833 --> 00:53:41.625
Afraid I’d catch cold?

721
00:53:41.917 --> 00:53:43.167


722
00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:45.708
your butt is too bright

723
00:53:46.833 --> 00:53:48.583
Didn’t I get to the next level? Why did it die?

724
00:53:49.167 --> 00:53:50.458
It’s my turn now

725
00:53:55.958 --> 00:53:57.917
Can you escape my grip?

726
00:53:58.042 --> 00:53:59.167
Open up

727
00:54:04.875 --> 00:54:06.667
You’ll ruin the machine

728
00:54:52.333 --> 00:54:54.870
Can you give me your NDS?

729
00:54:54.875 --> 00:54:57.083
My sister and I love playing it

730
00:54:57.875 --> 00:55:00.375
Not this one

731
00:55:00.417 --> 00:55:01.917
Someone gave it to me

732
00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:03.208
Nevermind then

733
00:55:06.042 --> 00:55:07.292
Or

734
00:55:07.333 --> 00:55:10.042
I can buy you a new one

735
00:55:10.083 --> 00:55:12.875
to make up for all the free dates

736
00:55:12.917 --> 00:55:14.625
you’ve given me

737
00:55:15.208 --> 00:55:16.833
No, forget about it

738
00:55:24.417 --> 00:55:26.292
You have hairy armpits?

739
00:55:26.917 --> 00:55:28.250
You don’t like that?

740
00:55:28.792 --> 00:55:29.875
I like it

741
00:55:29.917 --> 00:55:31.750
I have them too, see?

742
00:55:33.958 --> 00:55:35.625
Let me play with it

743
00:55:46.708 --> 00:55:48.625
Sergeant

744
00:55:48.667 --> 00:55:50.287
How can there be so many facts?

745
00:55:50.292 --> 00:55:52.292
Facts are just for prosecuting

746
00:55:52.625 --> 00:55:54.250
You’ve seen so many bad guys by now

747
00:55:54.292 --> 00:55:55.708
how can you not tell them apart?

748
00:55:58.125 --> 00:55:59.958
The more bad guys you see

749
00:56:00.333 --> 00:56:02.292
the more you don’t want them to exist

750
00:56:03.417 --> 00:56:04.958
Do you remember in ‘98

751
00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:06.625
we worked together on a case

752
00:56:07.125 --> 00:56:08.042
The victim

753
00:56:08.083 --> 00:56:10.000
was tortured for almost a month before she died

754
00:56:10.042 --> 00:56:11.583
The medical examiner said

755
00:56:11.625 --> 00:56:12.792
her whole face must have been swollen

756
00:56:12.833 --> 00:56:14.083
Her mouth was bleeding

757
00:56:14.125 --> 00:56:15.333
Her body was covered in blisters

758
00:56:15.375 --> 00:56:16.792
All her wounds oozed pus

759
00:56:17.167 --> 00:56:18.542
Shut up

760
00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.458
I don’t want to be reminded

761
00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:21.917
I’ll have nightmares

762
00:56:22.625 --> 00:56:24.792
It’s because I can’t stand the gore that

763
00:56:24.833 --> 00:56:26.667
I transferred to the Operations Support Sub-unit

764
00:56:28.917 --> 00:56:30.500
I’ll never forget that day

765
00:56:30.750 --> 00:56:32.417


766
00:56:48.333 --> 00:56:50.167
Sir, there’s a child here

767
00:56:56.625 --> 00:56:57.958
Knife

768
00:57:17.417 --> 00:57:18.458
Got it

769
00:57:20.792 --> 00:57:22.208
She’s the victim’s daughter

770
00:57:32.375 --> 00:57:34.375
Be brave

771
00:57:34.917 --> 00:57:36.417
Tell me what you saw

772
00:57:48.250 --> 00:57:50.250
I remember in court

773
00:57:50.292 --> 00:57:52.792
one criminal described how he tortured the victim

774
00:57:53.292 --> 00:57:55.083
forced her to drink urine and eat feces

775
00:57:55.125 --> 00:57:56.208
beat her

776
00:57:56.250 --> 00:57:57.792
burned her

777
00:57:57.833 --> 00:57:58.875
dismembered her body

778
00:57:58.917 --> 00:58:00.078
and cooked it

779
00:58:00.083 --> 00:58:01.578
While he talked

780
00:58:01.583 --> 00:58:03.375
the other two laughed

781
00:58:11.333 --> 00:58:13.292
Deep in my heart, I really wanted to believe

782
00:58:13.333 --> 00:58:14.750
they were not demons

783
00:58:14.792 --> 00:58:16.083
and would feel remorse

784
00:58:21.667 --> 00:58:24.250
2010

785
00:59:27.875 --> 00:59:29.000
Auntie

786
00:59:29.042 --> 00:59:31.162
Don’t make up alibis for Ting any more

787
00:59:31.167 --> 00:59:33.042
We have sufficient evidence

788
00:59:33.083 --> 00:59:35.167
that he’s a murderer

789
00:59:37.167 --> 00:59:38.583
Who did he kill?

790
00:59:39.042 --> 00:59:40.958
A 16-year-old girl

791
00:59:59.375 --> 01:00:00.625
When Ting was

792
01:00:00.667 --> 01:00:02.292
he was in a traffic accident

793
01:00:02.833 --> 01:00:04.875
His father drove trucks between Hong Kong
and the mainland

794
01:00:05.458 --> 01:00:06.833
He brought his wife and son

795
01:00:06.875 --> 01:00:08.417
on a trip

796
01:00:08.708 --> 01:00:10.375
The truck flipped over

797
01:00:10.417 --> 01:00:12.792
Ting watched his mother die

798
01:00:12.833 --> 01:00:15.208
I’m looking through the old files

799
01:00:16.750 --> 01:00:18.500
What are you trying to do?

800
01:00:18.542 --> 01:00:20.583
I told you to stop investigating

801
01:00:20.625 --> 01:00:24.333
Take time off to be with your daughter

802
01:00:26.375 --> 01:00:27.542
Give me one more night

803
01:00:27.583 --> 01:00:29.375
I’ll have the report on your desk by morning

804
01:00:32.875 --> 01:00:34.167
If you get sued

805
01:00:34.208 --> 01:00:36.542
for interrupting the judicial process

806
01:00:36.583 --> 01:00:38.245
I wont write letters on your behalf

807
01:00:38.250 --> 01:00:39.958
in case people think we’re having an affair

808
01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.417
That’s ridiculous

809
01:00:43.917 --> 01:00:46.333
Do I embarrass you?

810
01:00:46.375 --> 01:00:48.083
Look at yourself

811
01:00:48.125 --> 01:00:49.500
Your face is sagging

812
01:00:49.542 --> 01:00:51.417
still pretending to be young

813
01:00:51.458 --> 01:00:52.417
Really?

814
01:00:52.833 --> 01:00:53.708
Really?

815
01:00:53.750 --> 01:00:55.245
(Fatal Car Accident in Zhongshan)

816
01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:57.000
(Family of Three Involved: Mother Dies)

817
01:03:11.542 --> 01:03:13.250
Get up. It’s after 8 already

818
01:03:17.458 --> 01:03:19.042
Good morning, Madam

819
01:03:20.042 --> 01:03:22.417
Needless to say, there’s no report

820
01:03:24.625 --> 01:03:26.417
It’s on your desk

821
01:03:36.083 --> 01:03:37.250
Flora

822
01:03:39.875 --> 01:03:41.208
Yes, Madam

823
01:03:41.250 --> 01:03:43.083
Fix his grammar

824
01:03:43.125 --> 01:03:44.375
Rush it to court before 10:

825
01:03:44.417 --> 01:03:45.078
Yes

826
01:03:45.083 --> 01:03:46.245
Do you have a death-wish, bringing a cat here?

827
01:03:46.250 --> 01:03:47.625
No

828
01:03:47.667 --> 01:03:50.125
He belonged to Ting’s neighbour, an old lady

829
01:03:50.167 --> 01:03:51.875
She had a stroke

830
01:03:51.917 --> 01:03:54.333
and wants us to find him an owner

831
01:03:54.375 --> 01:03:56.375
Get Sergeant Chong to take him

832
01:03:56.417 --> 01:03:57.250
He has no other family

833
01:03:57.292 --> 01:03:58.125
That will work out

834
01:03:58.167 --> 01:04:00.083
Ask Chong to take him home

835
01:04:00.125 --> 01:04:01.458
What?

836
01:04:02.250 --> 01:04:03.583
Give him a home?

837
01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:11.958
He’s quite cute

838
01:04:14.917 --> 01:04:17.667
All right, I’ll take you in

839
01:04:17.708 --> 01:04:19.375
Greet me first

840
01:04:23.792 --> 01:04:26.208
Here’s the information on Lee Mo-yung

841
01:04:26.250 --> 01:04:27.333
you requested

842
01:04:27.375 --> 01:04:28.542
Mo-yung?

843
01:04:36.125 --> 01:04:37.458
Who is this man?

844
01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:38.833
Her boyfriend

845
01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.250
She was going to live with her elderly billionaire

846
01:04:44.292 --> 01:04:45.917
boyfriend in America

847
01:04:47.167 --> 01:04:48.250
but

848
01:04:48.292 --> 01:04:50.542
fell in love with his son

849
01:04:50.583 --> 01:04:53.125
The son got tired of her

850
01:04:53.167 --> 01:04:54.583
and let her go

851
01:04:59.833 --> 01:05:02.250
Don’t let me see your face

852
01:05:02.292 --> 01:05:04.083
How embarrassing

853
01:05:04.833 --> 01:05:07.167
It’s like those fans

854
01:05:12.458 --> 01:05:14.625
Oh, the ticket is gone!

855
01:05:17.833 --> 01:05:19.167
Where’s my ticket?

856
01:05:24.667 --> 01:05:25.792
Here

857
01:05:25.833 --> 01:05:27.083
Look

858
01:05:28.833 --> 01:05:30.333
A ticket

859
01:05:30.458 --> 01:05:32.203
costs hundreds of dollars

860
01:05:32.208 --> 01:05:33.875
Two cost over $1000,

861
01:05:34.958 --> 01:05:37.708
And three hours pass just like that

862
01:05:46.417 --> 01:05:48.000
Want to fuck me for just over $1000

863
01:06:22.083 --> 01:06:23.583
What are you doing?

864
01:06:26.875 --> 01:06:28.250
Have you gone crazy?

865
01:07:06.667 --> 01:07:08.417
You’ve done a lot of research

866
01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:11.620
Yes, per your orders

867
01:07:11.625 --> 01:07:13.500
I got a private eye to find this data

868
01:07:14.458 --> 01:07:16.792
I’ll put his bill on your desk in a few days

869
01:07:16.833 --> 01:07:18.583
No way!

870
01:07:18.625 --> 01:07:20.453
Why didn’t you discuss it with me?

871
01:07:20.458 --> 01:07:22.125
You’re so serious

872
01:07:23.333 --> 01:07:25.792
I found everything on Facebook

873
01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.667
I don’t use Facebook

874
01:07:28.708 --> 01:07:29.833
You’re so low-tech

875
01:07:29.875 --> 01:07:31.792
I don’t know how to help you

876
01:07:33.333 --> 01:07:34.667
Flora

877
01:07:36.750 --> 01:07:38.500
Help me with these English letters

878
01:07:40.292 --> 01:07:42.792
I copied them from Jiameis wall

879
01:07:46.125 --> 01:07:47.667
It looks like a password

880
01:07:48.583 --> 01:07:50.667
I think it means something

881
01:07:51.708 --> 01:07:54.250
You think I’m the FBI?

882
01:07:55.333 --> 01:07:58.042
It could be pinyin or something

883
01:08:00.667 --> 01:08:02.750
Let it go, OK?

884
01:08:02.792 --> 01:08:04.667
If it is pinyin

885
01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:07.495
there are many possibilities

886
01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:10.125
It needs a lot of work before it can be solved

887
01:08:10.708 --> 01:08:11.917
Let it go

888
01:08:11.958 --> 01:08:13.958
This case is closed

889
01:08:14.875 --> 01:08:15.875
When you have some time

890
01:08:15.917 --> 01:08:18.542
get a Facebook account

891
01:08:18.583 --> 01:08:20.042
Make some more friends

892
01:08:20.083 --> 01:08:21.333
How about this

893
01:08:21.375 --> 01:08:23.042
I’ll be the first to add you as a friend

894
01:08:23.083 --> 01:08:24.625
I’m on Facebook, too

895
01:08:26.458 --> 01:08:28.125
Add me as your friend

896
01:08:31.708 --> 01:08:33.917
First I’ve got to fix the sergeant’s grammar

897
01:08:37.083 --> 01:08:38.458
Great choice

898
01:08:41.917 --> 01:08:43.208
Give me change for all of this

899
01:08:49.042 --> 01:08:50.083
Come on

900
01:08:54.875 --> 01:08:55.833
Again

901
01:08:56.458 --> 01:08:58.583
I have no time to play with you

902
01:09:05.583 --> 01:09:06.625
Come on

903
01:09:07.583 --> 01:09:09.583
Officer, let’s call it a night

904
01:09:09.625 --> 01:09:10.542
I have to go

905
01:09:10.583 --> 01:09:12.245
I have school tomorrow

906
01:09:12.250 --> 01:09:13.500
School?

907
01:09:16.083 --> 01:09:17.833
Can police do whatever they want?

908
01:09:17.875 --> 01:09:19.375
Can police force others to play video games?

909
01:09:20.417 --> 01:09:21.708
Are you going to play?

910
01:09:22.583 --> 01:09:24.000
Fine

911
01:09:27.583 --> 01:09:29.333
You don’t look old enough

912
01:09:31.958 --> 01:09:33.250
Be serious

913
01:09:36.208 --> 01:09:38.792
Even I went to arcades when I was underage

914
01:09:39.917 --> 01:09:41.958
Who hasn’t done that before?

915
01:09:43.292 --> 01:09:45.500
You try anything when you’re young

916
01:09:46.667 --> 01:09:48.375
I stole things

917
01:09:48.417 --> 01:09:49.875
when I was young

918
01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.417
Have you taken ketamine?

919
01:10:03.250 --> 01:10:04.417
Will it make you do things

920
01:10:04.458 --> 01:10:06.250
without realizing you’re doing them?

921
01:10:13.625 --> 01:10:14.875
Play some games with me

922
01:10:20.958 --> 01:10:22.917
Have you heard of Wang Jiamei?

923
01:10:24.875 --> 01:10:27.292
Yes, $500 per hour

924
01:10:27.333 --> 01:10:28.667
$800 for two

925
01:10:28.833 --> 01:10:31.495
The first hour can be dinner

926
01:10:31.500 --> 01:10:32.708
or karaoke

927
01:10:37.667 --> 01:10:39.167
Is this your phone number?

928
01:10:40.208 --> 01:10:41.662
Tonight?

929
01:10:41.667 --> 01:10:43.917
I’m busy tonight

930
01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:48.000
What is it?

931
01:10:48.042 --> 01:10:49.328
You’re blocking the closet

932
01:10:49.333 --> 01:10:51.042
I need my clothes

933
01:10:56.667 --> 01:10:58.667
I didn’t hang up on you

934
01:10:59.458 --> 01:11:00.167
All right

935
01:11:00.208 --> 01:11:01.375
Next time, then

936
01:11:01.958 --> 01:11:03.000
Bye bye

937
01:11:09.958 --> 01:11:12.583
I need to pee. I’m in a hurry

938
01:11:19.375 --> 01:11:20.917
Where are you going at this hour?

939
01:11:20.958 --> 01:11:22.375
I have a date

940
01:11:22.792 --> 01:11:24.583
With whom?

941
01:11:24.625 --> 01:11:26.875
You wouldn’t know him even if I told you

942
01:11:30.250 --> 01:11:31.792
Come home early

943
01:11:39.083 --> 01:11:41.000
Your tone is so strange today

944
01:11:42.250 --> 01:11:44.458
I’ll be there soon. Where are you?

945
01:11:46.042 --> 01:11:48.167
OK. Bye

946
01:12:03.458 --> 01:12:05.083
Take a good look at her

947
01:12:05.125 --> 01:12:07.125
Take a good look. Why would I chase her?

948
01:12:07.167 --> 01:12:08.625
Maybe you like shit

949
01:12:08.667 --> 01:12:10.625
What if you like shit?

950
01:12:13.875 --> 01:12:14.912
Sorry, Jiamei

951
01:12:14.917 --> 01:12:17.292
I was explaining to my girlfriend

952
01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:20.875
that we met at an internet café

953
01:12:20.917 --> 01:12:22.958
We just play arcade games together

954
01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.333
But she doesn’t believe me

955
01:12:25.375 --> 01:12:27.458
She said she saw us strolling

956
01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:28.833
hand in hand

957
01:12:28.875 --> 01:12:31.167
That never happened, right?

958
01:12:32.542 --> 01:12:34.125
That’s right. It never happened

959
01:12:34.792 --> 01:12:37.625
Your girlfriend is just concerned about you

960
01:12:55.125 --> 01:12:57.125
It’s late. Why don’t you go home?

961
01:12:57.958 --> 01:12:59.292
What about you?

962
01:13:00.208 --> 01:13:01.292
That’s different

963
01:13:01.333 --> 01:13:02.958
You’re so young

964
01:13:04.583 --> 01:13:07.000
Then why don’t you go home?

965
01:13:08.125 --> 01:13:11.000
Go ahead. I’ll leave soon

966
01:13:12.375 --> 01:13:13.708
I wanted to ask

967
01:13:13.750 --> 01:13:16.500
will you come back to play?

968
01:13:18.250 --> 01:13:20.000
I’ll come if you will

969
01:13:34.167 --> 01:13:36.667
Mui, let’s go

970
01:13:41.250 --> 01:13:42.750
Bye bye

971
01:14:03.042 --> 01:14:04.703
Actually, I don’t want you to do it

972
01:14:04.708 --> 01:14:06.000
Do what?

973
01:14:06.042 --> 01:14:07.542
Your job

974
01:14:09.167 --> 01:14:11.042
I don’t charge you

975
01:14:11.083 --> 01:14:12.917
If I didn’t have clients

976
01:14:14.208 --> 01:14:15.708
I’d starve

977
01:14:18.042 --> 01:14:19.792
Do you have to put it like that?

978
01:14:39.250 --> 01:14:40.958
This is Kama

979
01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.333
You just called me

980
01:14:43.917 --> 01:14:46.042
Do you still want me to come?

981
01:14:49.708 --> 01:14:51.083
Of course

982
01:14:51.667 --> 01:14:54.208
I can treat you like I’m your girlfriend

983
01:14:56.583 --> 01:14:58.083
Send me your address

984
01:14:58.500 --> 01:15:00.167
I’ll be right over

985
01:15:02.083 --> 01:15:03.078
For an extra $500

986
01:15:03.083 --> 01:15:04.917
I can stay till morning

987
01:15:07.250 --> 01:15:09.375
All right, bye bye

988
01:15:15.792 --> 01:15:18.250
Don’t you worry about getting electrocuted?

989
01:15:20.125 --> 01:15:22.083
Do people die so easily?

990
01:16:15.333 --> 01:16:18.000
(2009: The Wang Jiamei Case Goes to Trial)

991
01:16:28.833 --> 01:16:30.833
I hurt it moving stuff a long time ago

992
01:16:35.208 --> 01:16:36.583
I didn’t ask you

993
01:17:33.250 --> 01:17:34.583
No, don’t

994
01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:38.333
Didn’t you always want this?

995
01:17:41.125 --> 01:17:42.250
Don’t

996
01:17:43.417 --> 01:17:44.667
I don’t have any condoms

997
01:17:44.708 --> 01:17:46.833
It’s OK. I’m having my period

998
01:18:59.958 --> 01:19:01.333
Take care

999
01:19:59.208 --> 01:20:01.833
(3.Painful Steps)

1000
01:20:24.250 --> 01:20:26.708
I saw it was light outside

1001
01:20:28.292 --> 01:20:32.000
and knew I had to deal with her body

1002
01:20:33.042 --> 01:20:35.208
I took a cleaver

1003
01:20:36.750 --> 01:20:38.875
and held up her body

1004
01:20:41.833 --> 01:20:45.375
Then I slit her throat

1005
01:20:45.417 --> 01:20:46.708
to let the blood out

1006
01:20:47.958 --> 01:20:50.583
About 10 or 15 minutes later

1007
01:20:51.583 --> 01:20:53.625
when the blood stopped flowing

1008
01:20:54.375 --> 01:20:56.000
I cut down

1009
01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:00.453
from her throat

1010
01:21:00.458 --> 01:21:03.083
all the way to her bellybutton

1011
01:21:04.708 --> 01:21:06.792
I didn’t know a such a thin person

1012
01:21:08.333 --> 01:21:10.208
could have so much fat

1013
01:21:10.667 --> 01:21:12.417
What the hell are you talking about?

1014
01:21:24.292 --> 01:21:26.333
I saw her organs

1015
01:21:28.500 --> 01:21:29.625
but I couldn’t tell them apart

1016
01:21:29.667 --> 01:21:32.167
which was the heart, which were the lungs

1017
01:21:33.708 --> 01:21:36.750
I just pulled them all out

1018
01:21:38.542 --> 01:21:41.042
cut them up into small pieces

1019
01:21:42.250 --> 01:21:43.583
and little by little

1020
01:21:43.625 --> 01:21:45.375
flushed them down the toilet

1021
01:21:48.792 --> 01:21:51.000
I chopped off her head

1022
01:21:54.167 --> 01:21:56.750
It took about 4 or 5 chops

1023
01:21:57.667 --> 01:21:59.000
before the head fell off

1024
01:21:59.833 --> 01:22:02.583
Then I moved on to her limbs

1025
01:22:03.917 --> 01:22:07.667
and removed the flesh

1026
01:22:11.042 --> 01:22:13.042
It took 4 or 5 chops to break the legs

1027
01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:16.875
The arms were thinner

1028
01:22:17.583 --> 01:22:20.000
just 2 or 3 chops

1029
01:22:24.333 --> 01:22:25.292
Mr. Ting

1030
01:22:25.333 --> 01:22:27.037
What are you cooking?

1031
01:22:27.042 --> 01:22:29.083
Do you need any help?

1032
01:22:31.292 --> 01:22:33.708
After dealing with her limbs

1033
01:22:35.208 --> 01:22:37.708
I decided to remove the skin

1034
01:22:40.708 --> 01:22:43.917
I pulled the skin off her face

1035
01:22:53.750 --> 01:22:55.583
but I couldn’t pull off the rest of the skin

1036
01:22:58.583 --> 01:23:00.745
because there is fat under the skin

1037
01:23:00.750 --> 01:23:02.000
I tried to cut it with the skin

1038
01:23:02.042 --> 01:23:03.375
but it didn’t work

1039
01:23:04.083 --> 01:23:07.250
So I made horizontal cuts

1040
01:23:08.417 --> 01:23:11.167
and removed the whole piece of skin

1041
01:23:12.417 --> 01:23:15.292
I saw that’s what pig butchers do

1042
01:23:15.333 --> 01:23:16.875
so I did the same thing

1043
01:23:24.083 --> 01:23:25.750
Then I got to the bones

1044
01:23:30.417 --> 01:23:31.792
The tail bone

1045
01:23:32.875 --> 01:23:34.292
was the hardest to cut

1046
01:23:35.958 --> 01:23:39.917
Then the ribs

1047
01:23:42.625 --> 01:23:45.750
I broke them with my knife tip

1048
01:23:59.833 --> 01:24:01.625
About 20 of them

1049
01:24:03.167 --> 01:24:06.208
Then the big toes

1050
01:24:07.542 --> 01:24:09.292
Maybe because they were so thick

1051
01:24:11.250 --> 01:24:13.000
they were hard to break

1052
01:24:18.625 --> 01:24:21.167
So I tried to remove the skin

1053
01:24:22.167 --> 01:24:23.995
so they would look like pigs feet

1054
01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:25.250
not human

1055
01:24:25.292 --> 01:24:27.833
Then I could take them to the market

1056
01:24:30.125 --> 01:24:31.333
I washed my hands

1057
01:24:31.375 --> 01:24:34.333
and put Jiameis head in a plastic bag

1058
01:24:42.792 --> 01:24:44.417
At about 10pm

1059
01:24:44.458 --> 01:24:47.667
I took a bus to the Kowloon City Pier

1060
01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.667
because even if there were police roadblocks

1061
01:24:53.917 --> 01:24:56.792
they seldom search buses

1062
01:24:57.875 --> 01:24:59.833
After arriving at the pier

1063
01:25:01.500 --> 01:25:03.125
I saw there were very few people

1064
01:25:04.708 --> 01:25:10.292
I tipped the bag with her head into the sea

1065
01:25:13.667 --> 01:25:15.958
Dad, how many people are there in Hong Kong?

1066
01:25:16.792 --> 01:25:18.125
7 million

1067
01:25:18.417 --> 01:25:21.542
Kill Cheung, that motherfucker!

1068
01:25:21.583 --> 01:25:23.042
Does Uncle James Wong count?

1069
01:25:23.542 --> 01:25:24.667
No, he’s dead

1070
01:25:24.708 --> 01:25:26.333
Kill Cheung, that motherfucker!

1071
01:25:26.708 --> 01:25:27.703
How about Bruce Lee?

1072
01:25:27.708 --> 01:25:29.375
There’s no heaven, no earth, no conscience!

1073
01:25:29.417 --> 01:25:30.458
Is he dead?

1074
01:25:30.500 --> 01:25:32.250
Kill Cheung, that motherfucker!

1075
01:25:32.542 --> 01:25:34.958
There’s no heaven, no earth, no conscience!

1076
01:25:36.375 --> 01:25:38.667
Kill, kill that motherfucker!

1077
01:25:39.625 --> 01:25:41.917
How about Wang Jiamei?

1078
01:25:44.917 --> 01:25:46.333
How do you know about her?

1079
01:25:47.333 --> 01:25:49.083
Mom watches you on the TV news

1080
01:25:49.125 --> 01:25:52.625
I just know someone named Wang Jiamei died

1081
01:25:54.250 --> 01:25:55.542
Your mom watches me

1082
01:25:57.333 --> 01:25:59.042
You can say that again

1083
01:25:59.083 --> 01:26:01.042
She only lets me see you

1084
01:26:01.625 --> 01:26:05.167
on the days you have ballet, violin,

1085
01:26:05.208 --> 01:26:07.000
and swimming lessons

1086
01:26:07.833 --> 01:26:09.417
Consequently,

1087
01:26:09.458 --> 01:26:11.750
I just drop you off and pick you up

1088
01:26:12.792 --> 01:26:14.958
and only see you a few hours a week

1089
01:26:16.792 --> 01:26:18.787
By the way

1090
01:26:18.792 --> 01:26:20.083
don’t keep talking about me

1091
01:26:20.125 --> 01:26:22.250
in front of your mom’s new guy

1092
01:26:22.292 --> 01:26:23.620
He’ll get jealous, you know?

1093
01:26:23.625 --> 01:26:24.542
OK

1094
01:26:24.583 --> 01:26:25.875
And

1095
01:26:25.917 --> 01:26:27.458
he may be your new dad any day now

1096
01:26:28.417 --> 01:26:29.750
I haven’t seen him

1097
01:26:29.792 --> 01:26:31.417
in a long time

1098
01:26:33.458 --> 01:26:34.750
Really?

1099
01:26:37.875 --> 01:26:39.375
What happened?

1100
01:26:39.417 --> 01:26:40.667
Finish what you were saying

1101
01:26:40.708 --> 01:26:41.917
Boss

1102
01:26:41.958 --> 01:26:44.333
I’m not your boss

1103
01:26:44.375 --> 01:26:45.620
Mom will tell me off

1104
01:26:45.625 --> 01:26:46.620
I can’t say anything

1105
01:26:46.625 --> 01:26:48.458
I don’t want to betray her

1106
01:26:49.250 --> 01:26:50.620
No

1107
01:26:50.625 --> 01:26:52.875
I’m so tired. I want to go to sleep

1108
01:27:33.167 --> 01:27:35.542
Hi, my name is Chong

1109
01:27:35.583 --> 01:27:36.917
Yes, I got it

1110
01:27:36.958 --> 01:27:38.292
Yes,Yes

1111
01:27:39.250 --> 01:27:41.125
I just roll it over my face?

1112
01:27:41.792 --> 01:27:43.292
And it really works?

1113
01:27:45.917 --> 01:27:47.750
My face will be firmer?

1114
01:28:11.875 --> 01:28:13.333
You still don’t sleep?

1115
01:28:16.792 --> 01:28:18.333
Look at yourself

1116
01:28:19.292 --> 01:28:21.042
Your hair is getting grayer

1117
01:28:22.083 --> 01:28:24.750
The bags under your eyes are getting bigger

1118
01:28:25.542 --> 01:28:27.667
Do you still stay awake until daylight?

1119
01:28:28.583 --> 01:28:29.750
If I go to bed early

1120
01:28:30.375 --> 01:28:31.625
I have nightmares

1121
01:28:33.542 --> 01:28:35.542
I’m on a dismemberment case

1122
01:28:36.958 --> 01:28:38.583
The girl’s name is Wang Jiamei

1123
01:28:40.208 --> 01:28:41.667
She was only 16 when she died

1124
01:28:41.708 --> 01:28:42.667
I know

1125
01:28:42.708 --> 01:28:44.412
I read the newspapers

1126
01:28:44.417 --> 01:28:45.792
But why would anyone

1127
01:28:46.500 --> 01:28:49.625
tell someone they just met they want to die?

1128
01:28:50.917 --> 01:28:52.833
And why would that person believe them?

1129
01:28:55.333 --> 01:28:56.833
To be honest

1130
01:28:58.375 --> 01:29:00.750
When I was young and first started dating you

1131
01:29:02.042 --> 01:29:04.125
I used to think you were so cute like this

1132
01:29:04.667 --> 01:29:06.708
I loved hearing you describe your cases

1133
01:29:07.583 --> 01:29:08.953
You were so obsessed with them

1134
01:29:08.958 --> 01:29:10.792
and I thought they were great stories

1135
01:29:12.958 --> 01:29:14.625
But after a while

1136
01:29:14.875 --> 01:29:16.708
I found it so hard

1137
01:29:25.750 --> 01:29:28.083
I just sent a text message to Jiameis dad

1138
01:29:28.125 --> 01:29:33.042
(Red Devils lost. Congrats)

1139
01:29:38.125 --> 01:29:40.542
(Dad: Jiamei, did you change phones?)

1140
01:29:40.583 --> 01:29:42.708
(Thanks)

1141
01:29:42.750 --> 01:29:44.958
(I miss you)

1142
01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:50.667
(I miss you, too)

1143
01:29:51.750 --> 01:29:55.833
(Then don’t wire me any more money)

1144
01:29:55.875 --> 01:29:58.667
(Save it for a train ticket)

1145
01:29:58.708 --> 01:30:00.875
(Come see me when you have time)

1146
01:30:39.750 --> 01:30:40.792
I didn’t dare tell him

1147
01:30:40.833 --> 01:30:42.458
his daughter is dead

1148
01:30:45.042 --> 01:30:46.333
because I know how it feels

1149
01:30:47.792 --> 01:30:50.083
for a father to miss his daughter

1150
01:30:51.208 --> 01:30:53.542
But he doesn’t know he will never

1151
01:30:55.792 --> 01:30:57.208
see Jiamei again

1152
01:31:02.125 --> 01:31:04.042
Come on

1153
01:31:04.083 --> 01:31:05.417
What’s wrong?

1154
01:31:13.750 --> 01:31:15.208
Don’t cry

1155
01:31:21.917 --> 01:31:24.083
People are staring

1156
01:31:25.208 --> 01:31:27.000
Don’t cry like that

1157
01:31:27.958 --> 01:31:29.750
You’re crying like a child

1158
01:31:34.833 --> 01:31:35.917
Hello

1159
01:31:37.083 --> 01:31:38.500
Yes

1160
01:31:39.125 --> 01:31:41.042
Mommy has gone out for a while

1161
01:31:41.625 --> 01:31:43.542
Why aren’t you asleep?

1162
01:31:44.833 --> 01:31:46.292
I’m coming back now

1163
01:31:49.208 --> 01:31:50.458
OK

1164
01:31:50.667 --> 01:31:52.167
All right

1165
01:31:52.208 --> 01:31:53.458
Bye bye

1166
01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:54.917
Bye

1167
01:31:58.375 --> 01:31:59.792
I have to go

1168
01:32:01.417 --> 01:32:02.583
Sorry

1169
01:32:02.625 --> 01:32:04.000
to bother you so late at night

1170
01:32:05.333 --> 01:32:06.458
In any case

1171
01:32:06.958 --> 01:32:08.292
don’t think too much about it

1172
01:32:12.250 --> 01:32:13.417
Sheung

1173
01:32:30.000 --> 01:32:32.542
Our daughter’s birthday party is next week

1174
01:32:32.583 --> 01:32:33.917
She wants to invite you

1175
01:32:35.250 --> 01:32:36.542
Will it be awkward for you?

1176
01:32:38.208 --> 01:32:41.042
If you have time, get some sleep

1177
01:32:41.167 --> 01:32:42.958
You look like a ghost

1178
01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.917
You’ll scare our daughter’s classmates

1179
01:32:56.625 --> 01:33:00.167
Mister, let me pay your tab

1180
01:33:14.458 --> 01:33:15.542
Sir

1181
01:33:19.458 --> 01:33:21.417
A memo from our Inspector

1182
01:33:21.458 --> 01:33:22.958
for me to ask Ting Tsz-chung some questions

1183
01:33:23.417 --> 01:33:24.833
to interrogate him

1184
01:33:27.500 --> 01:33:29.458
Sir, do you know the criminal well?

1185
01:33:33.042 --> 01:33:35.167
Your name is already on

1186
01:33:35.208 --> 01:33:36.537
Ting’s visitor list

1187
01:33:36.542 --> 01:33:38.667
You can come at any time

1188
01:33:39.583 --> 01:33:41.375
Please go upstairs and wait

1189
01:33:48.417 --> 01:33:49.417
Well?

1190
01:33:50.375 --> 01:33:51.542
Are you doing OK in here?

1191
01:33:55.083 --> 01:33:56.625
I brought you some books

1192
01:33:57.333 --> 01:33:59.042
You can read them when you’re bored

1193
01:34:06.333 --> 01:34:07.542
This

1194
01:34:08.250 --> 01:34:09.583
is the most important

1195
01:34:15.833 --> 01:34:16.792
Thank you

1196
01:34:16.833 --> 01:34:20.042
The officer said there was something else
you wanted to know

1197
01:34:20.083 --> 01:34:21.333
What do you want to ask?

1198
01:34:21.375 --> 01:34:22.583
I don’t want to ask you anything

1199
01:34:22.625 --> 01:34:24.458
I made it up. It was just an excuse

1200
01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:26.958
I came specially to see you

1201
01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:28.875
Who knew you had already put my name on your list?

1202
01:34:28.917 --> 01:34:31.250
I don’t have any friends

1203
01:34:37.917 --> 01:34:42.125
These tabloids tell a good story

1204
01:34:42.875 --> 01:34:44.292
and in great detail

1205
01:34:48.625 --> 01:34:50.458
Actually, there’s a question
I’ve always wanted to ask

1206
01:34:51.208 --> 01:34:53.083
Didn’t you say you had nothing to ask me?

1207
01:34:57.792 --> 01:35:00.208
Since it wasn’t entirely due to the ketamine

1208
01:35:00.250 --> 01:35:01.625
and it wasn’t about money

1209
01:35:03.083 --> 01:35:04.458
or personal revenge

1210
01:35:05.375 --> 01:35:06.875
orS&M

1211
01:35:08.833 --> 01:35:10.083
then why?

1212
01:35:13.125 --> 01:35:15.917
I don’t understand what it is you want to know

1213
01:35:18.958 --> 01:35:20.792
On 13 May 1987

1214
01:35:21.333 --> 01:35:25.333
you and your parents went to Zhongshan

1215
01:35:26.167 --> 01:35:28.833
On the way back there was a bad accident

1216
01:35:28.875 --> 01:35:30.417
Your mom died on site

1217
01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:34.000
I asked your father when he was alive

1218
01:35:35.750 --> 01:35:37.375
Officer, I’ve checked the oil and water

1219
01:35:37.417 --> 01:35:38.328
Thank you

1220
01:35:38.333 --> 01:35:39.125
The truck can be driven?

1221
01:35:39.167 --> 01:35:40.292
Yes

1222
01:35:40.667 --> 01:35:42.083
Please sign for it

1223
01:35:43.875 --> 01:35:48.292
The doctor says I’m dying

1224
01:35:49.333 --> 01:35:52.667
What am I going to do with a truck?

1225
01:35:54.792 --> 01:35:56.662
Ting Tsz-chug said

1226
01:35:56.667 --> 01:35:58.042
to give you

1227
01:35:59.083 --> 01:36:00.958
everything

1228
01:36:07.250 --> 01:36:08.667
Mr. Ting

1229
01:36:08.708 --> 01:36:10.375
I have a question for you

1230
01:36:11.833 --> 01:36:13.583
about your wife’s traffic accident

1231
01:36:13.625 --> 01:36:14.833
He introduced me to

1232
01:36:14.875 --> 01:36:16.833
the psychiatrist Dr. Yeung

1233
01:36:18.042 --> 01:36:19.833
Dr. Yeung still remembers your case

1234
01:36:21.458 --> 01:36:22.792
He was very worried

1235
01:36:23.375 --> 01:36:26.537
you would suffer from
post-traumatic stress disorder

1236
01:36:26.542 --> 01:36:28.208
especially because children

1237
01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:30.042
mistakenly feel that

1238
01:36:30.083 --> 01:36:32.500
they are responsible for their parent’s death

1239
01:36:34.875 --> 01:36:36.375
He assumed that

1240
01:36:39.333 --> 01:36:41.083
because your mom died so young

1241
01:36:41.125 --> 01:36:42.412
you grew up

1242
01:36:42.417 --> 01:36:43.958
not trusting women

1243
01:36:46.250 --> 01:36:47.875
Also your relationship with Mo-yung

1244
01:36:48.458 --> 01:36:50.500
made you hate women

1245
01:36:54.667 --> 01:36:56.250
Do you really want to know so badly

1246
01:36:56.292 --> 01:36:58.667
why I killed Wang Jiamei?

1247
01:37:02.250 --> 01:37:04.167
I don’t want to know why you killed her

1248
01:37:07.167 --> 01:37:09.458
I just want to know why it happened

1249
01:37:09.500 --> 01:37:11.875
You’re overthinking it

1250
01:37:15.708 --> 01:37:18.375
I didn’t hate Wang Jiamei at all

1251
01:37:20.833 --> 01:37:23.083
Why would I hate her?

1252
01:37:25.292 --> 01:37:27.250
In fact, I liked her

1253
01:37:31.792 --> 01:37:34.000
I don’t hate women at all

1254
01:37:36.167 --> 01:37:37.833
What I hate are human beings

1255
01:37:43.625 --> 01:37:46.417
I didn’t want Jiamei to be one, so I killed her

1256
01:37:48.083 --> 01:37:49.833
You tore the skin off her face

1257
01:37:51.083 --> 01:37:52.708
because you didn’t want her to be human?

1258
01:38:11.042 --> 01:38:11.833
But I didn’t know

1259
01:38:15.958 --> 01:38:18.167
I killed one more person

1260
01:38:19.250 --> 01:38:21.708
Jiamei was pregnant

1261
01:38:42.542 --> 01:38:44.417
Did she know she was pregnant?

1262
01:38:47.667 --> 01:38:49.167
No more questions

1263
01:38:52.042 --> 01:38:53.333
No more questions

1264
01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:00.500
No more questions

1265
01:39:01.375 --> 01:39:02.708
No more

1266
01:39:55.625 --> 01:39:58.292
1986

1267
01:40:34.292 --> 01:40:36.000
(Chung: Are you Kama?)

1268
01:40:37.583 --> 01:40:39.287
(Kama: Yes, hi.)

1269
01:40:39.292 --> 01:40:41.083
(Are you in Hong Kong?)

1270
01:40:41.125 --> 01:40:43.125
(Chung: Why do you ask if I’m in Hong Kong?)

1271
01:40:45.375 --> 01:40:48.667
(Kama: I can’t work for you
if you’re not in Hong Kong)

1272
01:40:51.708 --> 01:40:54.042
(Chung: Your signature line)

1273
01:40:54.083 --> 01:40:55.875
(‘Your face is slightly blushing,)

1274
01:40:55.917 --> 01:40:57.708
(a red bow in your hair,)

1275
01:40:57.750 --> 01:40:59.292
(It’s exactly that moment,)

1276
01:40:59.333 --> 01:41:01.083
(the July in my memory’)

1277
01:41:01.125 --> 01:41:02.667
(what’s that from?)

1278
01:41:04.083 --> 01:41:06.833
(Kama: The lyrics to a song sung by Sammi Cheng)

1279
01:41:06.875 --> 01:41:09.333
(Sis and I listened to it while learning Cantonese)

1280
01:41:10.625 --> 01:41:12.625
(Kama: Sammi is my sister’s idol)

1281
01:41:12.667 --> 01:41:14.333
(I started to like her, too)

1282
01:41:14.375 --> 01:41:16.875
(I know she has many fans in Hong Kong)

1283
01:41:17.833 --> 01:41:19.750
(Kama: I am envious of her)

1284
01:41:19.792 --> 01:41:22.000
(It’s sad when no one sees you)

1285
01:41:23.750 --> 01:41:25.875
(Chung: I’d rather not be seen)

1286
01:41:25.917 --> 01:41:27.750
(because I’m very ugly)

1287
01:41:29.167 --> 01:41:31.417
(Kama: I’m not beautiful, either)

1288
01:41:31.458 --> 01:41:33.167
(Chung: I’m sure I’m uglier than you.)

1289
01:41:33.208 --> 01:41:34.667
(I’m very fat)

1290
01:41:35.292 --> 01:41:38.333
(Kama: Let’s hope we’re not disappointed
when we meet)

1291
01:41:46.708 --> 01:41:48.708
(Chung: Isn’t it too late for you to be up?)

1292
01:41:51.167 --> 01:41:54.000
(Kama: I’m not sleepy when I chat with you)

1293
01:41:55.875 --> 01:41:57.500
(Chung: Me, too)

1294
01:41:59.542 --> 01:42:01.375
(Kama: It’s my turn to ask questions)

1295
01:42:03.875 --> 01:42:06.083
(Kama: What would you want to be reincarnated as?)

1296
01:42:06.708 --> 01:42:08.417
(Chung: I’ve never thought about it)

1297
01:42:08.458 --> 01:42:12.042
(but I don’t want to be a human. It’s boring.)

1298
01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:14.125
(What about you?)

1299
01:42:14.167 --> 01:42:15.537
(Kama: I believe in God)

1300
01:42:15.542 --> 01:42:17.708
(We will all go to Heaven when we die)

1301
01:42:17.750 --> 01:42:20.417
(In Heaven we can do anything we want)

1302
01:42:21.583 --> 01:42:24.917
(Chung: My turn: are you afraid to die?)

1303
01:42:27.208 --> 01:42:28.500
(Kama: No)

1304
01:42:28.542 --> 01:42:31.875
(Sometimes I think it would be nice to die)

1305
01:42:31.917 --> 01:42:33.208
(Chung: Why?)

1306
01:42:35.250 --> 01:42:38.917
(Kama: Life is painful and hateful.)

1307
01:42:38.958 --> 01:42:42.583
(You always have to think
about how to live better)

1308
01:42:43.583 --> 01:42:47.078
(Kama: I want to be tough, but its not easy)

1309
01:42:47.083 --> 01:42:49.292
(especially when I’m alone)

1310
01:43:05.583 --> 01:43:07.125
(Chung: It’s morning)

1311
01:43:08.958 --> 01:43:12.708
(Kama: This proves the world moves on)

1312
01:43:44.333 --> 01:43:49.042
(Chung: Kama, shall we meet today?)

1313
01:44:00.917 --> 01:44:02.167
Come in

1314
01:44:03.500 --> 01:44:04.917
Have a seat

1315
01:44:27.542 --> 01:44:29.203
What’s wrong?

1316
01:44:29.208 --> 01:44:31.375
Are you disappointed to see me?

1317
01:44:31.417 --> 01:44:32.583


1318
01:44:32.625 --> 01:44:34.375
You’re prettier than I imagined

1319
01:44:35.083 --> 01:44:38.042
You must have imagined me as an ogre

1320
01:44:46.083 --> 01:44:47.375
And me?

1321
01:44:48.708 --> 01:44:50.292
Am I really ugly?

1322
01:44:53.833 --> 01:44:55.292
You’re... not ugly

1323
01:44:58.375 --> 01:45:01.583
You look like Streck

1324
01:45:04.792 --> 01:45:08.042
That green cartoon guy

1325
01:45:08.083 --> 01:45:09.458
He’s big and strong

1326
01:45:11.542 --> 01:45:12.875
Shrek?

1327
01:45:13.667 --> 01:45:15.792
Yeah, Shrek

1328
01:45:46.125 --> 01:45:47.917
This is much more comfortable

1329
01:46:14.083 --> 01:46:15.917
I like you

1330
01:46:21.958 --> 01:46:24.500
You’re gross

1331
01:46:24.542 --> 01:46:26.292
This is the first time we’ve met

1332
01:46:26.333 --> 01:46:28.167
How can you like me?

1333
01:46:43.375 --> 01:46:45.833
Why don’t I read you a verse from the Bible?

1334
01:46:46.708 --> 01:46:48.500
Pardon me if I do badly

1335
01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.500
I like this verse

1336
01:46:58.083 --> 01:47:02.042
(1 Timothy 4:4)

1337
01:47:10.958 --> 01:47:12.083
You?

1338
01:47:27.000 --> 01:47:30.375
For everything God created is good

1339
01:47:30.417 --> 01:47:32.417
and nothing is to be rejected

1340
01:47:32.458 --> 01:47:33.750
if it is received with thanksgiving

1341
01:47:33.792 --> 01:47:34.917
(1 Timothy 4:4)

1342
01:48:21.292 --> 01:48:22.750
I really want to die

1343
01:48:25.542 --> 01:48:27.250
I really want to die

1344
01:48:28.833 --> 01:48:30.583
I really want to die

1345
01:48:31.958 --> 01:48:33.583
I really want to die

1346
01:48:38.417 --> 01:48:39.667
OK

1347
01:48:40.458 --> 01:48:41.958
I’ll help you

1348
01:49:17.667 --> 01:49:19.167
What’s wrong?

1349
01:49:30.042 --> 01:49:31.917
Aren’t you going to help me?

1350
01:49:55.958 --> 01:49:58.375
Unforgettable days

1351
01:49:58.417 --> 01:50:03.500
Faded impressions of my home

1352
01:50:04.167 --> 01:50:07.458
In your diary you said I’m like

1353
01:50:07.500 --> 01:50:11.417
an infatuated child, looking at the world

1354
01:50:11.458 --> 01:50:14.917
But that sky above the canopy

1355
01:50:14.958 --> 01:50:18.708
wasn’t it the same back then?

1356
01:50:18.750 --> 01:50:24.000
That day I didn’t understand your words

1357
01:50:25.125 --> 01:50:32.292
Now I continue making a busy life for myself

1358
01:50:32.667 --> 01:50:39.375
But I dream of being a simple person again

1359
01:50:40.458 --> 01:50:43.912
I turn back and ask the sky

1360
01:50:43.917 --> 01:50:47.583
Can life ever be easy?

1361
01:50:47.625 --> 01:50:53.500
Do you understand this at all?

1362
01:50:54.500 --> 01:50:56.250
Your face is slightly blushing

1363
01:50:56.292 --> 01:50:58.458
a red bow in your hair

1364
01:50:58.500 --> 01:51:00.412
It’s exactly that moment

1365
01:51:00.417 --> 01:51:02.500
the July in my memory

1366
01:51:02.542 --> 01:51:04.458
Are the trees very tall?

1367
01:51:04.500 --> 01:51:06.745
Do you remember that day?

1368
01:51:06.750 --> 01:51:10.625
Do you remember the day we parted?

1369
01:51:10.667 --> 01:51:12.250
We met but had nothing to say

1370
01:51:12.292 --> 01:51:14.333
Continue being wilful, child

1371
01:51:14.375 --> 01:51:17.792
Laugh if you’re happy

1372
01:51:18.542 --> 01:51:20.458
Let those lost feelings

1373
01:51:20.500 --> 01:51:22.708
enter my body again

1374
01:51:22.750 --> 01:51:28.625
Have another drink before we search for Neverland

1375
01:51:48.083 --> 01:51:49.875
For passengers who are going to alight midway

1376
01:51:49.917 --> 01:51:52.208
Please get ready in advance

1377
01:52:14.500 --> 01:52:15.625
Mom

1378
01:52:18.917 --> 01:52:20.208
Jiamei, you’re late

1379
01:52:21.125 --> 01:52:23.208
Don’t you think that joke is lame?

1380
01:52:24.917 --> 01:52:27.125
Not so hard. It hurts, Sis

1381
01:52:28.125 --> 01:52:29.667
Why are you crying, Sis?

1382
01:52:30.458 --> 01:52:32.042
Aren’t you happy I came?

1383
01:52:32.333 --> 01:52:33.667
Then Ill go back

1384
01:52:35.125 --> 01:52:37.583
(4. A Room with a View)

1385
01:52:38.500 --> 01:52:43.125
(Mandarin Pinyin Search)

1386
01:52:43.542 --> 01:52:47.958
(A room with a view)

1387
01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.583
2012

1388
01:53:39.458 --> 01:53:40.745
Daughter, what’s this character mean?

1389
01:53:40.750 --> 01:53:42.125
Shoot

1390
01:53:46.333 --> 01:53:47.167
And this?

1391
01:53:47.208 --> 01:53:48.083
Short

1392
01:53:48.125 --> 01:53:49.542
What if we switched them around?

1393
01:53:51.208 --> 01:53:53.333
In shoot, this body is only an inch tall

1394
01:53:53.917 --> 01:53:54.750
So shoot really is short

1395
01:53:54.792 --> 01:53:56.083
Yes

1396
01:53:56.875 --> 01:53:58.292
This part of short

1397
01:53:58.333 --> 01:54:00.375
means arrow

1398
01:54:00.417 --> 01:54:02.542
It’s facing a woman made of straw

1399
01:54:04.250 --> 01:54:05.375
That’s right. How come it’s like that?

1400
01:54:05.417 --> 01:54:07.875
That’s right; why is it like that?

1401
01:54:07.917 --> 01:54:09.167
You see

1402
01:54:09.208 --> 01:54:11.292
don’t judge a book by its cover, OK?

1403
01:54:11.625 --> 01:54:13.083
That one seems to be looking at us

1404
01:54:13.750 --> 01:54:15.125
and saying hello

1405
01:54:15.167 --> 01:54:17.667
This is our American Flamingo

1406
01:54:17.708 --> 01:54:19.792
Over there, we have some mammals

1407
01:54:19.833 --> 01:54:21.500
You can go look at them

1408
01:54:25.792 --> 01:54:27.833
Wan Si-wei, it’s time to eat

1409
01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:29.208
What is your name?

1410
01:54:29.250 --> 01:54:30.792
I’m Wan Si-wei

1411
01:54:31.500 --> 01:54:32.833
Wan Si-wei

1412
01:54:34.208 --> 01:54:35.708
Be brave

1413
01:54:37.083 --> 01:54:38.417
Tell me what you saw

1414
01:54:56.875 --> 01:54:58.542
Look at that one

1415
01:55:06.250 --> 01:55:07.375
Officer Chong

1416
01:55:09.167 --> 01:55:11.792
I was just passing and thought I’d stop by

1417
01:55:12.375 --> 01:55:14.042
I never imagined you would visit us

1418
01:55:14.083 --> 01:55:15.333
Please sit

1419
01:55:23.833 --> 01:55:25.250
It’s very tasty

1420
01:55:25.292 --> 01:55:27.458
It’s peanut, black-eyed pea, and chicken’s feet soup

1421
01:55:27.500 --> 01:55:28.375
It’s good for you

1422
01:55:28.417 --> 01:55:30.042
You run around so much

1423
01:55:30.083 --> 01:55:31.500
It will strengthen your legs

1424
01:55:38.875 --> 01:55:42.375
Jiamei has been dead for two years

1425
01:55:44.083 --> 01:55:46.333
Six months after Jiamei died

1426
01:55:46.375 --> 01:55:48.208
Jiali got pregnant

1427
01:55:50.083 --> 01:55:52.203
I don’t know what I did wrong in a previous life

1428
01:55:52.208 --> 01:55:54.167
Both daughters are so immature

1429
01:55:54.208 --> 01:55:56.042
hanging with the wrong crowd

1430
01:55:59.542 --> 01:56:02.208
You have a daughter, don’t you?

1431
01:56:02.375 --> 01:56:03.370
How do you know that?

1432
01:56:03.375 --> 01:56:05.042
I heard from your colleague

1433
01:56:05.083 --> 01:56:06.167
Which colleague?

1434
01:56:06.208 --> 01:56:07.542
The one who smokes a lot

1435
01:56:10.792 --> 01:56:12.542
That’s right, Officer Chong

1436
01:56:13.417 --> 01:56:16.542
Go out with Jiali when you have time

1437
01:56:17.083 --> 01:56:18.245
If she could

1438
01:56:18.250 --> 01:56:19.542
date you

1439
01:56:19.583 --> 01:56:21.250
then I could relax

1440
01:56:24.417 --> 01:56:26.625
See, you’re already making eyes at each other

1441
01:56:27.500 --> 01:56:28.958
Another bowl of soup?

1442
01:56:29.000 --> 01:56:30.917
No, thanks. I’m full

1443
01:56:30.958 --> 01:56:32.583
After this chicken’s foot, I’ll be completely full

1444
01:56:32.625 --> 01:56:33.708
You’re full?

1445
01:56:33.750 --> 01:56:35.042
Good

1446
01:56:35.083 --> 01:56:37.083
Jiali, put the baby down

1447
01:56:37.125 --> 01:56:38.625
Take a walk with Officer Chong

1448
01:56:38.667 --> 01:56:39.708
Go, go

1449
01:56:39.750 --> 01:56:40.833
Another walk?

1450
01:56:40.875 --> 01:56:42.750
I’ve been out all day with

1451
01:56:43.417 --> 01:56:44.583
my daughter and ex-wife

1452
01:56:44.625 --> 01:56:45.792
all day long

1453
01:56:46.583 --> 01:56:47.750
I’m exhausted

1454
01:56:48.583 --> 01:56:49.917
So there’s no chance

1455
01:56:49.958 --> 01:56:51.375
You should have told me sooner

1456
01:56:51.417 --> 01:56:53.583
I just wasted my breath

1457
01:57:06.625 --> 01:57:08.458
You want me to take a picture of you again?

1458
01:57:09.250 --> 01:57:11.333
How about I take one with you?

1459
01:57:46.208 --> 01:57:48.000
I’ve always wanted to ask

1460
01:57:49.583 --> 01:57:51.125
Who is this?

1461
01:57:52.208 --> 01:57:55.208
Actually, we don’t know who she is

1462
01:57:55.917 --> 01:57:57.375
Years ago

1463
01:57:57.417 --> 01:57:59.828
we were shopping in Dongguan

1464
01:57:59.833 --> 01:58:01.625
and saw a photo salon

1465
01:58:02.125 --> 01:58:03.917
The pictures in the window were so nice

1466
01:58:03.958 --> 01:58:05.833
Jiamei wanted a portrait

1467
01:58:05.875 --> 01:58:07.958
but we couldn’t afford it

1468
01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:11.995
We envied her for having such a nice photo

1469
01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:16.000
so we begged the owner to sell us this photo

1470
01:58:16.375 --> 01:58:19.375
The owner thought Jiamei was very strange

1471
01:58:25.208 --> 01:58:26.792
2007

1472
01:58:26.833 --> 01:58:28.042
Smile

1473
01:58:29.667 --> 01:58:30.958
One, two, three

1474
01:58:31.125 --> 01:58:32.208
Again

1475
01:58:33.667 --> 01:58:34.875
Smile

1476
01:58:35.792 --> 01:58:37.042
Smile

1477
01:58:40.375 --> 01:58:46.000
(In memory of Jiamei)
