1
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,333
After twenty days of continuous bombing,

2
00:02:07,583 --> 00:02:10,003
Nanking finally fell to the Japanese.

3
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,040
It was December the 13th, 1937.

4
00:02:13,583 --> 00:02:14,373
I remember

5
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:16,083
everyone was running that day,

6
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,711
but no one could escape that heavy fog.

7
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,575
Major Li only had a few men left.

8
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:28,461
Nanking was no longer able to put up a fight,

9
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,751
and those left behind, ran for their lives.

10
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,170
Stop counting.

11
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:01,833
Shu and two others are missing.

12
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,791
Let us in!

13
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:43,418
There's no room!

14
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,503
Find your own place to hide!

15
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:47,331
I said, there's no more room!

16
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:49,286
Let's go.

17
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:03,831
Keep going!

18
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:18,995
Hey.

19
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:20,918
There are people inside.

20
00:04:21,333 --> 00:04:21,923
Who is there?

21
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:25,618
Come out!

22
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,248
Bastards!

23
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,456
Go to hell!

24
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,075
Stop!

25
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:43,998
Turn around!

26
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,120
Don't move!

27
00:05:52,125 --> 00:05:52,995
American.

28
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,080
From the refuge.

29
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:54,790
What?

30
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,080
American.

31
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:57,788
Not soldier.

32
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:05,368
John Miller.

33
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:06,541
Raise your hands!

34
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:07,923
Working at the church.

35
00:06:08,291 --> 00:06:09,291
Raise your hands!

36
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,615
I said raise your hands!

37
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:46,003
Separated...

38
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:49,366
You separated from your families?

39
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,460
You...

40
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,075
families...

41
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:56,416
separated?

42
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,868
I'm...

43
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:00,078
going to...

44
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,293
Winchester Cathedral.

45
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:05,868
You know where it is?

46
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,075
Where?

47
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,083
Mister.

48
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:22,333
Did you say...

49
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:24,538
Did you say "mister?"

50
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:25,745
Who said "mister?"

51
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:27,711
You speak English?

52
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,963
We are from Winchester Cathedral.

53
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:33,003
Say that again.

54
00:07:34,041 --> 00:07:36,541
We are from Winchester Cathedral.

55
00:07:39,416 --> 00:07:40,076
You're kidding?

56
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,618
We are students at the convent.

57
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,250
You going there?

58
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:46,786
Why do you want to go there?

59
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:50,415
I'm helping to bury your father.

60
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,416
Well, not your father father...

61
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:54,253
Father Ingleman.

62
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:55,366
Father Ingleman, yeah.

63
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,080
I'm helping burying him.

64
00:07:57,916 --> 00:07:59,916
Father Ingleman, I'm sending him off...

65
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,118
to heaven or wherever.

66
00:08:06,750 --> 00:08:07,790
You show me the way?

67
00:08:47,708 --> 00:08:48,288
Peng,

68
00:08:48,458 --> 00:08:49,498
move to the flank,

69
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,290
prepare to engage.

70
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,043
Damn it, are you deaf?

71
00:08:54,291 --> 00:08:54,961
Major Li,

72
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,293
we are the last ones left.

73
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,286
We should leave the city now.

74
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:02,208
Keep fighting.

75
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,250
Yes sir.

76
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,416
Got you!

77
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:16,713
Let's go.

78
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:17,415
Yes sir.

79
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:27,500
That way!

80
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:05,871
Up there, on the right!

81
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,963
On the left! Fire!

82
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:24,788
Cover them!

83
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,325
The Chinese army didn't have adequate weapons

84
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,253
to destroy the enemy's tanks,

85
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:52,996
so they employed a tactic from ancient warfare.

86
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,371
They formed a human shield

87
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:57,673
to get a bomb close to the tanks.

88
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,501
At the time, the Chinese people

89
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,960
couldn't bear the thought of losing their country,

90
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:03,871
and such selfless acts were not uncommon.

91
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,120
Zhen!

92
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,290
Let me go!

93
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:29,996
Zhen!

94
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:35,456
Come on!

95
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:05,831
Father Ingleman...

96
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,043
fly away.

97
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:08,075
Fly away?

98
00:17:09,375 --> 00:17:12,115
On here, Japanese, bomb.

99
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:15,115
- He flew away with the bomb, right.
- Yes.

100
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:18,291
Why was the deceased out here?

101
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:20,786
- Gu. All because of Gu.
- Gu?

102
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:22,828
He said, bad smell.

103
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,330
He moved the body here.

104
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,330
Who's Gu?

105
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,456
Gu is our cook.

106
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,003
He ran away.

107
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,788
He leaves some students here.

108
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:34,368
Some students took away by parents.

109
00:17:34,958 --> 00:17:36,998
Some students nowhere to go.

110
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,423
So who's inside?

111
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:41,915
Just you and the girls?

112
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:43,830
Just you and the girls.

113
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:48,455
Even without a body,

114
00:17:49,375 --> 00:17:50,245
you gotta pay me.

115
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:51,330
No.

116
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,870
No... You gotta pay me.

117
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:54,501
No.

118
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,081
That's the rule.

119
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:57,998
There's nothing I can do about it.

120
00:17:58,708 --> 00:17:59,498
With what I came through,

121
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:00,998
I should raise the price.

122
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:02,423
So is the money inside?

123
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,373
No. No money.

124
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,921
Money? Inside?

125
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:06,173
No.

126
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:07,208
Come on.

127
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:08,751
There's no money inside?

128
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:09,326
No.

129
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,080
Let's look.

130
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:11,671
It's a Catholic church.

131
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,253
There's gotta be some cash inside.

132
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:13,996
No.

133
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:14,921
No?

134
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:16,373
You say anything but no?

135
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:19,535
Can you fix truck?

136
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:22,498
Help us.

137
00:18:23,125 --> 00:18:24,115
Leave Nanking.

138
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,210
Fix this truck?

139
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:27,245
For free?

140
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:29,288
No.

141
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:32,206
I can take parts, sell parts.

142
00:18:32,375 --> 00:18:33,205
You got tools?

143
00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:34,495
No.

144
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:35,920
Let's get inside.

145
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:41,581
Zhen didn't even make a noise.

146
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,541
Even when they stabbed her over and over,

147
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,366
yet she didn't make a noise.

148
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,786
It's all my fault.

149
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:54,415
It's not your fault.

150
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,326
It is your fault.

151
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,416
Your father promised to take us

152
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:02,003
on a boat and leave Nanking.

153
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,040
Where is he?

154
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,666
He ran off.

155
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:06,373
We waited and waited

156
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,791
and now the Japanese are here.

157
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:10,791
Now the Japanese are everywhere,

158
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,038
and it's too late to go to the refuge.

159
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,543
Zhen died because of your father!

160
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,080
Shut up!

161
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,793
What are you doing?

162
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,003
Stop!

163
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:27,960
Stop fighting!

164
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,825
Hey.

165
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:33,541
Hey! Stop!

166
00:19:34,708 --> 00:19:35,368
Stop!

167
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,710
I'm John. Hi.

168
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,460
I'm American.

169
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:45,623
He's the mortician for Father's funeral.

170
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:51,578
I know it's hard.

171
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,955
But you've gotta stop fighting everybody.

172
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:56,370
You know you two... you've seen enough...

173
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:59,290
seen enough tragedy for a lifetime today.

174
00:20:07,416 --> 00:20:08,206
I can't... um...

175
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,003
I'm not good with kids.

176
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:10,996
Let's go.

177
00:20:11,708 --> 00:20:14,078
You want some flour? You like some flour?

178
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,830
- Make some bread for the girls.
- Buns.

179
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:18,710
Buns.

180
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:19,865
Buns, whatever.

181
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,670
Let's go find the collection box.

182
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:28,463
Where?

183
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,041
- Upstairs?
- No.

184
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:35,501
Oh, nice.

185
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:38,081
Forget going back to the refuge,

186
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,330
I think I'm bunking here tonight.

187
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,371
He's grim, who's that?

188
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:50,915
Is that Father Ingleman?

189
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:51,705
Yes.

190
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:54,080
These North Europeans they're all like,

191
00:20:54,250 --> 00:20:56,500
you know, tuna, playwrights,

192
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:58,080
not much fun.

193
00:20:58,708 --> 00:20:59,918
Look at that face,

194
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:02,873
he's ruining the...

195
00:21:03,708 --> 00:21:05,788
What do you call it? Feng... Fengshui?

196
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:09,368
I can't have a priest staring at me

197
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:11,713
- while I'm sleeping.
- No...

198
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:13,870
My father.

199
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:17,205
Me...

200
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:19,365
orphan...

201
00:21:19,916 --> 00:21:20,786
adopted.

202
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:21,705
I'm sorry.

203
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:22,786
But I just...

204
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,958
It's not good for me to have a priest

205
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:27,915
staring at me while I'm sleeping.

206
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,000
I can't.

207
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:32,785
Please, I gotta just... there, better.

208
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,788
You got any drink around here?

209
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:35,538
No.

210
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,920
You're a church. You got wine, something?

211
00:21:38,083 --> 00:21:38,673
Nothing.

212
00:21:39,041 --> 00:21:39,671
Nothing?

213
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,078
- No.
- No, no...

214
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,248
That's a shaving kit.

215
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:55,575
What a jerk!

216
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:58,211
I said you are a jerk!

217
00:21:59,791 --> 00:22:00,921
What did you say your name was?

218
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:02,580
George Chen.

219
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:03,915
George.

220
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:05,246
Tomorrow,

221
00:22:06,416 --> 00:22:07,576
you fix truck,

222
00:22:08,833 --> 00:22:09,463
help us.

223
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:12,500
Fix truck?

224
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,373
No money!

225
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,001
Money, George.

226
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:24,788
Gu.

227
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,748
Open the door, it's Ling.

228
00:22:27,125 --> 00:22:28,035
Can you hear me

229
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:30,955
Gu.

230
00:22:31,125 --> 00:22:31,995
Open up.

231
00:22:32,833 --> 00:22:34,003
It's Ling.

232
00:22:34,416 --> 00:22:35,496
Did you really make a deal with him?

233
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:36,366
Of course.

234
00:22:36,541 --> 00:22:38,001
Otherwise I wouldn't have brought you here.

235
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:40,618
Gu.

236
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:42,081
Open the door, it's Ling.

237
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,000
Gu, have you gone deaf?

238
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,330
Someone's here.

239
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,790
Where's Gu? Ask him to come out.

240
00:22:47,958 --> 00:22:49,118
Go to the refuge on the west side.

241
00:22:49,291 --> 00:22:51,121
Leave now, go to the refuge.

242
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:53,291
No, we're here for Gu.

243
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:54,288
Gu's not here.

244
00:22:54,458 --> 00:22:55,618
Bullshit! Get out of my way!

245
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:56,670
Gu told me,

246
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,463
this church is under Western protection.

247
00:22:58,625 --> 00:22:59,955
The Japanese can't come in.

248
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:02,325
Bastard! I served Gu all night for free,

249
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:03,500
he promised to let us stay.

250
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:04,706
Ask that bastard Gu to come out!

251
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:05,615
He's really not here.

252
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:06,291
How come?

253
00:23:06,458 --> 00:23:07,618
He ran off this morning.

254
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:09,333
You should go to the refuge.

255
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:30,785
We're not leaving.

256
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,368
Hey! How dare you!

257
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,210
Hurry.

258
00:23:49,375 --> 00:23:50,495
Go to the refuge!

259
00:23:50,916 --> 00:23:51,746
To the refuge!

260
00:23:51,916 --> 00:23:54,036
The refuge doesn't even
have space left for maggots.

261
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:56,868
Please, have some mercy and let us in.

262
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,830
Don't jump.

263
00:24:26,125 --> 00:24:27,535
They're from the red-light district.

264
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:28,831
What's that?

265
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:30,416
It means brothel.

266
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,250
They were the famous women of the Qin Huai River.

267
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:40,963
The myths surrounding them

268
00:24:41,291 --> 00:24:43,581
were as ancient as the city of Nanking.

269
00:24:51,458 --> 00:24:53,418
That's a Westerner!

270
00:24:53,708 --> 00:24:54,418
Is he a priest?

271
00:24:54,583 --> 00:24:55,713
No way.

272
00:24:55,875 --> 00:24:57,415
What kind of priest would be such a flirt?

273
00:24:57,583 --> 00:24:58,583
Who cares,

274
00:24:58,750 --> 00:25:00,210
as long as he can protect us.

275
00:25:00,375 --> 00:25:01,245
True.

276
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:37,173
Come up here.

277
00:25:38,083 --> 00:25:42,043
This was stolen from the bowels of hell.

278
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:44,578
Long time not make bread.

279
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:47,000
Long time not make bread? No bread?

280
00:25:47,416 --> 00:25:49,326
Not tonight, tonight we're having bread.

281
00:25:52,708 --> 00:25:55,288
These women quickly took over the cellar.

282
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:57,786
It was once a filthy, messy place,

283
00:25:58,208 --> 00:25:59,708
but within hours,

284
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,790
they had transformed it into the Qin Huai River.

285
00:26:02,208 --> 00:26:03,368
The fragrance of rouge and perfume

286
00:26:03,541 --> 00:26:05,251
danced up through the air.

287
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:28,250
I can smell the bread.

288
00:26:28,375 --> 00:26:29,415
We are coming up!

289
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,870
I couldn't stop them.

290
00:26:47,833 --> 00:26:48,543
Hello.

291
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:53,503
I remember

292
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:56,075
when I first saw these women,

293
00:26:56,541 --> 00:26:59,081
they were tramps,
parading around in their lingerie,

294
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:00,708
not the graceful ladies
that the legends of Qin Huai

295
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:01,745
had portrayed them to be.

296
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,746
Look, this should be good.

297
00:27:26,458 --> 00:27:27,288
George,

298
00:27:27,416 --> 00:27:28,496
you little shit,

299
00:27:28,916 --> 00:27:30,746
you said there was no wine here.

300
00:27:31,333 --> 00:27:32,083
Excuse me.

301
00:27:32,750 --> 00:27:33,830
What's he saying?

302
00:27:36,666 --> 00:27:38,206
Holy hooch!

303
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:40,958
How dare you drink the wine!

304
00:27:41,125 --> 00:27:42,325
Now the Westerner knows about the wine.

305
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:44,120
We sell the wine to raise money for orphans.

306
00:27:44,291 --> 00:27:45,291
We're all orphans.

307
00:27:45,458 --> 00:27:47,078
We also need help.

308
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:48,831
That's right.

309
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:50,115
What are they saying?

310
00:27:50,291 --> 00:27:51,541
They said they're orphans!

311
00:27:51,708 --> 00:27:52,418
Orphans?

312
00:27:52,791 --> 00:27:54,291
Well, I'd like to adopt all of you,

313
00:27:54,458 --> 00:27:55,118
right now.

314
00:27:55,416 --> 00:27:56,826
Adopt all of us?

315
00:27:57,333 --> 00:27:59,083
You would not be able to cope.

316
00:28:02,083 --> 00:28:03,873
You are not the only ones who speak English!

317
00:28:04,041 --> 00:28:04,671
That's right!

318
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:07,918
You speak English?

319
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,583
The Westerner is a playboy.

320
00:28:23,875 --> 00:28:25,415
Of course! Haven't you heard?

321
00:28:25,583 --> 00:28:28,713
Westerners with beards are the horniest!

322
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,293
No wonder she is
the top girl of the Qin Huai River.

323
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:32,868
Mo, use all of your skills.

324
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:34,751
Seduce him!

325
00:28:34,916 --> 00:28:36,246
That's right.

326
00:28:36,416 --> 00:28:39,326
Make the big nose go crazy for us!

327
00:28:47,250 --> 00:28:48,370
My name is John.

328
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,370
And you are?

329
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:53,748
Yu Mo.

330
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:55,248
I like that.

331
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:59,670
So what do you and your companions do?

332
00:29:00,791 --> 00:29:02,041
We are kindergarten teachers.

333
00:29:02,208 --> 00:29:04,168
Really? Kindergarten teachers.

334
00:29:04,375 --> 00:29:05,035
Shameless.

335
00:29:05,208 --> 00:29:05,828
And you?

336
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:06,920
What do you do?

337
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,253
I'm also a kindergarten teacher.

338
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:12,865
So as,

339
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:14,745
teacher to teacher,

340
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,750
you wanna...

341
00:29:16,708 --> 00:29:19,498
get together and have a cup of joe, or...

342
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,830
What're those two yapping about?

343
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,540
Tell me.

344
00:29:21,708 --> 00:29:24,458
Nothing. He's asking your price.

345
00:29:24,916 --> 00:29:25,916
I told him.

346
00:29:26,083 --> 00:29:27,793
He thinks you are too cheap.

347
00:30:09,750 --> 00:30:10,670
There's no coffee.

348
00:30:11,083 --> 00:30:12,293
Let's get liquored up.

349
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:24,580
Cheers.

350
00:30:27,833 --> 00:30:30,173
The kindergarten fee is enough?

351
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:42,580
You coming?

352
00:30:44,875 --> 00:30:46,865
I want you to take us out of Nanking.

353
00:30:54,416 --> 00:30:55,116
Yeah.

354
00:30:55,833 --> 00:30:56,373
Right.

355
00:30:56,833 --> 00:30:57,503
We do this first?

356
00:30:57,666 --> 00:30:58,826
I'm serious.

357
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,211
Why else you think we were flirting with you?

358
00:31:05,208 --> 00:31:06,668
Out of Nanking, how?

359
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:09,285
I don't know how,

360
00:31:09,791 --> 00:31:12,421
but I know your face is the way out of here.

361
00:31:12,833 --> 00:31:14,873
The Japanese won't touch Westerners.

362
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,538
Did you see it out there?

363
00:31:17,708 --> 00:31:18,828
That's not happening.

364
00:31:21,458 --> 00:31:21,958
No.

365
00:31:23,125 --> 00:31:23,955
Cash enough?

366
00:31:24,791 --> 00:31:26,331
Cause... let's...

367
00:31:38,041 --> 00:31:39,961
Are you kidding?

368
00:31:40,125 --> 00:31:41,075
Wait...

369
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:43,370
Let's work this out. Let's work it out.

370
00:31:44,541 --> 00:31:45,461
Think about it.

371
00:31:45,958 --> 00:31:47,118
If you help us,

372
00:31:47,666 --> 00:31:48,916
I will thank you in ways

373
00:31:52,458 --> 00:31:53,618
All of us will.

374
00:31:56,416 --> 00:31:57,746
Can I get an advance?

375
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,710
The Japanese have posted a notice,

376
00:32:24,916 --> 00:32:26,786
whoever harbors soldiers will be shot.

377
00:32:27,125 --> 00:32:28,575
I'll shoot you first.

378
00:32:28,875 --> 00:32:30,165
Little bastard.

379
00:32:30,458 --> 00:32:32,208
Open up. Carry that guy in.

380
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,670
Get up.

381
00:33:10,916 --> 00:33:11,786
Get some water.

382
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:21,166
Hurry up!

383
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:24,213
What a temper.

384
00:33:24,375 --> 00:33:25,785
He thinks he's so tough.

385
00:33:27,083 --> 00:33:28,253
He thinks he's a hero.

386
00:33:28,416 --> 00:33:30,116
Since he's fighting the Japanese,

387
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:32,501
protecting Nanking and women like us,

388
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:34,456
he feels he is entitled to have a temper.

389
00:33:34,666 --> 00:33:36,996
Women like us need to hide here.

390
00:33:37,291 --> 00:33:39,791
But if he hides here, he's a coward.

391
00:33:39,958 --> 00:33:40,498
True.

392
00:33:40,666 --> 00:33:41,996
Yeah, what a sissy!

393
00:33:45,875 --> 00:33:46,785
Got scissors?

394
00:33:54,166 --> 00:33:54,866
Thanks.

395
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:09,416
- You ruined my dress!
- Don't touch him!

396
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:12,368
Save your attitude for the Japs.

397
00:34:12,541 --> 00:34:13,711
They are searching for Chinese soldiers like you.

398
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:14,825
You are endangering us!

399
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,420
There are convent girls here, too.

400
00:34:16,583 --> 00:34:17,503
Understand?

401
00:34:24,583 --> 00:34:25,253
Towel.

402
00:34:38,416 --> 00:34:39,666
What a handsome face.

403
00:34:41,291 --> 00:34:42,791
Dou has good taste in men.

404
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:44,870
I mean he looks like my brother.

405
00:34:45,375 --> 00:34:46,955
Are you hot for him?

406
00:34:47,125 --> 00:34:49,285
No, he really looks like my brother.

407
00:34:49,458 --> 00:34:50,748
You have a crush on him.

408
00:34:50,916 --> 00:34:52,206
No, I don't.

409
00:34:52,375 --> 00:34:53,365
Dou, cool off.

410
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:55,081
He doesn't even have hair down there!

411
00:35:04,958 --> 00:35:06,538
He was homeless, so our troop took him in.

412
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:07,540
He's called Pu Sheng.

413
00:35:07,791 --> 00:35:08,751
He's just a child.

414
00:35:09,041 --> 00:35:10,291
Why are you leaving him with us?

415
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,330
Get some cloth,

416
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,790
tighten the bandage

417
00:35:13,958 --> 00:35:14,958
so he won't bleed too much.

418
00:35:15,791 --> 00:35:17,211
It's the best I can do.

419
00:35:18,416 --> 00:35:19,576
I want him to be in a warm place

420
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:21,370
before he dies.

421
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:24,616
Thank you.

422
00:37:05,875 --> 00:37:06,665
Please wait.

423
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:16,865
What do you want?

424
00:37:17,125 --> 00:37:18,575
We have sharp tongues,

425
00:37:19,125 --> 00:37:20,745
and we were very rude.

426
00:37:21,541 --> 00:37:23,331
I hope you can forgive us.

427
00:37:33,041 --> 00:37:35,121
Don't point a gun at a man of the cloth.

428
00:37:38,291 --> 00:37:39,041
Mo.

429
00:37:39,625 --> 00:37:41,915
Like me as a priest? Do you?

430
00:37:44,041 --> 00:37:45,371
I dressed up for you.

431
00:37:45,708 --> 00:37:47,038
I got a chance now?

432
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:53,003
Is he the priest?

433
00:37:55,208 --> 00:37:56,368
Does he belong to the church?

434
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:58,245
You can say that.

435
00:37:59,083 --> 00:38:01,213
What, the bank's closed for me, but he gets...

436
00:38:01,375 --> 00:38:03,995
He gets a special soldier discount or something?

437
00:38:06,833 --> 00:38:07,623
Please tell him,

438
00:38:08,333 --> 00:38:09,623
the students can't end up

439
00:38:09,791 --> 00:38:11,041
in the hands of the Japanese.

440
00:38:11,375 --> 00:38:12,825
Otherwise my men would have died

441
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:14,415
for nothing.

442
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:25,751
What's wrong with you?

443
00:38:26,250 --> 00:38:27,120
I want to help you.

444
00:38:27,291 --> 00:38:28,961
I've joined the priesthood.

445
00:38:29,125 --> 00:38:30,705
Stop it. It's not the right time.

446
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:31,995
You don't want cash.

447
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:33,246
You want me to save you.

448
00:38:33,416 --> 00:38:34,866
I'm gonna save your soul.

449
00:38:35,125 --> 00:38:37,035
I'll absolve you of your sins tonight.

450
00:38:37,291 --> 00:38:39,461
Blessed are thee among women.

451
00:38:39,958 --> 00:38:42,828
Blessed are thy lips, blessed are thy eyes,

452
00:38:43,291 --> 00:38:44,121
blessed are thy hips...

453
00:38:44,291 --> 00:38:44,871
Don't.

454
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:47,541
And thy gams, and thy chest...

455
00:38:47,708 --> 00:38:48,578
Stop it!

456
00:38:50,416 --> 00:38:51,286
- Stop it!
- I gotta...

457
00:38:51,458 --> 00:38:52,918
Stop it!

458
00:38:53,083 --> 00:38:54,963
You drunk bastard!

459
00:38:58,458 --> 00:38:59,788
This is a house of love not war,

460
00:38:59,958 --> 00:39:00,958
you get out of here.

461
00:39:01,291 --> 00:39:02,291
Who's he really?

462
00:39:02,875 --> 00:39:04,575
An idiot. Don't mind him.

463
00:39:05,791 --> 00:39:06,751
Fine, I'll leave now.

464
00:39:18,625 --> 00:39:19,285
See,

465
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:22,291
I'm the only man for you.

466
00:39:23,041 --> 00:39:24,251
You're such a fool!

467
00:39:24,458 --> 00:39:26,498
If it wasn't for your foreign face...

468
00:39:26,666 --> 00:39:27,746
I like it when you're angry.

469
00:39:27,916 --> 00:39:28,786
I wouldn't even look at you!

470
00:39:28,958 --> 00:39:29,618
Harder.

471
00:39:29,958 --> 00:39:31,618
I'll never be into you.

472
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:32,620
Come here.

473
00:39:32,791 --> 00:39:33,461
Get off me!

474
00:39:35,166 --> 00:39:36,116
I love that!

475
00:39:37,125 --> 00:39:38,825
I love seeing you walk away.

476
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,120
I love seeing that ass.

477
00:39:42,083 --> 00:39:45,173
Mo!

478
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:47,670
That night,

479
00:39:47,916 --> 00:39:49,246
Major Li didn't go far.

480
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,330
He stayed at the paper shop across the street.

481
00:39:51,958 --> 00:39:52,668
I know,

482
00:39:52,875 --> 00:39:54,825
he could have changed into
civilian clothing and fled.

483
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,250
I said you can't go in!

484
00:40:10,625 --> 00:40:11,785
Little sister,

485
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:14,168
we won't shit or piss in there.

486
00:40:14,416 --> 00:40:16,326
We just want to wash up.

487
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,250
We always wash before bed-time.

488
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:20,706
Bed-time?

489
00:40:21,166 --> 00:40:24,826
Morning for you is night for us.

490
00:40:25,541 --> 00:40:25,961
Little sister...

491
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:26,995
Don't call me sister!

492
00:40:27,166 --> 00:40:28,496
You want to start a fight?

493
00:40:28,666 --> 00:40:29,496
The bathroom is for people.

494
00:40:29,666 --> 00:40:30,866
You mean we are not people?

495
00:40:31,041 --> 00:40:32,371
You know what you are!

496
00:40:32,541 --> 00:40:33,621
You've got some nerve!

497
00:40:33,791 --> 00:40:35,581
We won't share the bathroom with you!

498
00:40:36,916 --> 00:40:38,326
What a temper!

499
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,290
Sorry, go back to your rat hole.

500
00:40:41,416 --> 00:40:42,416
What the hell?

501
00:40:42,583 --> 00:40:43,543
She's humiliating us.

502
00:40:43,708 --> 00:40:45,208
She thinks we are filthy.

503
00:40:45,375 --> 00:40:46,205
Little bitch!

504
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,460
You're the bitch!

505
00:40:47,625 --> 00:40:49,325
Watch your mouth!

506
00:40:49,500 --> 00:40:51,540
Ling, want to see a good fight?

507
00:40:51,708 --> 00:40:52,498
Really?

508
00:40:52,708 --> 00:40:54,868
I thought you'd only fight for Mo.

509
00:40:55,708 --> 00:40:56,868
Let's pull down your pants

510
00:40:57,041 --> 00:40:58,751
and see what you are made of.

511
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:01,415
Don't touch me, you filthy whore!

512
00:41:01,583 --> 00:41:04,253
Let's find out if you really are cleaner than us.

513
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,170
Stop it! It's not fair!

514
00:41:07,333 --> 00:41:08,123
I don't have to hit you,

515
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:09,711
I can just crush you with my butt!

516
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:12,253
I don't give a damn, I'm going in.

517
00:41:12,625 --> 00:41:13,915
I won't let you go in!

518
00:41:16,833 --> 00:41:17,923
Stop fighting!

519
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:18,960
What's going on?

520
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:20,115
Stop!

521
00:41:22,333 --> 00:41:23,123
What are you doing?

522
00:41:23,250 --> 00:41:24,170
Are you crazy?

523
00:41:24,791 --> 00:41:25,871
We are just kids!

524
00:41:26,041 --> 00:41:26,751
Hua, that's enough.

525
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:27,916
No, it's not over!

526
00:41:28,083 --> 00:41:29,923
I won't let you go in!

527
00:41:37,791 --> 00:41:38,581
Japanese!

528
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,790
Go to the cellar, I'll tell the others!

529
00:41:56,708 --> 00:41:57,828
Search the yard!

530
00:42:09,666 --> 00:42:11,076
Split up!

531
00:42:20,083 --> 00:42:21,173
Hurry! Go to the cellar!

532
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:02,705
Come in, hurry!

533
00:43:08,208 --> 00:43:10,038
Don't shut it, let the girls in.

534
00:43:10,208 --> 00:43:11,418
Let the girls in!

535
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:15,038
Hurry!

536
00:43:19,166 --> 00:43:19,996
Don't move!

537
00:43:26,416 --> 00:43:27,416
Lieutenant Asakura!

538
00:43:27,583 --> 00:43:28,753
Come over here!

539
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:30,210
Upstairs!

540
00:44:23,583 --> 00:44:24,423
Hurry!

541
00:44:24,958 --> 00:44:26,118
Let's move the shelves!

542
00:44:30,625 --> 00:44:31,615
There are girls here!

543
00:44:31,958 --> 00:44:32,828
Search everywhere!

544
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:34,455
Capture them alive!

545
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,540
Lieutenant Asakura!

546
00:46:02,083 --> 00:46:03,213
Come up here!

547
00:46:03,583 --> 00:46:04,873
We've got virgins!

548
00:46:05,416 --> 00:46:06,616
Hurry!

549
00:46:07,541 --> 00:46:08,371
Stop!

550
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:10,620
Girls! Girls!

551
00:47:02,458 --> 00:47:07,418
Stop!

552
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:10,208
This is a house of the Lord!

553
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:12,120
These are children!

554
00:47:12,583 --> 00:47:15,873
You are breaking the laws of man and of God!

555
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,120
No soldiers here!

556
00:47:18,291 --> 00:47:20,331
You have no business being here!

557
00:47:21,250 --> 00:47:22,290
I am the priest!

558
00:47:22,666 --> 00:47:23,866
And I command you,

559
00:47:24,125 --> 00:47:26,865
in the name of the Father to leave now!

560
00:47:27,291 --> 00:47:28,961
Girls, you come up here now!

561
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:30,615
Come up these stairs,

562
00:47:30,833 --> 00:47:31,753
and stand behind me.

563
00:47:33,833 --> 00:47:34,963
You're honorable men,

564
00:47:35,125 --> 00:47:36,285
behave honorably!

565
00:48:11,625 --> 00:48:15,165
I'll eat you up.

566
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:40,540
Stop! Stop this! Stop! Run!

567
00:48:40,875 --> 00:48:42,535
Stop this! Don't...

568
00:50:14,125 --> 00:50:15,205
Chinese soldiers!

569
00:50:15,666 --> 00:50:17,326
Get them!

570
00:50:18,875 --> 00:50:19,785
Let's go!

571
00:50:27,208 --> 00:50:29,288
Assemble outside! Roll call!

572
00:50:29,458 --> 00:50:30,668
Prepare for combat!

573
00:51:15,375 --> 00:51:16,995
The sniper is across the street!

574
00:51:17,708 --> 00:51:18,828
To your left!

575
00:51:58,291 --> 00:52:00,461
It's a trap! Find the enemy!

576
00:52:31,875 --> 00:52:32,415
Damn it!

577
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:34,213
He's in the building there!

578
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:42,791
Use the grenades!

579
00:53:07,625 --> 00:53:09,285
Behind us! Fire!

580
00:53:10,458 --> 00:53:11,868
Keep firing!

581
00:53:59,875 --> 00:54:00,955
Hold your fire!

582
00:54:47,583 --> 00:54:48,253
Wait!

583
00:55:12,958 --> 00:55:13,578
Fire!

584
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:00,580
First platoon to the back gate!

585
00:56:01,166 --> 00:56:02,996
Second platoon to the front gate!

586
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:10,790
Colonel,

587
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:13,250
he used to work for the traffic department.

588
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:15,250
Most roads in Nanking are destroyed.

589
00:56:15,416 --> 00:56:16,786
Having him can be useful.

590
00:56:17,666 --> 00:56:18,666
Speak Japanese?

591
00:56:18,833 --> 00:56:19,423
Yes.

592
00:56:49,291 --> 00:56:51,291
Were our soldiers here recently?

593
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:54,668
Are you the resident priest?

594
00:56:57,125 --> 00:56:57,665
Yes.

595
00:56:57,833 --> 00:56:58,373
Father,

596
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:01,210
I apologize on behalf of our soldiers.

597
00:57:01,708 --> 00:57:02,788
Please understand.

598
00:57:03,083 --> 00:57:04,373
In the middle of a war,

599
00:57:04,708 --> 00:57:07,538
occasional unfortunate behavior is inevitable.

600
00:57:10,083 --> 00:57:10,873
Your church

601
00:57:11,041 --> 00:57:12,421
is very beautiful.

602
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:15,290
How do you do?

603
00:57:16,708 --> 00:57:18,418
Are you students here at the convent?

604
00:57:19,083 --> 00:57:20,503
So sorry to have caused you alarm.

605
00:57:20,666 --> 00:57:21,206
Please...

606
00:57:22,416 --> 00:57:24,076
don't hurt the children anymore.

607
00:57:24,458 --> 00:57:25,168
Naturally.

608
00:57:25,541 --> 00:57:26,871
My name is Hasegawa.

609
00:57:27,291 --> 00:57:29,831
I am responsible for the safety of this area.

610
00:57:30,208 --> 00:57:31,368
Please do not worry...

611
00:57:32,083 --> 00:57:33,713
about the security of the church

612
00:57:33,875 --> 00:57:34,705
and the students.

613
00:57:36,375 --> 00:57:37,535
I apologize...

614
00:57:38,208 --> 00:57:42,418
but I have no confidence... in that assurance.

615
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:44,461
My guarantee is effective.

616
00:57:44,958 --> 00:57:45,868
From now on,

617
00:57:46,583 --> 00:57:48,753
I shall post armed guards in front of the church

618
00:57:48,916 --> 00:57:50,206
to protect you all.

619
00:57:58,916 --> 00:58:00,416
There is not a lot of food

620
00:58:00,583 --> 00:58:02,043
in Nanking at the moment.

621
00:58:02,708 --> 00:58:05,118
I hope the students will not go hungry.

622
00:58:14,791 --> 00:58:15,421
May I?

623
00:59:13,250 --> 00:59:13,790
Thank you.

624
00:59:15,666 --> 00:59:16,536
Did you like it?

625
00:59:19,125 --> 00:59:21,205
This is a Japanese folk song,

626
00:59:21,666 --> 00:59:22,456
"My Home."

627
00:59:23,333 --> 00:59:24,793
It is about hills and rabbits,

628
00:59:24,958 --> 00:59:26,618
and streams full of fish.

629
00:59:27,208 --> 00:59:29,498
It is the most beautiful song in the world

630
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:31,166
for those who are homesick.

631
00:59:39,666 --> 00:59:41,286
Do the students sing well?

632
00:59:45,208 --> 00:59:46,868
Very well, yes.

633
00:59:47,333 --> 00:59:48,123
That's good.

634
00:59:48,583 --> 00:59:49,333
I shall come back

635
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,080
in a couple of days to hear them.

636
00:59:52,916 --> 00:59:53,536
Why?

637
00:59:53,958 --> 00:59:54,828
No reason.

638
00:59:56,250 --> 00:59:57,870
I happen to love music.

639
00:59:58,416 --> 01:00:00,706
Father, we shall meet again soon.

640
01:00:42,083 --> 01:00:45,923
I hope you will not be lonely buried together.

641
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:12,075
Father John.

642
01:01:14,125 --> 01:01:16,785
You won't leave us, will you?

643
01:01:32,291 --> 01:01:34,041
We shouldn't have taken over your cellar.

644
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:35,250
Sorry.

645
01:01:39,291 --> 01:01:40,961
If we hadn't fought with that girl,

646
01:01:41,125 --> 01:01:42,325
she would still be alive.

647
01:01:42,708 --> 01:01:43,918
This is all our fault.

648
01:01:53,625 --> 01:01:54,415
Thank you.

649
01:02:06,208 --> 01:02:08,208
Why not answer Shu?

650
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,420
She called me Father John.

651
01:02:15,333 --> 01:02:16,503
We all need you.

652
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:17,786
I'm a mortician.

653
01:02:18,708 --> 01:02:19,708
You are priest.

654
01:02:19,875 --> 01:02:20,705
No.

655
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,170
- If we have a priest...
- George.

656
01:02:23,333 --> 01:02:25,503
Maybe Japanese...

657
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:27,081
not dare...

658
01:02:27,833 --> 01:02:28,583
You are priest!

659
01:02:28,750 --> 01:02:30,120
George, I'm not.

660
01:02:31,833 --> 01:02:33,003
I'm not a priest.

661
01:02:33,166 --> 01:02:33,616
I'm not!

662
01:02:33,791 --> 01:02:35,081
I stayed here,

663
01:02:35,416 --> 01:02:38,116
because I was looking for your cash.

664
01:02:39,208 --> 01:02:41,078
And because that's the nicest bed that

665
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:42,710
I've slept in in years. I didn't get there.

666
01:02:42,875 --> 01:02:45,115
But is that like a priest? I'm not a priest!

667
01:02:45,875 --> 01:02:46,455
I'm not.

668
01:02:46,625 --> 01:02:49,615
I took catechism lessons as a kid.

669
01:02:49,791 --> 01:02:52,461
Sometimes I remember that when I'm drunk,

670
01:02:52,625 --> 01:02:54,495
which I am as often as I can be.

671
01:03:02,875 --> 01:03:04,665
You not be priest.

672
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:08,040
Tell girls yourself.

673
01:03:28,125 --> 01:03:29,615
You little shit!

674
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:32,998
You are.

675
01:03:50,916 --> 01:03:52,826
We've heard about what happen today.

676
01:03:53,375 --> 01:03:54,455
So you're staying?

677
01:04:02,875 --> 01:04:03,495
Yeah.

678
01:04:05,083 --> 01:04:05,713
Even though you were

679
01:04:05,875 --> 01:04:07,495
a drunk bastard last night,

680
01:04:07,625 --> 01:04:09,575
what you did today makes you a hero.

681
01:04:15,291 --> 01:04:17,081
I'm sorry about last night.

682
01:04:19,875 --> 01:04:20,495
Yeah.

683
01:04:22,875 --> 01:04:24,575
I can't leave them by themselves.

684
01:04:25,625 --> 01:04:26,285
And that little shit

685
01:04:26,458 --> 01:04:28,828
has a way of just... you know.

686
01:04:31,416 --> 01:04:33,496
What do you think the Japanese are up to?

687
01:04:34,125 --> 01:04:36,415
Are they really here to protect the students?

688
01:04:42,833 --> 01:04:44,083
We were counting on having you

689
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:45,540
help us leave Nanking.

690
01:04:45,708 --> 01:04:47,328
But I guess now you'll have to

691
01:04:47,541 --> 01:04:49,421
stay here and be a priest.

692
01:04:51,041 --> 01:04:52,791
Yeah, right.

693
01:04:54,791 --> 01:04:55,461
Priest.

694
01:04:59,125 --> 01:05:00,535
Actually, I came to tell you,

695
01:05:00,666 --> 01:05:02,166
our offer is still good.

696
01:05:02,333 --> 01:05:04,253
We still want you to help us escape.

697
01:05:04,458 --> 01:05:06,668
As soon as the Japanese guards are gone.

698
01:05:08,166 --> 01:05:10,076
Just now the ladies were having a bet.

699
01:05:10,708 --> 01:05:13,168
They said that hero or no hero,

700
01:05:13,375 --> 01:05:14,365
you don't stand a chance

701
01:05:14,541 --> 01:05:16,921
when you're up against a beauty like me.

702
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:19,120
Don't flatter yourself.

703
01:05:20,583 --> 01:05:21,333
We'll see.

704
01:05:50,916 --> 01:05:51,866
Did you like it?

705
01:05:55,208 --> 01:05:56,208
I only have one string.

706
01:05:56,375 --> 01:05:58,245
It sound like a beggar's plea. Even worse.

707
01:06:08,166 --> 01:06:09,206
You're Pu Sheng.

708
01:06:09,375 --> 01:06:10,245
Born in the Pu region?

709
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:12,833
My family is also from there.

710
01:06:14,083 --> 01:06:14,923
When you're healthy,

711
01:06:15,208 --> 01:06:16,618
I'll take you to the biggest dance hall,

712
01:06:16,791 --> 01:06:18,121
to see the prettiest girls.

713
01:06:19,791 --> 01:06:20,541
Thank you.

714
01:06:22,208 --> 01:06:22,958
Little hometown fellow,

715
01:06:23,125 --> 01:06:23,915
don't thank me,

716
01:06:24,083 --> 01:06:24,873
marry me.

717
01:06:29,125 --> 01:06:30,665
I'll work in the fields with you.

718
01:06:32,666 --> 01:06:33,666
I don't have...

719
01:06:34,583 --> 01:06:35,423
fields.

720
01:06:36,208 --> 01:06:37,168
What do you have then?

721
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:41,080
I don't have anything.

722
01:06:41,541 --> 01:06:43,921
Then I'll play my pipa everyday.

723
01:06:44,375 --> 01:06:46,115
When I play, you hold out a bowl.

724
01:06:46,333 --> 01:06:47,793
We'll beg for food and feed your mom.

725
01:06:49,291 --> 01:06:50,961
I don't have a mother.

726
01:06:51,458 --> 01:06:53,458
Everyone in my family is dead.

727
01:07:57,166 --> 01:07:58,996
If you had just come with me,

728
01:07:59,583 --> 01:08:01,213
this wouldn't have happened.

729
01:08:01,541 --> 01:08:03,461
You were so stubborn,

730
01:08:03,708 --> 01:08:04,958
and wouldn't leave without your classmates.

731
01:08:05,166 --> 01:08:06,166
How could I have gotten

732
01:08:06,333 --> 01:08:07,503
that many boat tickets?

733
01:08:08,541 --> 01:08:09,251
Because of you,

734
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:11,540
I'm staying in Nanking.

735
01:08:17,250 --> 01:08:17,920
Tell me,

736
01:08:18,083 --> 01:08:19,543
what's this?

737
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,210
Explain to me,

738
01:08:21,458 --> 01:08:23,038
why do you do this?

739
01:08:26,916 --> 01:08:28,036
If I don't do this,

740
01:08:28,416 --> 01:08:29,496
I can't survive.

741
01:08:30,166 --> 01:08:31,866
I'm doing this for you.

742
01:08:32,166 --> 01:08:32,916
You must believe me,

743
01:08:33,083 --> 01:08:34,753
I would never do anything bad.

744
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:36,118
Daughter,

745
01:08:37,041 --> 01:08:38,331
I will find a way

746
01:08:38,916 --> 01:08:40,036
to get you out of Nanking.

747
01:08:51,291 --> 01:08:52,671
No wonder there were no boat tickets.

748
01:08:52,916 --> 01:08:53,746
Traitor!

749
01:09:27,791 --> 01:09:29,121
You work for the Japanese?

750
01:09:29,291 --> 01:09:30,791
Since I cannot save my country,

751
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:31,998
cannot save others,

752
01:09:32,166 --> 01:09:33,786
I can only try to save myself.

753
01:09:34,291 --> 01:09:36,461
I'm already doing my best, you know.

754
01:09:36,666 --> 01:09:37,826
Do you think it's easy

755
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:39,120
working for the Japanese?

756
01:09:39,291 --> 01:09:40,501
It's good you work for the Japanese,

757
01:09:40,666 --> 01:09:41,416
that helps us.

758
01:09:41,583 --> 01:09:43,213
What is your plan for your daughter?

759
01:09:43,791 --> 01:09:44,871
I would like to try,

760
01:09:45,041 --> 01:09:46,871
and use my connections with the Japanese

761
01:09:47,041 --> 01:09:48,961
to get my daughter out of the city.

762
01:09:50,291 --> 01:09:51,291
Not to the refuge?

763
01:09:51,458 --> 01:09:52,248
The refuge?

764
01:09:52,416 --> 01:09:54,116
It's not safe there at all!

765
01:09:57,041 --> 01:09:58,961
What's your plan for the rest of the girls?

766
01:10:03,583 --> 01:10:04,293
Mr. Meng?

767
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:07,120
I have this truck.

768
01:10:07,291 --> 01:10:09,711
If I can get the right tools,

769
01:10:09,958 --> 01:10:11,708
then maybe I can get it started.

770
01:10:11,875 --> 01:10:12,915
Can you help me?

771
01:10:15,541 --> 01:10:16,671
I have a list here.

772
01:10:17,208 --> 01:10:17,918
Mr. Meng.

773
01:10:18,208 --> 01:10:19,578
I need these tools.

774
01:10:20,166 --> 01:10:21,166
Can you help me get them?

775
01:10:22,125 --> 01:10:23,865
You're the only one who can get them for me.

776
01:10:25,083 --> 01:10:31,333
I need these tools.

777
01:10:31,500 --> 01:10:34,370
Take this.

778
01:10:39,958 --> 01:10:40,998
If I fix the truck...

779
01:10:42,166 --> 01:10:44,166
If I fix the truck, what then?

780
01:10:44,333 --> 01:10:45,213
How would I know?

781
01:10:48,041 --> 01:10:48,671
Wait, wait.

782
01:10:48,875 --> 01:10:50,245
If I fix the truck,

783
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:51,870
what would I need then?

784
01:10:52,041 --> 01:10:53,461
Of course you'll need a permit.

785
01:10:53,625 --> 01:10:54,535
I need a permit?

786
01:10:56,708 --> 01:10:57,578
I need a permit.

787
01:10:58,916 --> 01:10:59,866
Don't look at me.

788
01:11:00,750 --> 01:11:01,960
It's too risky!

789
01:11:25,875 --> 01:11:27,365
Even if you fix the truck,

790
01:11:27,916 --> 01:11:29,956
how would you get past the Japanese guards?

791
01:11:30,833 --> 01:11:31,673
I don't know.

792
01:11:34,625 --> 01:11:36,075
I don't know how long

793
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:38,250
the guards will stay here.

794
01:11:39,541 --> 01:11:42,001
But I want to get that truck started

795
01:11:42,166 --> 01:11:43,366
for when they leave.

796
01:11:43,583 --> 01:11:46,543
It seems that you know more than just drinking.

797
01:11:56,125 --> 01:11:57,955
I don't think she likes seeing us together.

798
01:11:58,125 --> 01:11:59,325
She has a crush on you.

799
01:11:59,500 --> 01:12:00,120
Really?

800
01:12:03,958 --> 01:12:05,368
You know, I was like her.

801
01:12:07,166 --> 01:12:07,746
Yeah?

802
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,290
I was at a convent for six years.

803
01:12:17,083 --> 01:12:19,753
That's where you learned your English?

804
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:26,865
What happened?

805
01:12:28,458 --> 01:12:31,118
Just another story of misfortune.

806
01:12:31,291 --> 01:12:34,001
It wouldn't interest a passerby like yourself.

807
01:12:34,875 --> 01:12:35,615
Yeah, it would.

808
01:12:36,625 --> 01:12:42,365
Tell me.

809
01:12:46,333 --> 01:12:48,793
I was never meant to be like this.

810
01:12:52,541 --> 01:12:53,461
Never mind.

811
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:56,333
You know what?

812
01:12:57,166 --> 01:12:59,666
I was the best in my English class,

813
01:13:00,333 --> 01:13:02,213
but everyone used to mock me.

814
01:13:02,666 --> 01:13:04,786
They said I put on airs and graces

815
01:13:05,333 --> 01:13:09,043
and acted like I was the Queen of England.

816
01:13:11,666 --> 01:13:13,916
Well, that's not
what you were going to tell me, but...

817
01:13:15,083 --> 01:13:16,673
So... the Queen of England.

818
01:13:17,083 --> 01:13:18,173
You mean you're not?

819
01:13:18,750 --> 01:13:20,370
I thought... yeah.

820
01:13:22,583 --> 01:13:25,253
Like Shu, I too had a crush on someone.

821
01:13:25,958 --> 01:13:28,828
But he was a young, fresh-faced guy,

822
01:13:30,333 --> 01:13:32,543
got the most beautiful eyes,

823
01:13:34,666 --> 01:13:36,666
not a dirty, bearded man like you.

824
01:13:41,791 --> 01:13:42,711
OK.

825
01:14:37,458 --> 01:14:38,288
It's rotten.

826
01:14:41,333 --> 01:14:44,543
Sister.

827
01:14:45,750 --> 01:14:46,540
What are you saying?

828
01:14:47,500 --> 01:14:48,080
Sister...

829
01:14:48,875 --> 01:14:49,575
Hurry...

830
01:14:51,458 --> 01:14:52,248
Pu Sheng,

831
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:53,580
I'm here.

832
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:56,165
Thunder...

833
01:14:57,208 --> 01:14:58,288
What are you trying to say?

834
01:15:00,166 --> 01:15:02,246
Rain...

835
01:15:05,875 --> 01:15:06,915
What rain?

836
01:15:07,791 --> 01:15:09,621
It's death weeping for you.

837
01:15:11,166 --> 01:15:15,326
The wheat is drying outside...

838
01:15:17,041 --> 01:15:20,291
Don't let it get soaked.

839
01:16:16,333 --> 01:16:18,123
That was the soldier that the officer brought.

840
01:16:18,541 --> 01:16:19,871
I heard he was about our age.

841
01:16:20,583 --> 01:16:21,713
Which officer?

842
01:16:22,000 --> 01:16:23,670
The officer who saved us that day.

843
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:27,500
He hid the soldier inside the cellar,

844
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,540
and the women were taking care of him.

845
01:16:30,416 --> 01:16:32,826
Actually those women from the brothel...

846
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:34,580
are not that bad.

847
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:37,211
Where's Dou?

848
01:16:40,333 --> 01:16:41,543
Lan's missing too.

849
01:16:41,875 --> 01:16:42,665
Really?

850
01:16:43,416 --> 01:16:45,116
Haven't seen them for a while.

851
01:16:45,750 --> 01:16:46,870
Are they still in the cellar?

852
01:16:47,541 --> 01:16:48,791
Have you seen Dou?

853
01:16:55,791 --> 01:16:58,211
Dou and Lan got out.

854
01:16:58,833 --> 01:16:59,543
How?

855
01:16:59,708 --> 01:17:00,618
Where did they go?

856
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:03,326
Dou insisted on getting pipa strings.

857
01:17:03,791 --> 01:17:05,671
She wanted to play the pipa for Pu Sheng.

858
01:17:06,125 --> 01:17:07,365
She said he had a hard life,

859
01:17:07,625 --> 01:17:08,865
and he was like her brother.

860
01:17:09,416 --> 01:17:11,826
She wanted to play something nice for him,

861
01:17:12,125 --> 01:17:13,535
but one string wasn't enough,

862
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:15,460
she needed three more.

863
01:17:15,708 --> 01:17:16,418
What about Lan?

864
01:17:16,750 --> 01:17:17,580
Why did she go?

865
01:17:17,916 --> 01:17:20,616
She said she left her earrings behind.

866
01:17:21,250 --> 01:17:22,250
How could they leave?

867
01:17:22,750 --> 01:17:24,040
The Japanese are guarding the gates.

868
01:17:24,250 --> 01:17:26,500
I don't know how they got out.

869
01:17:26,750 --> 01:17:28,710
They disappeared when it was dark.

870
01:17:29,208 --> 01:17:29,958
Dou said that

871
01:17:30,666 --> 01:17:31,416
if she didn't go soon

872
01:17:31,583 --> 01:17:33,083
it would be too late for him.

873
01:17:33,291 --> 01:17:34,621
Why didn't you stop them!

874
01:17:34,791 --> 01:17:36,671
I tried, but it didn't work!

875
01:17:43,250 --> 01:17:44,040
What happened?

876
01:17:44,333 --> 01:17:46,543
Dou and Lan snuck out on their own.

877
01:17:47,291 --> 01:17:48,421
Dou and Lan?

878
01:17:49,708 --> 01:17:51,118
How? How did they leave?

879
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:52,253
I don't know.

880
01:17:52,708 --> 01:17:53,458
You know when?

881
01:17:53,625 --> 01:17:54,285
No.

882
01:17:55,333 --> 01:17:56,123
Where did they go?

883
01:17:56,416 --> 01:17:59,076
They went back to our brothel to get pipa strings.

884
01:18:10,125 --> 01:18:12,115
You want me to... go find them?

885
01:18:12,291 --> 01:18:12,791
Yeah.

886
01:18:14,958 --> 01:18:16,118
Mo, I'm not sure...

887
01:18:16,333 --> 01:18:17,173
Please.

888
01:18:19,416 --> 01:18:21,206
Please. Please!

889
01:18:30,375 --> 01:18:31,325
Alright, it's safer for me

890
01:18:31,458 --> 01:18:33,038
than anyone else, so I'll try.

891
01:18:33,833 --> 01:18:34,463
I'll try.

892
01:18:35,166 --> 01:18:37,666
If I can leave. If they let me leave.

893
01:18:39,625 --> 01:18:41,415
Candles, food.

894
01:18:41,875 --> 01:18:43,115
There is no food.

895
01:18:43,833 --> 01:18:44,713
They need food.

896
01:18:45,333 --> 01:18:46,253
With no food.

897
01:18:46,916 --> 01:18:47,706
No singing.

898
01:18:48,291 --> 01:18:51,171
Hasegawa asks girls to sing.

899
01:18:52,458 --> 01:18:54,248
Sing for the girls.

900
01:18:54,666 --> 01:18:56,416
Hasegawa asks.

901
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:00,620
But no singing with no food.

902
01:19:01,708 --> 01:19:03,208
And candles for Hasegawa.

903
01:19:03,750 --> 01:19:04,580
I go get food.

904
01:19:04,750 --> 01:19:06,830
Girl sing. Hasegawa happy. Yes?

905
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:07,750
I go now.

906
01:19:07,916 --> 01:19:09,866
George, you're not coming.

907
01:19:10,833 --> 01:19:12,503
I go, for food?

908
01:19:12,833 --> 01:19:13,423
Yes?

909
01:19:13,583 --> 01:19:14,583
George, you're not coming.

910
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:16,080
Go back inside!

911
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:16,960
Yes?

912
01:19:17,333 --> 01:19:18,503
Make Hasegawa happy.

913
01:19:19,500 --> 01:19:20,040
Go!

914
01:19:20,208 --> 01:19:21,708
This is fine, I go. Thank you.

915
01:19:25,791 --> 01:19:27,711
Officer, is he allowed to leave?

916
01:19:27,875 --> 01:19:30,035
We've been told not to let the girls leave.

917
01:19:30,291 --> 01:19:31,251
But he's the priest.

918
01:19:59,250 --> 01:19:59,960
Terry?

919
01:20:02,916 --> 01:20:03,536
Terry.

920
01:20:03,958 --> 01:20:04,708
John?

921
01:20:06,083 --> 01:20:06,873
I tried getting back,

922
01:20:07,041 --> 01:20:07,961
I tried getting back to the refuge.

923
01:20:08,125 --> 01:20:08,745
I got stuck.

924
01:20:09,250 --> 01:20:10,170
I couldn't get back.

925
01:20:10,333 --> 01:20:11,583
I was trying to get back. I'm sorry.

926
01:20:11,750 --> 01:20:13,920
I thought you were... I figured you were dead.

927
01:20:14,083 --> 01:20:14,963
I'm looking for two women,

928
01:20:15,125 --> 01:20:16,115
they got shiny dresses.

929
01:20:16,291 --> 01:20:18,251
I need to find them. They are in trouble.

930
01:20:18,416 --> 01:20:19,916
Why are you dressed like this? What is this?

931
01:20:20,083 --> 01:20:21,923
I got drunk, I woke up, I was just...

932
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:23,503
dressed as a priest.

933
01:20:25,583 --> 01:20:26,333
Who is this?

934
01:20:26,583 --> 01:20:27,753
This is George. This is George.

935
01:20:27,916 --> 01:20:28,666
Have you seen them?

936
01:20:28,833 --> 01:20:29,333
Seen who?

937
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:30,250
The women!

938
01:20:30,583 --> 01:20:32,583
There're women piled up all over the street.

939
01:20:32,750 --> 01:20:33,750
You haven't seen them?

940
01:20:33,916 --> 01:20:35,456
No, I haven't seen any women. No.

941
01:20:35,625 --> 01:20:37,495
You think it's safe to be
looking at the women right now?

942
01:20:37,666 --> 01:20:38,786
Can you help me with tools?

943
01:20:38,958 --> 01:20:39,748
Tools for what?

944
01:20:39,916 --> 01:20:40,916
I gotta fix a truck.

945
01:20:41,083 --> 01:20:42,003
Fix a truck for what?

946
01:20:42,166 --> 01:20:42,996
I gotta help George,

947
01:20:43,166 --> 01:20:44,116
I gotta help some girls,

948
01:20:44,291 --> 01:20:46,211
I gotta help some women, they're prostitutes,

949
01:20:46,375 --> 01:20:46,955
and I gotta help them.

950
01:20:47,125 --> 01:20:47,955
What? Are you kidding me?

951
01:20:48,125 --> 01:20:49,575
You're talking about prostitutes and trucks,

952
01:20:49,750 --> 01:20:50,460
and tools.

953
01:20:50,625 --> 01:20:52,365
I'm talking about not dying in China.

954
01:20:52,541 --> 01:20:53,751
I'm leaving right now.

955
01:20:54,125 --> 01:20:55,285
You're leaving Nanking right now?

956
01:20:55,458 --> 01:20:56,328
Do you wanna go?

957
01:20:57,000 --> 01:20:58,960
There's a boat. It's waiting for us.

958
01:20:59,333 --> 01:21:00,673
I'm leaving right now!

959
01:21:00,833 --> 01:21:02,373
If you wanna go, then let's go!

960
01:21:03,583 --> 01:21:04,673
It's your last chance.

961
01:21:09,958 --> 01:21:10,668
I gotta find them.

962
01:21:10,833 --> 01:21:11,543
I can't leave.

963
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:13,170
Are you kidding me right now?

964
01:21:13,583 --> 01:21:14,503
I'll see you, Terry!

965
01:21:15,625 --> 01:21:16,495
I'll see ya.

966
01:22:18,208 --> 01:22:18,958
Take off your coat!

967
01:22:20,416 --> 01:22:20,916
Hurry!

968
01:22:24,875 --> 01:22:26,035
They went that way.

969
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:30,040
Those are their coats.

970
01:22:31,916 --> 01:22:34,746
Look! Those are young girls' coats!

971
01:22:35,041 --> 01:22:36,041
The girls can't be far.

972
01:22:45,916 --> 01:22:47,746
Oh no, I dropped the strings!

973
01:22:49,333 --> 01:22:49,833
Forget it.

974
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:51,420
No, I have to find them.

975
01:23:42,125 --> 01:23:42,955
Over there!

976
01:23:43,125 --> 01:23:44,415
Don't shoot!

977
01:23:46,166 --> 01:23:48,286
Lan!

978
01:23:48,625 --> 01:23:50,115
Don't run!

979
01:23:57,583 --> 01:23:58,333
Bitch!

980
01:23:58,958 --> 01:23:59,998
Go to hell!

981
01:24:00,291 --> 01:24:01,121
We'll deal with her later.

982
01:24:01,291 --> 01:24:02,331
Let's catch the other one.

983
01:24:02,583 --> 01:24:03,293
Let's go!

984
01:24:14,833 --> 01:24:16,003
Here she is!

985
01:24:33,625 --> 01:24:35,495
Why am I always the last one?

986
01:24:35,708 --> 01:24:37,038
You shouldn't have shot the other girl.

987
01:24:37,208 --> 01:24:37,998
It's not fair!

988
01:24:38,166 --> 01:24:39,166
Hurry!

989
01:24:47,708 --> 01:24:49,118
Fuck you!

990
01:24:49,375 --> 01:24:50,955
Fuck you all!

991
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:59,370
Bitch! You bit me!

992
01:24:59,958 --> 01:25:02,208
I'll kill you!

993
01:25:04,583 --> 01:25:05,793
What an idiot! You got bitten!

994
01:25:05,958 --> 01:25:07,748
You can only handle the dead one upstairs!

995
01:26:13,750 --> 01:26:15,580
Is it? George, yes?

996
01:26:16,416 --> 01:26:20,286
Is it?

997
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:21,540
Yes?

998
01:26:33,250 --> 01:26:35,540
Stay there, stay there.

999
01:27:07,333 --> 01:27:08,373
They were on their way back.

1000
01:27:15,000 --> 01:27:17,170
It was a stray bullet or... maybe...

1001
01:27:17,333 --> 01:27:18,083
I don't know.

1002
01:27:22,791 --> 01:27:23,871
I don't think they suffered.

1003
01:27:25,250 --> 01:27:26,290
I don't think so.

1004
01:27:28,750 --> 01:27:29,710
Is that true?

1005
01:27:31,583 --> 01:27:32,173
Yes.

1006
01:27:37,041 --> 01:27:37,541
He said

1007
01:27:38,708 --> 01:27:41,078
Dou and Lan were hit by stray bullets

1008
01:27:42,750 --> 01:27:44,040
that they didn't suffer.

1009
01:27:57,833 --> 01:27:58,583
Come in.

1010
01:28:00,250 --> 01:28:00,960
George.

1011
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:03,250
Come in. George.

1012
01:28:04,666 --> 01:28:05,326
It's me.

1013
01:28:09,000 --> 01:28:10,420
I only have two minutes.

1014
01:28:11,708 --> 01:28:13,458
The guards finally let me in.

1015
01:28:14,416 --> 01:28:15,116
These tools

1016
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:15,921
you need.

1017
01:28:19,416 --> 01:28:19,996
Thank you.

1018
01:28:21,375 --> 01:28:22,205
Now, listen to me.

1019
01:28:22,625 --> 01:28:25,495
- This permit was for my daughter.
- Right.

1020
01:28:25,708 --> 01:28:27,788
But I can't carry out my plan.

1021
01:28:28,750 --> 01:28:30,080
You are my only hope now.

1022
01:28:31,833 --> 01:28:33,503
The Japanese don't trust me anymore.

1023
01:28:33,666 --> 01:28:34,416
You are a Westerner.

1024
01:28:34,583 --> 01:28:35,623
You can help her.

1025
01:28:37,125 --> 01:28:39,575
My daughter wouldn't leave
without her classmates.

1026
01:28:39,958 --> 01:28:42,538
Please think of a way to get her out of Nanking.

1027
01:28:42,708 --> 01:28:45,418
The permit is only good for a short time.

1028
01:28:46,041 --> 01:28:47,711
When you manage to leave the church,

1029
01:28:47,916 --> 01:28:49,996
remember, head west.

1030
01:28:50,500 --> 01:28:52,330
There's a way out of the city there.

1031
01:28:53,291 --> 01:28:54,331
I have to go.

1032
01:28:54,916 --> 01:28:55,576
Thank you, Mr. Meng.

1033
01:28:55,750 --> 01:28:57,000
Mr. Meng, thank you.

1034
01:28:57,166 --> 01:28:57,616
Mr. Meng,

1035
01:28:57,791 --> 01:28:59,121
with your connections...

1036
01:28:59,291 --> 01:29:00,331
is there anything else you can do for us?

1037
01:29:00,500 --> 01:29:01,540
No, no, sorry.

1038
01:29:01,833 --> 01:29:02,463
John,

1039
01:29:03,083 --> 01:29:05,123
I'm handing my daughter over to you.

1040
01:29:06,875 --> 01:29:08,415
I have promised her mother,

1041
01:29:09,125 --> 01:29:10,825
I'll take good care of her.

1042
01:29:11,083 --> 01:29:11,623
OK.

1043
01:29:12,166 --> 01:29:12,786
Please.

1044
01:29:15,625 --> 01:29:16,455
Mr. Meng,

1045
01:29:16,833 --> 01:29:17,503
thank you.

1046
01:29:17,916 --> 01:29:18,956
Thank you for this.

1047
01:29:19,291 --> 01:29:20,331
You are a good man.

1048
01:29:21,916 --> 01:29:23,286
In the eyes of my daughter,

1049
01:29:24,083 --> 01:29:25,083
I'm a bad man,

1050
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:26,460
a traitor.

1051
01:29:26,875 --> 01:29:27,415
No.

1052
01:29:28,791 --> 01:29:29,461
Thank you.

1053
01:30:33,500 --> 01:30:35,250
Damn Mosquito, her cat ran off.

1054
01:30:35,416 --> 01:30:36,326
She went up to look for it.

1055
01:31:05,583 --> 01:31:06,213
Good.

1056
01:31:07,416 --> 01:31:08,826
You sing very well.

1057
01:31:23,875 --> 01:31:24,665
Haven't I told you?

1058
01:31:25,041 --> 01:31:26,121
You can't come out!

1059
01:31:27,541 --> 01:31:28,371
Officer,

1060
01:31:29,166 --> 01:31:31,996
this student has lost her uniform.

1061
01:31:32,541 --> 01:31:35,251
Because we wanted to look our best today,

1062
01:31:36,208 --> 01:31:39,578
we asked her not to
participate in the performance.

1063
01:31:40,708 --> 01:31:42,538
Please forgive the intrusion.

1064
01:31:55,416 --> 01:31:55,996
Father,

1065
01:31:56,958 --> 01:31:58,918
I would like to announce some good news.

1066
01:31:59,708 --> 01:32:01,368
Tomorrow our division is celebrating

1067
01:32:01,541 --> 01:32:03,791
the successful occupation of Nanking.

1068
01:32:04,208 --> 01:32:05,248
Esteemed Father,

1069
01:32:05,791 --> 01:32:07,371
on behalf of all the officers,

1070
01:32:07,625 --> 01:32:09,615
I would like to invite your church choir

1071
01:32:09,791 --> 01:32:11,751
to perform and celebrate with us.

1072
01:32:22,208 --> 01:32:24,248
This is the official invitation.

1073
01:32:29,208 --> 01:32:31,288
They are asking us to sing at a party tomorrow.

1074
01:32:35,375 --> 01:32:36,745
This is a very kind invitation,

1075
01:32:37,125 --> 01:32:37,995
Mr. Hasegawa.

1076
01:32:39,083 --> 01:32:40,463
However, unfortunately,

1077
01:32:40,625 --> 01:32:42,455
the children will not be able to attend.

1078
01:32:42,958 --> 01:32:43,748
Why not?

1079
01:32:43,916 --> 01:32:45,116
Sir, they're very young.

1080
01:32:45,791 --> 01:32:47,751
I'm not sure that it is appropriate

1081
01:32:47,916 --> 01:32:49,666
for them to attend an adults' party.

1082
01:32:49,916 --> 01:32:51,456
As their guardian and protector,

1083
01:32:51,625 --> 01:32:52,785
that's my responsibility.

1084
01:32:53,750 --> 01:32:54,960
But we thank you very much.

1085
01:32:57,208 --> 01:32:58,118
I am sorry.

1086
01:32:58,375 --> 01:32:59,955
This is an order from above.

1087
01:33:00,291 --> 01:33:01,501
I cannot disobey.

1088
01:33:07,083 --> 01:33:07,673
Sir.

1089
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:09,330
Please think about the girls.

1090
01:33:09,916 --> 01:33:12,076
I can see that you are a man with culture.

1091
01:33:12,250 --> 01:33:14,000
Last time you played us a beautiful song,

1092
01:33:14,166 --> 01:33:15,826
for people far from home.

1093
01:33:16,291 --> 01:33:19,211
You missed the rivers and hills.

1094
01:33:19,875 --> 01:33:22,415
Please consider that theirs have been destroyed,

1095
01:33:22,791 --> 01:33:24,871
they have no home, nothing.

1096
01:33:25,666 --> 01:33:26,866
They are living in hell.

1097
01:33:27,708 --> 01:33:28,498
With this invitation,

1098
01:33:28,666 --> 01:33:30,786
you are asking them to celebrate that.

1099
01:33:31,333 --> 01:33:32,673
I know that you understand.

1100
01:33:32,875 --> 01:33:34,205
With respect, sir,

1101
01:33:34,625 --> 01:33:36,665
I cannot allow that. I think that is...

1102
01:33:39,083 --> 01:33:40,503
I think that is brutal, sir.

1103
01:33:43,750 --> 01:33:44,960
Please remember,

1104
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,290
tomorrow at four in the afternoon,

1105
01:33:47,458 --> 01:33:49,288
a car will come to pick up the students.

1106
01:33:49,708 --> 01:33:51,998
I am carrying out military orders.

1107
01:33:52,166 --> 01:33:53,076
Mr. Hasegawa,

1108
01:33:54,625 --> 01:33:57,075
you tell me what will happen
at these celebrations.

1109
01:34:01,916 --> 01:34:04,206
Mr. Hasegawa.

1110
01:34:07,125 --> 01:34:09,705
You said you posted guards for our security.

1111
01:34:10,041 --> 01:34:11,041
Have you been keeping these girls

1112
01:34:11,208 --> 01:34:13,208
locked up until these celebrations?

1113
01:34:17,791 --> 01:34:20,041
The children cannot go.

1114
01:34:22,125 --> 01:34:23,115
Mr. Hasegawa.

1115
01:34:24,166 --> 01:34:25,246
Mr. Hasegawa!

1116
01:34:26,125 --> 01:34:31,075
The children cannot go!

1117
01:34:46,583 --> 01:34:49,003
One, two, three, four,

1118
01:34:49,166 --> 01:34:51,416
five, six, seven, eight,

1119
01:34:51,583 --> 01:34:53,253
night, ten, eleven,

1120
01:34:53,416 --> 01:34:55,166
twelve, thirteen.

1121
01:34:56,750 --> 01:34:57,580
All,

1122
01:34:59,000 --> 01:34:59,920
must go!

1123
01:35:22,291 --> 01:35:23,121
Father John,

1124
01:35:25,250 --> 01:35:27,620
what do the Japanese want us to do?

1125
01:35:27,875 --> 01:35:29,455
Do they want us to sing?

1126
01:35:30,125 --> 01:35:30,825
Yeah.

1127
01:35:33,291 --> 01:35:34,461
I'm not a student.

1128
01:35:35,125 --> 01:35:36,415
I don't have to go.

1129
01:35:41,208 --> 01:35:42,748
Well, I'm not a student.

1130
01:35:43,416 --> 01:35:44,286
I won't go.

1131
01:35:44,541 --> 01:35:45,121
You have to!

1132
01:35:45,291 --> 01:35:46,461
The Japanese have counted you!

1133
01:35:46,625 --> 01:35:48,165
I don't care, I won't go!

1134
01:35:48,333 --> 01:35:49,423
You have to go!

1135
01:35:49,750 --> 01:35:51,000
Now you're saying you aren't a student.

1136
01:35:51,166 --> 01:35:52,536
Why didn't you tell the Japanese earlier?

1137
01:35:57,666 --> 01:36:00,746
Stop staring at me!

1138
01:36:00,958 --> 01:36:02,578
Save your attitude for the Japanese!

1139
01:36:04,000 --> 01:36:04,500
Do you think the Japanese

1140
01:36:04,666 --> 01:36:06,076
really invited you to sing?

1141
01:36:06,708 --> 01:36:07,668
Dream on!

1142
01:36:08,250 --> 01:36:10,120
What do they do all day in Nanking?

1143
01:36:10,541 --> 01:36:12,171
They murder, burn,

1144
01:36:12,333 --> 01:36:13,293
and rape!

1145
01:36:13,583 --> 01:36:14,333
You know?

1146
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:16,120
Go ahead and go,

1147
01:36:16,500 --> 01:36:17,250
but I won't go!

1148
01:36:17,416 --> 01:36:18,496
Mosquito, you shut up!

1149
01:36:22,208 --> 01:36:23,498
You are all mean to me!

1150
01:36:23,666 --> 01:36:25,366
I'm not going!

1151
01:36:43,708 --> 01:36:45,958
That's not true what she said.

1152
01:36:46,875 --> 01:36:49,825
These men are different from the others.

1153
01:36:50,708 --> 01:36:52,078
These men are educated.

1154
01:36:52,666 --> 01:36:53,706
They are officers.

1155
01:36:54,708 --> 01:36:55,868
These men are gentlemen.

1156
01:36:57,875 --> 01:37:01,365
I've been to things like these before, and...

1157
01:37:02,000 --> 01:37:02,920
it's nice.

1158
01:37:03,125 --> 01:37:05,365
It's elegant, it's a...

1159
01:37:05,791 --> 01:37:06,711
It's a party.

1160
01:37:07,875 --> 01:37:08,955
There's nice things at parties.

1161
01:37:09,125 --> 01:37:10,495
There's cakes and there's flowers

1162
01:37:10,666 --> 01:37:12,286
and there's chocolates and there's dancing...

1163
01:37:12,458 --> 01:37:15,418
and there's... all of these things,
which are lovely.

1164
01:37:17,375 --> 01:37:19,365
Please don't think about what she said.

1165
01:37:22,833 --> 01:37:24,293
I'm a terrible dancer,

1166
01:37:25,416 --> 01:37:26,746
and maybe one day one of you could

1167
01:37:26,916 --> 01:37:29,416
teach me how to dance. That would be nice.

1168
01:37:33,083 --> 01:37:34,503
Please don't think about that.

1169
01:37:35,458 --> 01:37:36,708
Because that's not true.

1170
01:38:02,208 --> 01:38:02,998
I...

1171
01:38:05,625 --> 01:38:06,915
lied to you as well.

1172
01:38:07,541 --> 01:38:10,461
Your two friends who went for the pipa strings,

1173
01:38:10,916 --> 01:38:12,116
they weren't shot.

1174
01:38:14,166 --> 01:38:14,866
I'm sorry.

1175
01:38:15,666 --> 01:38:16,996
I think you already knew.

1176
01:38:18,708 --> 01:38:19,288
Yes.

1177
01:38:23,750 --> 01:38:24,620
Sometimes,

1178
01:38:24,791 --> 01:38:27,711
the truth is the last thing we need to hear.

1179
01:38:41,125 --> 01:38:43,035
I heard what you said to the girls.

1180
01:38:44,541 --> 01:38:45,671
What are you gonna do?

1181
01:38:46,208 --> 01:38:47,868
I gotta get the truck started.

1182
01:38:49,375 --> 01:38:50,365
And after that?

1183
01:38:54,500 --> 01:38:55,830
I have an idea.

1184
01:38:57,083 --> 01:38:59,003
Maybe I can save one of them,

1185
01:38:59,791 --> 01:39:00,541
with your help.

1186
01:39:01,458 --> 01:39:02,038
How?

1187
01:39:02,750 --> 01:39:03,500
The Japanese thought

1188
01:39:03,666 --> 01:39:05,666
Mosquito was one of the girls.

1189
01:39:06,333 --> 01:39:07,423
She tricked them.

1190
01:39:08,000 --> 01:39:08,830
Why can't I?

1191
01:39:12,333 --> 01:39:12,963
No.

1192
01:39:13,666 --> 01:39:15,036
If you're saying what I think you're saying,

1193
01:39:15,208 --> 01:39:17,038
no.

1194
01:39:18,208 --> 01:39:19,208
That's not happening.

1195
01:39:21,500 --> 01:39:22,710
Remember? Like them,

1196
01:39:22,875 --> 01:39:24,955
I was at a convent for six years.

1197
01:39:28,375 --> 01:39:29,365
But unlike them,

1198
01:39:30,333 --> 01:39:32,253
I was raped by my stepfather

1199
01:39:32,416 --> 01:39:34,616
when I was thirteen years old.

1200
01:39:39,625 --> 01:39:40,825
By their age,

1201
01:39:42,125 --> 01:39:45,495
I was already forced to take my first clients.

1202
01:39:49,958 --> 01:39:51,708
I don't want them to go through that.

1203
01:39:55,250 --> 01:39:57,080
But I can't let you do that, Mo.

1204
01:40:00,333 --> 01:40:01,753
I can't let you do that.

1205
01:40:13,083 --> 01:40:13,793
What are you doing?

1206
01:40:14,916 --> 01:40:15,706
Get back in.

1207
01:40:16,666 --> 01:40:17,666
You can't leave.

1208
01:40:18,250 --> 01:40:18,920
Get back in!

1209
01:40:19,416 --> 01:40:20,116
Get in there!

1210
01:40:21,416 --> 01:40:22,036
What are you doing?

1211
01:40:23,625 --> 01:40:24,415
Go back!

1212
01:40:26,541 --> 01:40:27,371
I said go back in!

1213
01:40:59,708 --> 01:41:00,868
I will be the first.

1214
01:41:01,625 --> 01:41:03,785
Remember who's in front of you.

1215
01:41:04,083 --> 01:41:05,043
When we go,

1216
01:41:05,208 --> 01:41:06,708
we will stick to this order.

1217
01:41:07,458 --> 01:41:09,958
Shu, isn't there a better solution?

1218
01:41:10,625 --> 01:41:11,535
No.

1219
01:41:12,541 --> 01:41:13,671
We won't let the Japanese

1220
01:41:13,833 --> 01:41:15,373
hurt us again.

1221
01:41:46,291 --> 01:41:46,871
Girls.

1222
01:41:47,291 --> 01:41:48,331
Shu!

1223
01:41:48,500 --> 01:41:49,370
Wait, just...

1224
01:41:50,583 --> 01:41:51,373
Go away!

1225
01:41:51,541 --> 01:41:52,081
Come down!

1226
01:41:52,250 --> 01:41:53,330
OK, OK.

1227
01:41:53,500 --> 01:41:55,170
Stay back, OK.

1228
01:41:55,500 --> 01:41:56,790
Don't do anything foolish!

1229
01:41:56,958 --> 01:41:57,998
So many people have died.

1230
01:41:58,166 --> 01:41:59,166
Even hell is packed.

1231
01:41:59,375 --> 01:42:00,665
Why should you add to the crowd?

1232
01:42:04,291 --> 01:42:06,581
Shu, don't do this.

1233
01:42:06,833 --> 01:42:08,043
You can't do this!

1234
01:42:08,458 --> 01:42:10,208
We can't just throw our lives away.

1235
01:42:10,666 --> 01:42:12,456
Life is a sacred gift.

1236
01:42:12,958 --> 01:42:14,668
It's not ours to throw away.

1237
01:42:16,666 --> 01:42:18,286
Keep away! Step back!

1238
01:42:18,583 --> 01:42:19,373
OK.

1239
01:42:19,875 --> 01:42:22,825
We're stepping back.

1240
01:42:24,250 --> 01:42:24,920
Come up!

1241
01:42:25,750 --> 01:42:27,210
Didn't we say we are going to jump together?

1242
01:42:28,416 --> 01:42:29,076
Up here!

1243
01:42:30,833 --> 01:42:31,503
Come up now!

1244
01:42:32,666 --> 01:42:34,866
Listen to me, Shu, I have an idea.

1245
01:42:35,083 --> 01:42:35,923
I will go in your place.

1246
01:42:38,416 --> 01:42:39,746
Tell the girls to get down.

1247
01:42:40,375 --> 01:42:41,285
Tomorrow I will go for you.

1248
01:42:41,666 --> 01:42:43,326
Did you hear me? I will go in your place!

1249
01:42:44,166 --> 01:42:46,786
What? Who is going in who's place?

1250
01:42:51,541 --> 01:42:52,751
I will also go for you.

1251
01:42:52,916 --> 01:42:53,786
Right, we will all go instead of you.

1252
01:42:53,958 --> 01:42:54,668
We can handle the Japs.

1253
01:42:54,833 --> 01:42:55,833
We will protect you.

1254
01:42:56,000 --> 01:42:56,670
We will replace you!

1255
01:42:56,833 --> 01:42:58,583
Don't worry, you have us to protect you.

1256
01:42:58,750 --> 01:43:00,460
Yes, we won't let the Japanese hurt you.

1257
01:43:00,625 --> 01:43:01,535
Do you hear us?

1258
01:43:01,708 --> 01:43:02,918
We will go in your place.

1259
01:43:03,083 --> 01:43:05,293
Come down and don't jump.

1260
01:43:05,458 --> 01:43:06,458
Come down.

1261
01:43:06,750 --> 01:43:09,040
We're telling them the idea I told you about.

1262
01:43:11,458 --> 01:43:14,118
It's a good idea. That's it, girls.

1263
01:43:14,458 --> 01:43:15,748
Shu, come here,

1264
01:43:15,916 --> 01:43:17,456
it's a good idea.

1265
01:43:17,708 --> 01:43:18,958
We can trick the Japanese.

1266
01:43:19,583 --> 01:43:21,043
Alright? We'll make it fun.

1267
01:43:21,250 --> 01:43:23,250
Come down, we think about it.

1268
01:43:23,541 --> 01:43:25,421
We just come down, and think about it.

1269
01:43:26,541 --> 01:43:27,581
We can make it work.

1270
01:43:35,833 --> 01:43:37,423
We only said it so they would

1271
01:43:37,583 --> 01:43:38,503
get down from the tower.

1272
01:43:41,750 --> 01:43:44,040
But you shouldn't have lied to them.

1273
01:43:44,500 --> 01:43:45,540
Hua, remember?

1274
01:43:45,708 --> 01:43:46,618
If you weren't lied to,

1275
01:43:46,791 --> 01:43:48,621
you wouldn't have ended up in a brothel.

1276
01:43:48,791 --> 01:43:50,671
Shut up! Mosquito.

1277
01:43:50,958 --> 01:43:51,918
I'm not stupid.

1278
01:43:52,125 --> 01:43:53,575
If nobody goes you'll still have to go.

1279
01:43:53,750 --> 01:43:55,920
You were counted by the Japanese!

1280
01:43:58,958 --> 01:44:01,038
Unless the Japanese are insane,

1281
01:44:01,208 --> 01:44:02,868
I don't think they will kill us.

1282
01:44:03,625 --> 01:44:05,115
They just want pleasure.

1283
01:44:05,458 --> 01:44:06,828
That's what we do.

1284
01:44:07,541 --> 01:44:09,041
We have experienced all kinds of men.

1285
01:44:09,625 --> 01:44:10,995
As long as we can get out alive,

1286
01:44:11,375 --> 01:44:12,785
we will find a way to survive.

1287
01:44:13,583 --> 01:44:14,213
Ling,

1288
01:44:14,916 --> 01:44:15,956
how do you expect the girls

1289
01:44:16,125 --> 01:44:17,035
to handle the Japanese?

1290
01:44:18,791 --> 01:44:20,001
Even if they make it back alive,

1291
01:44:21,208 --> 01:44:22,328
they won't be able to carry on.

1292
01:44:24,458 --> 01:44:25,748
I just don't think it's worth it.

1293
01:44:26,791 --> 01:44:28,501
They wouldn't even let us use the bathroom,

1294
01:44:28,791 --> 01:44:29,961
yet, we're supposed to kiss their asses,

1295
01:44:30,291 --> 01:44:31,671
and sacrifice ourselves for them?

1296
01:44:31,833 --> 01:44:33,713
I don't want to hear your nonsense.

1297
01:44:34,541 --> 01:44:36,581
If Shu hadn't diverted the Japs the other day,

1298
01:44:37,125 --> 01:44:39,415
where would we all be right now?

1299
01:44:43,541 --> 01:44:45,621
Remember how the ancient poem describes us?

1300
01:44:48,541 --> 01:44:49,961
"Prostitutes never care about a falling nation,"

1301
01:44:50,125 --> 01:44:51,615
"they sing and dance while others are dying."

1302
01:44:51,916 --> 01:44:53,536
You are not so foolish after all.

1303
01:44:53,916 --> 01:44:55,246
I'm impressed.

1304
01:44:55,458 --> 01:44:56,998
Mo just taught me those two lines.

1305
01:44:57,625 --> 01:44:58,705
Of course we should remember

1306
01:44:58,875 --> 01:45:00,365
the poem that criticizes us.

1307
01:45:00,708 --> 01:45:01,538
But, I think,

1308
01:45:02,041 --> 01:45:04,251
we should do something heroic,

1309
01:45:04,708 --> 01:45:06,458
and change the old way of thinking.

1310
01:45:13,708 --> 01:45:14,538
Mo,

1311
01:45:15,083 --> 01:45:18,373
others say I always follow your lead,

1312
01:45:19,166 --> 01:45:20,496
I say, we share the same life.

1313
01:45:21,166 --> 01:45:21,996
Whatever you say,

1314
01:45:22,583 --> 01:45:23,463
I will go with you.

1315
01:45:24,333 --> 01:45:25,213
I will go too.

1316
01:45:27,125 --> 01:45:27,865
Me too.

1317
01:45:29,375 --> 01:45:30,165
Count me in.

1318
01:45:32,625 --> 01:45:33,245
Mo,

1319
01:45:35,125 --> 01:45:37,955
we worked together for three years,

1320
01:45:38,625 --> 01:45:40,495
and you were always more popular than me.

1321
01:45:41,250 --> 01:45:42,080
I know,

1322
01:45:42,916 --> 01:45:44,076
you always looked down on me,

1323
01:45:44,916 --> 01:45:46,286
and I never respected you either.

1324
01:45:47,625 --> 01:45:48,245
Well,

1325
01:45:48,625 --> 01:45:49,825
today I hear you.

1326
01:45:50,958 --> 01:45:51,618
I say

1327
01:45:52,041 --> 01:45:53,081
we all go,

1328
01:45:53,625 --> 01:45:54,665
so we can look after each other.

1329
01:45:55,166 --> 01:45:56,246
Mo, you are right.

1330
01:45:56,750 --> 01:45:57,750
People say

1331
01:45:57,916 --> 01:45:58,996
"whores are heartless."

1332
01:46:00,416 --> 01:46:01,286
So tomorrow,

1333
01:46:01,458 --> 01:46:03,328
let's do something honorable with our hearts.

1334
01:46:05,416 --> 01:46:06,456
We will all go.

1335
01:46:11,166 --> 01:46:12,666
If they went,

1336
01:46:13,583 --> 01:46:16,043
how would the Japanese treat them?

1337
01:46:19,083 --> 01:46:21,713
Will they tear their clothes?

1338
01:46:24,000 --> 01:46:25,290
Will they beat them?

1339
01:46:27,666 --> 01:46:31,496
What if the Japanese rape them?

1340
01:46:31,791 --> 01:46:32,541
Are you kidding?

1341
01:46:33,541 --> 01:46:34,041
No.

1342
01:46:34,791 --> 01:46:35,791
Have you seen these women?

1343
01:46:36,625 --> 01:46:38,955
Those Japanese don't stand a chance.

1344
01:46:40,666 --> 01:46:42,996
These women... these women are formidable.

1345
01:46:44,333 --> 01:46:46,123
Brave, exquisite,

1346
01:46:47,041 --> 01:46:47,921
skillful.

1347
01:46:48,666 --> 01:46:49,616
They've got character,

1348
01:46:49,791 --> 01:46:51,671
like nobody I've ever met.

1349
01:46:52,458 --> 01:46:53,668
The Japanese?

1350
01:46:54,791 --> 01:46:56,711
They're amateurs, amateurs.

1351
01:46:57,041 --> 01:46:58,041
These women,

1352
01:46:59,083 --> 01:47:00,873
they are professionals.

1353
01:47:02,166 --> 01:47:02,916
Father John,

1354
01:47:04,083 --> 01:47:06,003
what exactly do they do?

1355
01:47:11,291 --> 01:47:12,251
You know... they...

1356
01:47:12,875 --> 01:47:15,495
They love and they hate, just like all of us.

1357
01:47:15,666 --> 01:47:18,706
Maybe they know more about it than any of us.

1358
01:47:19,958 --> 01:47:21,958
These women if they came

1359
01:47:22,125 --> 01:47:24,115
face to face with the devil himself,

1360
01:47:24,416 --> 01:47:26,326
he'd be putty in their hands.

1361
01:47:26,583 --> 01:47:28,543
These idiot? These soldiers?

1362
01:47:30,333 --> 01:47:31,463
You think they're scary?

1363
01:47:31,625 --> 01:47:33,075
They're not scary.

1364
01:47:33,500 --> 01:47:35,000
If you think somebody's scary,

1365
01:47:35,250 --> 01:47:36,750
you picture them with their pants around

1366
01:47:36,875 --> 01:47:39,205
their ankles, sitting on the crapper, alright?

1367
01:47:39,375 --> 01:47:40,325
Picture that.

1368
01:47:41,750 --> 01:47:42,870
Not so scary then.

1369
01:47:44,208 --> 01:47:46,118
These women, and you girls,

1370
01:47:46,666 --> 01:47:51,206
you gotta strength and beauty that will never die.

1371
01:47:51,708 --> 01:47:53,208
So don't you worry about them.

1372
01:47:54,958 --> 01:47:56,208
Don't worry about them.

1373
01:47:58,041 --> 01:47:58,711
But...

1374
01:47:59,333 --> 01:48:02,793
but they don't look anything like us,

1375
01:48:03,875 --> 01:48:05,035
how can they go?

1376
01:48:07,708 --> 01:48:09,208
That's where my powers come in.

1377
01:48:10,208 --> 01:48:11,708
I don't do much very well.

1378
01:48:12,250 --> 01:48:15,540
But that, that I do well.

1379
01:48:16,375 --> 01:48:18,745
And I'll make them look like your twins.

1380
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:21,290
You'll see.

1381
01:48:29,000 --> 01:48:29,960
Father John,

1382
01:48:30,625 --> 01:48:31,615
I was wrong,

1383
01:48:32,666 --> 01:48:33,916
I'm sorry.

1384
01:48:34,708 --> 01:48:36,668
Shu, you don't have to be sorry.

1385
01:48:37,916 --> 01:48:39,496
You don't have to be sorry.

1386
01:48:39,791 --> 01:48:41,751
No, I was wrong.

1387
01:48:42,541 --> 01:48:43,331
What is it?

1388
01:48:44,458 --> 01:48:48,118
From the first day she came here,

1389
01:48:48,666 --> 01:48:50,326
I felt uncomfortable.

1390
01:48:52,375 --> 01:48:53,205
I thought

1391
01:48:54,875 --> 01:48:56,075
she was not good.

1392
01:48:56,875 --> 01:48:57,915
I even thought

1393
01:48:58,500 --> 01:49:01,960
both of you were not good.

1394
01:49:02,916 --> 01:49:03,996
That's ok.

1395
01:49:04,166 --> 01:49:05,956
I want to say to her,

1396
01:49:06,541 --> 01:49:07,291
sorry.

1397
01:49:07,833 --> 01:49:09,173
And say to you,

1398
01:49:10,041 --> 01:49:11,251
I'm sorry.

1399
01:49:11,625 --> 01:49:13,365
You don't have to say you're sorry.

1400
01:49:17,833 --> 01:49:19,923
You got nothing to be sorry about.

1401
01:49:37,916 --> 01:49:40,116
I had seen many people pray before,

1402
01:49:40,541 --> 01:49:41,961
but that night, the sight of

1403
01:49:42,416 --> 01:49:43,416
John's back as he prayed

1404
01:49:43,583 --> 01:49:45,623
would stay with me for the rest of my life.

1405
01:49:53,500 --> 01:49:55,870
They brought new uniforms.

1406
01:49:59,666 --> 01:50:01,326
Our old uniforms were torn,

1407
01:50:02,333 --> 01:50:03,253
so I brought you new ones.

1408
01:50:04,333 --> 01:50:05,873
Father Ingleman wanted us

1409
01:50:06,291 --> 01:50:07,501
to wear them for Christmas.

1410
01:50:08,125 --> 01:50:09,415
You don't mind me wearing it?

1411
01:50:09,958 --> 01:50:11,038
The sleeves are short.

1412
01:50:12,000 --> 01:50:13,040
Try it on.

1413
01:50:15,500 --> 01:50:16,170
Big sister.

1414
01:50:22,083 --> 01:50:23,463
I can't button it up for you.

1415
01:50:23,916 --> 01:50:25,616
I'm already skinnier from starvation.

1416
01:50:26,375 --> 01:50:27,495
You are not built like a student,

1417
01:50:27,666 --> 01:50:29,366
more like a student's wet nurse!

1418
01:50:35,875 --> 01:50:37,035
I have an idea,

1419
01:50:37,333 --> 01:50:38,503
to fool the Japanese,

1420
01:50:38,666 --> 01:50:39,576
let's use the curtains

1421
01:50:39,750 --> 01:50:40,870
to make the uniforms fit,

1422
01:50:41,041 --> 01:50:42,041
and tear up the sheets

1423
01:50:42,208 --> 01:50:43,458
to wrap our chests.

1424
01:50:43,625 --> 01:50:45,365
So, our boobs won't pop out.

1425
01:52:09,541 --> 01:52:10,791
What're we doing, George?

1426
01:52:11,375 --> 01:52:12,115
What're we doing?

1427
01:52:12,750 --> 01:52:14,120
Listen, your God teaches,

1428
01:52:14,458 --> 01:52:15,958
everybody's born equal, right?

1429
01:52:16,125 --> 01:52:18,455
So, the women, the girls, which?

1430
01:52:20,416 --> 01:52:21,326
What would you do?

1431
01:52:22,958 --> 01:52:23,788
We must.

1432
01:52:25,291 --> 01:52:26,711
What else we can do?

1433
01:52:34,833 --> 01:52:36,373
He gave me these bracelets

1434
01:52:37,166 --> 01:52:38,116
so I would go with him.

1435
01:52:39,583 --> 01:52:42,873
I didn't trust him enough so I didn't.

1436
01:52:44,250 --> 01:52:46,210
I should have.

1437
01:52:47,875 --> 01:52:48,575
I was so stupid.

1438
01:52:49,125 --> 01:52:50,705
You would be even more stupid

1439
01:52:50,875 --> 01:52:51,705
wearing them to meet the Japs.

1440
01:52:52,041 --> 01:52:52,871
Leave them here.

1441
01:52:53,958 --> 01:52:55,668
Fine, they are yours now.

1442
01:53:00,208 --> 01:53:01,498
When I was your age,

1443
01:53:01,708 --> 01:53:03,538
I had already served countless men.

1444
01:53:04,208 --> 01:53:05,038
Little sister,

1445
01:53:05,750 --> 01:53:07,170
remember to give this back to me.

1446
01:53:07,750 --> 01:53:08,330
I will use the money

1447
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:09,920
to buy myself out of my contract.

1448
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:17,580
Big sister, I'm sorry.

1449
01:53:19,833 --> 01:53:21,833
Live a good life for me.

1450
01:53:28,958 --> 01:53:30,828
I don't have any things of value,

1451
01:53:31,291 --> 01:53:32,541
that cat is all I have.

1452
01:53:32,791 --> 01:53:34,371
He ran away the other day.

1453
01:53:34,750 --> 01:53:35,540
Little sister,

1454
01:53:37,125 --> 01:53:38,245
you will find him.

1455
01:53:38,583 --> 01:53:39,083
OK.

1456
01:53:50,000 --> 01:53:51,120
Remember Dou?

1457
01:53:51,750 --> 01:53:52,960
She wasn't much taller than you.

1458
01:53:54,250 --> 01:53:55,460
Please take good care of it.

1459
01:53:56,333 --> 01:53:57,623
This is Dou's life.

1460
01:53:59,333 --> 01:54:01,373
She wanted to play "The Qin Huai View,"

1461
01:54:01,583 --> 01:54:03,083
and for that she was killed.

1462
01:54:06,708 --> 01:54:07,708
"The Qin Huai View."

1463
01:54:09,166 --> 01:54:10,746
Is that a beautiful song?

1464
01:54:11,041 --> 01:54:13,251
That's our signature song at Jade Paradise.

1465
01:54:15,750 --> 01:54:17,370
Why don't we sing it for Dou?

1466
01:54:17,541 --> 01:54:18,961
It was her dying wish after all.

1467
01:54:19,250 --> 01:54:21,080
Let's sing it for the girls,

1468
01:54:21,333 --> 01:54:22,793
so they remember us at our best!

1469
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:36,250
"I have a story,"

1470
01:54:36,458 --> 01:54:41,248
"and let me put it into song."

1471
01:54:41,708 --> 01:54:46,668
"I hope every one of you"

1472
01:54:46,833 --> 01:54:51,793
"can listen to me patiently."

1473
01:54:51,958 --> 01:54:54,458
"Allow me"

1474
01:54:54,625 --> 01:55:02,205
"to sing the legend of the Qin Huai River,"

1475
01:55:02,375 --> 01:55:07,285
"slowly and passionately,"

1476
01:55:07,583 --> 01:55:13,673
"for each one of you."

1477
01:55:20,750 --> 01:55:25,790
"Ever since the ancient era,"

1478
01:55:25,958 --> 01:55:30,618
"the river has been flowing gracefully."

1479
01:55:31,166 --> 01:55:36,206
"It is the beauty of the South,"

1480
01:55:36,333 --> 01:55:41,373
"the elegance of Nanking."

1481
01:55:41,541 --> 01:55:43,961
"Walk in the famous Zhan Palace,"

1482
01:55:44,125 --> 01:55:51,825
"enjoy the spectacular architecture."

1483
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:54,170
"Look at the Colony of Cranes"

1484
01:55:54,416 --> 01:55:56,706
"with water rippling all around."

1485
01:55:57,250 --> 01:56:04,870
"What a paradise this is."

1486
01:56:06,875 --> 01:56:08,245
Mo, would...

1487
01:56:10,500 --> 01:56:11,790
You look so sweet.

1488
01:56:17,208 --> 01:56:19,498
Would you mind... lying down?

1489
01:56:21,583 --> 01:56:23,003
I'm just not used to...

1490
01:56:23,916 --> 01:56:24,956
People who can sit?

1491
01:56:25,125 --> 01:56:26,535
Right, people who can sit.

1492
01:56:28,125 --> 01:56:28,865
Would you mind?

1493
01:56:29,041 --> 01:56:30,461
I understand, I don't mind.

1494
01:56:40,291 --> 01:56:42,461
So madam, what will it be?

1495
01:56:44,708 --> 01:56:46,038
Fourteen years old?

1496
01:56:47,583 --> 01:56:48,833
How about thirteen?

1497
01:56:53,583 --> 01:56:55,753
Until thirteen I was a good girl.

1498
01:56:56,833 --> 01:56:57,543
Very good.

1499
01:56:58,583 --> 01:56:59,583
Thirteen it is.

1500
01:57:01,083 --> 01:57:02,373
So I'll straighten your hair,

1501
01:57:03,416 --> 01:57:04,496
cut it in a bob.

1502
01:57:09,125 --> 01:57:10,165
I have an idea,

1503
01:57:12,166 --> 01:57:13,576
I think it'll be beautiful.

1504
01:57:17,333 --> 01:57:18,463
This is what we need.

1505
01:57:19,833 --> 01:57:20,753
It's perfect.

1506
01:57:35,041 --> 01:57:36,211
The way you are now,

1507
01:57:38,125 --> 01:57:39,535
is what I like the best.

1508
01:57:42,791 --> 01:57:43,671
I see you.

1509
01:57:46,125 --> 01:57:48,455
I see everything that you've been through.

1510
01:57:51,166 --> 01:57:52,786
And I want all of that, Mo.

1511
01:57:54,458 --> 01:57:55,328
I want all of it.

1512
01:57:57,458 --> 01:57:58,118
I love it.

1513
01:57:59,125 --> 01:57:59,995
I love it all.

1514
01:58:03,791 --> 01:58:05,581
Are you going to fall in love with me?

1515
01:58:08,291 --> 01:58:09,421
I already have.

1516
01:58:37,916 --> 01:58:39,166
I can do this.

1517
01:58:42,375 --> 01:58:43,955
Sorry, these are not my clothes.

1518
01:58:51,375 --> 01:58:52,995
I wanna promise you something.

1519
01:58:55,541 --> 01:58:57,001
When this war is over,

1520
01:58:57,791 --> 01:58:58,961
I'm gonna find you,

1521
01:59:02,166 --> 01:59:03,366
and I'm gonna take you home.

1522
01:59:07,208 --> 01:59:07,748
No.

1523
01:59:09,875 --> 01:59:10,825
After tonight,

1524
01:59:12,833 --> 01:59:15,373
my body will no longer be mine.

1525
01:59:21,250 --> 01:59:22,500
Take me home now.

1526
01:59:59,750 --> 02:00:00,830
Wow, Mo!

1527
02:00:01,000 --> 02:00:02,250
He can turn back time.

1528
02:00:02,458 --> 02:00:03,788
He chopped away five or six years!

1529
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:06,080
Three more chops and we'd all be infants,

1530
02:00:06,250 --> 02:00:08,000
so we can start our lives over again!

1531
02:00:08,166 --> 02:00:09,326
Have you asked him,

1532
02:00:09,500 --> 02:00:11,040
where he learned such skills?

1533
02:00:11,791 --> 02:00:12,421
Mo,

1534
02:00:12,583 --> 02:00:14,253
ask him to cut our hair too.

1535
02:00:15,708 --> 02:00:17,958
They all want you to give them a makeover.

1536
02:00:19,125 --> 02:00:20,075
My pleasure.

1537
02:00:20,958 --> 02:00:22,618
Glad to serve you.

1538
02:00:32,125 --> 02:00:32,705
Here.

1539
02:00:33,083 --> 02:00:34,423
He has to work with you lying down.

1540
02:00:35,916 --> 02:00:38,206
Right, he's a mortician,

1541
02:00:38,375 --> 02:00:39,825
he only knows how to work on dead people.

1542
02:00:40,125 --> 02:00:40,915
Are they disturbed...

1543
02:00:42,500 --> 02:00:43,290
by the way I work?

1544
02:00:43,500 --> 02:00:44,170
Sorry.

1545
02:00:45,791 --> 02:00:47,121
He hopes you won't mind.

1546
02:00:48,333 --> 02:00:50,003
Whatever, who cares?

1547
02:00:50,166 --> 02:00:52,496
I just want to look like a pretty schoolgirl.

1548
02:00:53,125 --> 02:00:54,205
Give me a coat.

1549
02:01:06,625 --> 02:01:08,165
His hands are so soft.

1550
02:01:08,416 --> 02:01:10,166
Mo, did he really work on the dead?

1551
02:01:10,916 --> 02:01:12,536
Mo, we're going to sleep.

1552
02:01:12,666 --> 02:01:14,166
Wake us up when it's our turn.

1553
02:01:27,458 --> 02:01:29,038
You've done this your whole life?

1554
02:01:30,208 --> 02:01:31,118
For five years.

1555
02:01:31,875 --> 02:01:33,245
You do this very well.

1556
02:01:38,583 --> 02:01:39,373
It matters.

1557
02:01:40,708 --> 02:01:41,868
It matters to me.

1558
02:01:44,708 --> 02:01:45,998
Before my daughter died,

1559
02:01:49,875 --> 02:01:51,075
she made me promise

1560
02:01:52,541 --> 02:01:53,921
to make her beautiful again.

1561
02:01:56,708 --> 02:01:57,958
That was the first time.

1562
02:02:00,750 --> 02:02:01,580
It's important.

1563
02:02:04,583 --> 02:02:05,583
It's important work.

1564
02:02:07,250 --> 02:02:08,080
I'm sorry.

1565
02:02:10,375 --> 02:02:11,745
She would have been twelve.

1566
02:02:14,791 --> 02:02:15,711
Like the girls.

1567
02:02:17,083 --> 02:02:17,583
Yeah.

1568
02:02:47,625 --> 02:02:49,495
Mo, he's amazing!

1569
02:02:51,208 --> 02:02:52,418
If only my mother were alive,

1570
02:02:52,583 --> 02:02:53,793
she would have been so happy

1571
02:02:54,041 --> 02:02:55,711
to see me like this.

1572
02:02:56,125 --> 02:02:56,955
She said,

1573
02:02:57,583 --> 02:02:59,673
we never had a scholar in our family.

1574
02:03:03,083 --> 02:03:05,293
Now you are a scholar, so am I.

1575
02:03:05,458 --> 02:03:07,328
My mother wouldn't recognize me either!

1576
02:03:07,500 --> 02:03:08,120
Of course not.

1577
02:03:08,291 --> 02:03:09,121
We are now students.

1578
02:03:09,291 --> 02:03:11,121
Let's line up.

1579
02:03:11,958 --> 02:03:13,998
Mo, let him see if we all look like students.

1580
02:03:20,291 --> 02:03:21,791
No need to count, we only have twelve.

1581
02:03:23,666 --> 02:03:24,666
We are one short.

1582
02:03:28,000 --> 02:03:29,580
How many did the Japanese say?

1583
02:03:32,541 --> 02:03:33,291
How many?

1584
02:03:35,583 --> 02:03:36,373
Thirteen.

1585
02:03:36,666 --> 02:03:37,366
How many?

1586
02:03:37,750 --> 02:03:40,670
Thirteen. We only have twelve here.

1587
02:03:42,583 --> 02:03:43,463
This is a terrible joke.

1588
02:03:45,333 --> 02:03:47,123
One of the students still has to go!

1589
02:03:47,333 --> 02:03:48,253
We did all of this for nothing!

1590
02:03:53,791 --> 02:03:54,621
I will go.

1591
02:03:57,125 --> 02:03:58,165
What did he say?

1592
02:03:58,500 --> 02:03:59,330
I will go.

1593
02:03:59,833 --> 02:04:00,503
George.

1594
02:04:01,208 --> 02:04:02,368
He said he would go.

1595
02:04:02,750 --> 02:04:04,000
What are you talking about?

1596
02:04:05,541 --> 02:04:06,421
You are a boy!

1597
02:04:12,041 --> 02:04:15,871
Father Ingleman ask me to protect students.

1598
02:04:16,333 --> 02:04:17,753
But I'm not good.

1599
02:04:18,083 --> 02:04:19,583
I'm... I'm terrible.

1600
02:04:20,208 --> 02:04:21,288
I'm... I'm bad.

1601
02:04:21,541 --> 02:04:23,371
Who cares if we are one short?

1602
02:04:23,541 --> 02:04:24,371
We will just say that

1603
02:04:24,541 --> 02:04:25,871
one of us has died from an illness.

1604
02:04:26,041 --> 02:04:27,171
My grandma told me that

1605
02:04:27,333 --> 02:04:28,673
the Japanese can't count.

1606
02:04:29,208 --> 02:04:30,038
We can't do that!

1607
02:04:30,208 --> 02:04:31,748
The Japanese are very astute!

1608
02:04:32,041 --> 02:04:33,371
They will search everywhere,

1609
02:04:33,541 --> 02:04:35,461
and it will be the end for the students!

1610
02:04:35,625 --> 02:04:36,575
There is nothing you can do.

1611
02:04:36,750 --> 02:04:38,290
They will see that you are a boy.

1612
02:04:38,458 --> 02:04:39,868
You can't fool them.

1613
02:04:40,208 --> 02:04:42,078
Yes, it's too obvious.

1614
02:04:42,291 --> 02:04:43,211
It's a short distance

1615
02:04:43,375 --> 02:04:44,285
from the church to the car.

1616
02:04:44,458 --> 02:04:45,288
If I am made-up as a girl,

1617
02:04:45,458 --> 02:04:46,458
lower my head,

1618
02:04:46,625 --> 02:04:48,825
and walk right behind you all,

1619
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:50,750
I'm sure the Japanese won't notice!

1620
02:04:52,083 --> 02:04:53,253
If we have one missing,

1621
02:04:53,708 --> 02:04:55,078
the Japanese will find out,

1622
02:04:55,375 --> 02:04:57,325
then... a big trouble.

1623
02:04:57,791 --> 02:05:00,171
You are good at make-up.

1624
02:05:00,333 --> 02:05:01,503
You can do for me.

1625
02:05:01,666 --> 02:05:03,496
George, I'm not that good.

1626
02:05:03,666 --> 02:05:05,786
No, you can.

1627
02:05:06,041 --> 02:05:07,371
George, stop it.

1628
02:05:07,541 --> 02:05:08,711
- It can't work.
- You can!

1629
02:05:11,250 --> 02:05:13,000
The church to the car

1630
02:05:13,166 --> 02:05:14,416
just a short way!

1631
02:05:14,916 --> 02:05:15,956
You are good at make-up,

1632
02:05:16,125 --> 02:05:17,325
you can do for me!

1633
02:05:18,291 --> 02:05:19,751
I will lower my head!

1634
02:05:20,833 --> 02:05:23,793
It's possible, it just a short way!

1635
02:05:27,708 --> 02:05:28,498
You can.

1636
02:05:29,166 --> 02:05:29,866
It's possible.

1637
02:06:38,125 --> 02:06:40,365
You know what could happen?

1638
02:06:41,208 --> 02:06:42,828
Yes, yes, I know.

1639
02:06:44,166 --> 02:06:47,326
I can do what Father Ingleman tell me.

1640
02:06:49,666 --> 02:06:50,366
Amazing.

1641
02:06:52,041 --> 02:06:53,171
I think I hear

1642
02:06:53,333 --> 02:06:55,293
what the Father is saying right now.

1643
02:06:55,750 --> 02:06:56,330
Yes?

1644
02:06:56,708 --> 02:06:57,248
Yeah.

1645
02:06:58,041 --> 02:06:59,211
What he saying?

1646
02:06:59,583 --> 02:07:00,623
I think he's saying...

1647
02:07:02,333 --> 02:07:03,753
that you've done an incredible...

1648
02:07:04,666 --> 02:07:08,366
an incredible job, taking care of the girls.

1649
02:07:08,875 --> 02:07:10,995
And that you're good, so good.

1650
02:07:13,708 --> 02:07:16,078
And I think he's also asking...

1651
02:07:18,041 --> 02:07:20,331
what the hell are you doing...

1652
02:07:20,500 --> 02:07:22,920
with that awful wig on your head?

1653
02:07:44,625 --> 02:07:47,075
This was the last time I saw George Chen.

1654
02:07:47,583 --> 02:07:50,043
When he was six years old,

1655
02:07:50,500 --> 02:07:51,830
and almost died of starvation,

1656
02:07:52,125 --> 02:07:53,575
Father Ingleman saved him.

1657
02:07:54,208 --> 02:07:56,328
He rang the church bell, swept the floor,

1658
02:07:56,583 --> 02:07:58,003
and worked in the kitchen.

1659
02:07:58,416 --> 02:07:59,416
We used to laugh at him,

1660
02:07:59,666 --> 02:08:02,326
whenever he spoke in English

1661
02:08:02,500 --> 02:08:03,750
or in Nanking dialect.

1662
02:08:16,458 --> 02:08:17,828
You know that,

1663
02:08:18,708 --> 02:08:20,168
you can't really go there.

1664
02:08:20,875 --> 02:08:23,745
You gotta escape somehow before you get there.

1665
02:08:24,291 --> 02:08:27,831
You gotta jump from the car or the truck or whatever.

1666
02:08:28,500 --> 02:08:29,790
You wait until it slows down,

1667
02:08:29,958 --> 02:08:30,998
goes around the corner,

1668
02:08:31,166 --> 02:08:32,166
that's when you jump.

1669
02:08:32,583 --> 02:08:34,293
No, I'm no jumping.

1670
02:08:34,666 --> 02:08:35,456
Don't teach me.

1671
02:08:35,625 --> 02:08:36,285
Why not?

1672
02:08:36,916 --> 02:08:37,826
If I jump,

1673
02:08:39,291 --> 02:08:41,171
Japanese will find out.

1674
02:08:42,000 --> 02:08:43,210
I will go all the way,

1675
02:08:43,791 --> 02:08:47,621
give you more time. You and the girls

1676
02:08:48,791 --> 02:08:50,371
get out of the church.

1677
02:09:05,916 --> 02:09:06,746
Hide your weapons well.

1678
02:09:06,916 --> 02:09:07,706
Don't let the Japanese see.

1679
02:09:08,125 --> 02:09:08,665
Don't worry,

1680
02:09:08,875 --> 02:09:10,535
at least we will get an eyeball.

1681
02:09:21,208 --> 02:09:22,668
Have you got something as well?

1682
02:09:59,041 --> 02:10:01,501
Following our commander's order,

1683
02:10:01,750 --> 02:10:03,460
I'm here to pick up the students.

1684
02:10:07,291 --> 02:10:09,081
Here is a gift bag from our troops.

1685
02:10:10,083 --> 02:10:11,213
Please accept it.

1686
02:10:35,041 --> 02:10:36,121
What are you doing here?

1687
02:10:37,250 --> 02:10:38,040
Mr. Kato.

1688
02:10:39,291 --> 02:10:42,501
Have you spoken with Colonel Hasegawa?

1689
02:10:43,041 --> 02:10:44,171
My daughter,

1690
02:10:44,416 --> 02:10:47,246
she doesn't have to go, right?

1691
02:10:48,000 --> 02:10:49,420
The order is from the chief commander.

1692
02:10:49,875 --> 02:10:51,825
Even Colonel Hasegawa can't interfere.

1693
02:10:52,375 --> 02:10:53,245
Get out.

1694
02:10:53,958 --> 02:10:54,668
Mr. Kato.

1695
02:10:55,125 --> 02:10:56,575
But you promised to help.

1696
02:10:56,750 --> 02:10:57,420
Shut up!

1697
02:10:59,250 --> 02:11:01,120
The chief commander is in charge.

1698
02:11:01,458 --> 02:11:01,998
Look,

1699
02:11:02,833 --> 02:11:04,123
he sent troops just for this.

1700
02:11:04,708 --> 02:11:06,248
We can't do anything.

1701
02:11:07,791 --> 02:11:09,331
But we had a deal.

1702
02:11:10,208 --> 02:11:13,458
I have given you all of my valuables.

1703
02:11:13,833 --> 02:11:14,503
Mr. Kato.

1704
02:11:14,875 --> 02:11:16,615
Please, you promised!

1705
02:11:16,791 --> 02:11:18,791
When did I take your things?

1706
02:11:23,291 --> 02:11:25,961
That was for our military expenses.

1707
02:11:30,625 --> 02:11:31,705
Then I'm begging you,

1708
02:11:32,291 --> 02:11:33,791
please allow me to see

1709
02:11:34,291 --> 02:11:35,961
my daughter one last time.

1710
02:13:18,291 --> 02:13:20,921
I'm not a student. I won't go!

1711
02:13:21,083 --> 02:13:23,003
I won't go!

1712
02:13:23,375 --> 02:13:24,785
I'm not a student!

1713
02:13:26,916 --> 02:13:28,246
Isn't that your daughter?

1714
02:13:28,416 --> 02:13:29,246
What is she saying?

1715
02:13:29,750 --> 02:13:30,830
Why is she shouting?

1716
02:13:31,541 --> 02:13:35,541
I'm not a student!

1717
02:13:40,208 --> 02:13:42,788
I won't go!

1718
02:13:50,750 --> 02:13:52,540
Be gentle with her, she's just a girl.

1719
02:14:07,083 --> 02:14:08,623
You've seen your daughter.

1720
02:14:59,666 --> 02:15:00,166
Let's go.

1721
02:15:00,500 --> 02:15:01,170
Come on.

1722
02:15:19,916 --> 02:15:20,536
Shu.

1723
02:15:21,875 --> 02:15:22,615
Come here.

1724
02:15:25,291 --> 02:15:27,831
Your father is a good man.

1725
02:15:28,041 --> 02:15:28,871
We could never have done this...

1726
02:15:29,041 --> 02:15:30,041
without your father.

1727
02:15:30,458 --> 02:15:31,418
He's a good man.

1728
02:15:37,958 --> 02:15:38,918
Watch your legs.

1729
02:17:25,708 --> 02:17:26,618
John told me that his biggest regret

1730
02:17:27,291 --> 02:17:27,921
was that, because

1731
02:17:28,083 --> 02:17:29,963
we had to get out as quickly as possible,

1732
02:17:30,375 --> 02:17:32,325
he couldn't give my father a proper burial.

1733
02:18:02,125 --> 02:18:05,535
Is this good for me to go through?

1734
02:18:08,833 --> 02:18:09,793
What's on the truck?

1735
02:18:14,541 --> 02:18:16,121
Empty wine cases, but...

1736
02:18:16,708 --> 02:18:18,288
four of them are full. They are...

1737
02:18:18,458 --> 02:18:20,118
very good, very good.

1738
02:18:20,291 --> 02:18:20,871
Here.

1739
02:18:21,708 --> 02:18:22,998
You see, vintage.

1740
02:18:24,541 --> 02:18:25,501
If you would like some.

1741
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:27,750
Open it.

1742
02:18:33,625 --> 02:18:34,285
These.

1743
02:18:35,708 --> 02:18:36,208
Take.

1744
02:19:18,250 --> 02:19:19,540
Until this day

1745
02:19:19,750 --> 02:19:21,670
I still don't know what happened

1746
02:19:21,833 --> 02:19:23,043
to the women of the Qin Huai River.

1747
02:19:23,625 --> 02:19:25,915
I never learned all of their names,

1748
02:19:26,750 --> 02:19:28,040
and never saw them

1749
02:19:28,208 --> 02:19:29,708
being taken away by the Japanese.

1750
02:19:30,083 --> 02:19:31,873
So, I always imagine...

1751
02:19:32,416 --> 02:19:33,246
I imagine myself standing

1752
02:19:33,416 --> 02:19:34,826
by the large round window,

1753
02:19:35,208 --> 02:19:36,618
watching them walk in once again.
