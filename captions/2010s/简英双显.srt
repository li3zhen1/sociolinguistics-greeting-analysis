杀人之前是不是先考虑下后果
Perhaps we should consider the consequences first.

295
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:44,998
后果就是宰了两个日本子

毒物值多少钱
How much is poison worth?

吹牛到最后也不就是人气
You got nothin' but two farts in you.

311
00:18:31,264 --> 00:18:33,027
就这个东西的解药方子
I could take this cure

312
00:18:33,198 --> 00:18:35,098
把它鼓捣鼓捣上了锣鼓巷
and take it down to Drum & Bell Alley,

313
00:18:35,264 --> 00:18:37,824
那怎么的不得卖出来一千个大洋
and I could sell it for at least 1,000 silvers!

314
00:18:37,964 --> 00:18:38,931

00:18:43,964 --> 00:18:45,365
要按照这么来说
Going off that,

319
00:18:45,365 --> 00:18:48,164
我找道上的朋友最起码能翻个番
I can take this to a guy I know,

320
00:18:48,164 --> 00:18:50,257
那就是一万大洋
and we could get 10,000!

321
00:18:51,665 --> 00:18:52,689
一万
10,000!

322
00:19:01,565 --> 00:19:02,122
那什么
Right, so,

323
00:19:02,998 --> 00:19:04,795
爷可不是为了钱
it's not about the money,

324
00:19:05,264 --> 00:19:08,995
爷是为了救天下的黎民百姓
I'm doing this to spare my people suffering!

325
00:19:10,031 --> 00:19:10,963
对对对  那是那是啊
There you go, there you go...

326
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,892
想一块儿去了
We're thinking along the same lines!

327
00:19:15,765 --> 00:19:16,663
来  这边说这边说这边说
Come on, let's talk over here. Over here.

来来来来来
Come along, come along.

329
00:19:18,598 --> 00:19:18,897
上哪儿上哪儿
Where did they go?!

330
00:19:18,897 --> 00:19:20,064
我们到外边说啊
Let's talk outside.

331
00:19:20,064 --> 00:19:20,598
等等  等等
Wait! Wait!

332
00:19:20,598 --> 00:19:22,623
来来来  过来  这边说啊
Come on... over here. Over here.

333
00:19:23,264 --> 00:19:23,964
二流子
Scoundrel,

334
00:19:23,964 --> 00:19:25,556
你过来干嘛  你不要走吗
why are you here? Weren't you leaving?

335
00:19:25,765 --> 00:19:26,288
走干嘛
Why leave?

336
00:19:27,031 --> 00:19:28,259
真是倒霉
Damn! The shame burns me.

337
00:19:28,631 --> 00:19:30,155
落到这样几个无知混蛋手里
That we are in the hands of these ignorant fools

338
00:19:30,897 --> 00:19:34,196
都怪大佐  我说要坐火车的
is all your fault, sir! I said we should take the train!

339
00:19:35,131 --> 00:19:35,998
那我得要六十
Then I want 60%!

340
00:19:35,998 --> 00:19:36,965
对不起
I'm sorry.

341
00:19:37,198 --> 00:19:38,859
就你还要六
Sure you want 60%!

342
00:19:39,732 --> 00:19:41,131
我问问你  就算我给你六
But even if you get your 60%,

343
00:19:41,131 --> 00:19:41,732
你要再说老子
if you call me a turtle again

344
00:19:41,732 --> 00:19:42,130
你有这个命花
you'll pay with your life!

345
00:19:42,198 --> 00:19:44,257
老子带着太君去自首
When I tell them to seppuku

346
00:19:44,732 --> 00:19:45,824
就你个首
I'll seppuku you myself!

347
00:19:49,765 --> 00:19:50,857
就这么定
This is our deal:

348
00:19:52,198 --> 00:19:53,165
三三三
a third, a third, a third.

349
00:19:53,598 --> 00:19:54,565
一人一份
Equal shares for each.

350
00:20:04,298 --> 00:20:06,528
支那人真无耻
Shinajin are shameless fools!

351
00:20:07,732 --> 00:20:08,331
我们是两个人
My wife and I are two,

352
00:20:08,331 --> 00:20:09,765
所以我们要分一半
so we want half.

353
00:20:09,765 --> 00:20:10,831
真不要脸了你
The gall on you!

354
00:20:10,831 --> 00:20:11,231
你怎么不说你全你给放走的
Why don't you say you wanted to let them go?!

355
00:20:11,231 --> 00:20:12,864
料理店可是我的
The restaurant is mine!

356
00:20:12,864 --> 00:20:13,698
人是我带来的
But I brought them here!

357
00:20:13,698 --> 00:20:14,098
你闭嘴
Shut up!

358
00:20:14,098 --> 00:20:15,031
白给你吃白给你住白给你
I gave you food and a bed for nothing!

359
00:20:15,031 --> 00:20:15,931
想要我的
You want my share?

360
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:16,897
我跟你说
Listen here, son...

361
00:20:16,897 --> 00:20:17,625
闭嘴
Shut up!

362
00:20:18,198 --> 00:20:19,264
行行行  可别跟我聊这些
Don't talk to me about this, I can't even

363
00:20:19,264 --> 00:20:19,998
气死你气死你气死你
I hope the anger tears you apart.

364
00:20:19,998 --> 00:20:20,726
出来就跟我没关系
You have nothing to do with me.

365
00:20:21,565 --> 00:20:23,226
闭嘴
Shut the motherlover up!

366
00:20:26,998 --> 00:20:28,090
你们公母俩
You two each

367
00:20:28,565 --> 00:20:29,224
得个四
get a fourth.

368
00:20:29,964 --> 00:20:30,931
你我二人
We two 

369
00:20:30,931 --> 00:20:32,193
一人一个三
each get a third.

370
00:20:32,797 --> 00:20:33,923
既然要分
If we have to split it,

371
00:20:34,565 --> 00:20:35,964
就都别亏着了
let's do this fair and square-like!

372
00:20:52,131 --> 00:20:55,164
升堂
Court is in session!

373
00:20:55,164 --> 00:20:59,100
武威
Rise all!

374
00:20:59,998 --> 00:21:00,521
对不啦
Is that right?

375
00:21:01,531 --> 00:21:02,725
威武
All rise!

376
00:21:02,864 --> 00:21:04,422
威武
All rise!

377
00:21:04,764 --> 00:21:05,788
你可知罪
You know what you did.

378
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:07,665
个小日本子
You kimonos...

379
00:21:07,897 --> 00:21:08,631
杀我们人
you killed our people,

380
00:21:08,631 --> 00:21:09,198
糟蹋我们姑娘
you raped our women,

381
00:21:09,198 --> 00:21:09,964
还不知足
but that's not enough?

382
00:21:09,964 --> 00:21:11,124
还要放毒害我们
Now you want to poison us?

383
00:21:11,498 --> 00:21:12,731
我咒你们生的孩子
I curse your children!

384
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:13,797
一辈儿比一辈儿矬
May each be more inbred than the next!

385
00:21:13,797 --> 00:21:15,196
一个一个都是罗圈腿
May their legs ever be of differing sizes!

386
00:21:16,565 --> 00:21:17,665
给我照实了翻
Translate that faithfully!

387
00:21:17,665 --> 00:21:18,654
一字儿不落啊
Every word!

388
00:21:19,731 --> 00:21:20,789
太君
Sir...

389
00:21:20,897 --> 00:21:21,488
他
he...

390
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:23,029
反对日本
is against Japan.

391
00:21:27,764 --> 00:21:28,662
怎么茬
Excuse me?

392
00:21:29,797 --> 00:21:30,491
完了
That's it?

393
00:21:31,764 --> 00:21:32,897
我这儿得吧得吧说这么多
How did I just say all that,

394
00:21:32,897 --> 00:21:34,159
你怎么两句话完事儿了
and you said it in two lines?

395
00:21:34,465 --> 00:21:36,524
日本话嘛  言简意赅呀
Japanese is deep and efficient.

396
00:21:36,864 --> 00:21:39,094
给我往严重里说
Translate the whole thing!

397
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:40,793
蠢货
Fool!

398
00:21:41,465 --> 00:21:44,059
虎烈拉早就该用在你们身上
We should have used cholera on you ages ago!

399
00:21:44,864 --> 00:21:47,697
让你们所有支那狗全死光
We should have killed every one of you shinajin!

400
00:21:47,897 --> 00:21:48,795
畜生
Animals!

401
00:21:49,498 --> 00:21:50,658
畜生
Animals!

402
00:21:51,964 --> 00:21:52,794
看来
It appears 

403
00:21:53,031 --> 00:21:54,760
这解药的方子
you don't intend

404
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,797
你是不打算跟这儿说了
to give us the cure today.

405
00:21:57,565 --> 00:21:58,031
是吧
Is that so?

406
00:21:58,998 --> 00:21:59,623
行
Very well!

407
00:22:00,164 --> 00:22:00,994
伺候着
Oblige him!

408
00:22:02,897 --> 00:22:04,592
这种无赖的手法
These humiliating techniques

409
00:22:04,697 --> 00:22:07,131
只会对你们支那人才有用
only work on scum like you shinajin!

410
00:22:07,465 --> 00:22:08,056
来吧
Bring it on!

411
00:22:08,231 --> 00:22:09,163
来吧
Bring it on!

412
00:22:21,864 --> 00:22:24,833
有朝一日时运到
The time had come to draw the sword

413
00:22:24,964 --> 00:22:29,458
拔剑要斩海底蛟
and slay the vile sea-dragon!

414
00:22:37,164 --> 00:22:38,995
把那瓶最高的给我
Give me the tallest bottle.

415
00:22:40,664 --> 00:22:41,426
对了
Right.

416
00:22:41,864 --> 00:22:42,888
半步颠
Essence of Divine Bouyancy

417
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:49,765
你这个小胡子男人
You small-moustached fool!

418
00:23:01,630 --> 00:23:03,689
你们到底想干什么的
How dare you fools do this!

419
00:23:04,998 --> 00:23:06,590
这样侮辱日本军人
Humiliating a Japanese officer

420
00:23:07,098 --> 00:23:09,191
一定会死上十次的
will earn you ten deaths!

421
00:23:10,964 --> 00:23:12,932
快放开我混蛋
Let me go, you perverted fools!

422
00:23:16,598 --> 00:23:17,428
“咚”
THWACK!

423
00:23:20,964 --> 00:23:21,589
“太君，加油”
Cheer up, sir!

424
00:23:21,664 --> 00:23:22,494
来吧
Bring it on!

425
00:23:23,198 --> 00:23:24,460
情绪
And... smile!

426
00:23:25,797 --> 00:23:26,991
混蛋
Fools!

427
00:23:27,597 --> 00:23:28,757
来吧
Bring it on!

428
00:23:32,697 --> 00:23:33,823
来吧
Bring it on!

429
00:23:35,597 --> 00:23:36,825
来吧
Bring it on!

430
00:23:38,864 --> 00:23:40,126
笨蛋  笨蛋
Idiot! Idiot!

431
00:23:59,131 --> 00:24:03,693
5小时前
5 HOURS AGO

432
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:36,654
笨蛋  笨蛋
Idiot! Idiot!

433
00:24:37,164 --> 00:24:39,164
胡说  该怎么说来着
Watch your mouth. Now what's your line?

434
00:24:39,164 --> 00:24:40,631
来了  来了
They're coming! They're coming!

435
00:25:05,031 --> 00:25:06,498
来了  来了
They're coming! They're coming!

436
00:25:25,831 --> 00:25:26,525
来了
They're coming.

437
00:26:12,831 --> 00:26:13,923
计划发送完毕
I've just finished sending our plan.

438
00:26:13,998 --> 00:26:15,522
接到最新的命令
We received new orders.

439
00:26:16,031 --> 00:26:18,090
必须要在三天之内拿到疫苗
We need to get the vaccine in three days.

440
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:19,790
现在整个华北地区
There are a million infected

441
00:26:20,031 --> 00:26:21,862
已经有上百万人感染了
in the northeast,

442
00:26:22,031 --> 00:26:23,931
晋察冀边区也开始有人感染
and cases appearing along the central periphery.

443
00:26:24,131 --> 00:26:24,927
三天
Three days?

444
00:26:25,697 --> 00:26:27,130
依我们对日本人的了解
Based on what we know

445
00:26:27,231 --> 00:26:28,264
他们的顽强程度
about the Japanese,

446
00:26:28,264 --> 00:26:30,061
跟缜密程度是可以想像
and how tenacious and secretive they are,

447
00:26:30,264 --> 00:26:31,630
在短时间之内
in that short a time,

448
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,791
常规审讯肯定不会奏效
ordinary interrogation won't be effective.

449
00:26:33,998 --> 00:26:34,797
我提议啊
I propose 

450
00:26:34,797 --> 00:26:35,923
还是按照我的方法来
that we stick to my plan.

451
00:26:36,064 --> 00:26:37,759
这肯定是一台好戏
It will definitely be a good show.

452
00:26:41,731 --> 00:26:43,665
好戏是需要票房的
Good shows need to sell tickets.

453
00:26:44,231 --> 00:26:45,630
嘛呢
What in the name of...

454
00:26:46,664 --> 00:26:48,996
咱们得为几百万人的性命负责任
We're responsible for millions of lives.

455
00:26:49,897 --> 00:26:51,231
万一要是演砸了
What if we blow the part?

456
00:26:51,231 --> 00:26:52,596
可就是大事
That would be very bad.

457
00:26:52,697 --> 00:26:53,998
正因为这是关系到
Precisely because millions of

458
00:26:53,998 --> 00:26:55,630
几百万人性命的事
lives rest on our success or failure,

459
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:57,461
所以我们才不能孤注一掷
we need more than one plan.

460
00:26:57,697 --> 00:26:58,994
不让这些搞研究的人
If we don't make these researchers

461
00:26:59,098 --> 00:26:59,831
放松警惕
let down their guard

462
00:26:59,831 --> 00:27:01,560
我们一点机会都没有
we don't stand a chance at all.

463
00:27:01,797 --> 00:27:02,821
我们是同行
I'm a scientist too.

464
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:03,794
这点我最了解
I know better than anyone.

465
00:27:03,964 --> 00:27:06,125
我们最擅长的就是按逻辑对攻
We will stalemate each other with logic.

466
00:27:06,697 --> 00:27:07,630
我同意
I agree.

467
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:09,621
对付书呆子  就不能按套路出牌
Cliches never work against scholars.

468
00:27:09,998 --> 00:27:10,964
没听说过吗
Have you ever heard

469
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:12,056
九段围棋高手
that Level 9 go players

470
00:27:12,497 --> 00:27:14,192
被街边不会下棋的人给赢了
sometimes lose to new players?

471
00:27:14,597 --> 00:27:15,461
为什么呀
Do you know why?

472
00:27:15,597 --> 00:27:16,928
没按照他的规矩来呀
They don't play by familiar strategies.

473
00:27:17,198 --> 00:27:19,098
咱们就不按照规矩呀胡来
If we break the rules, if we confuse them,

474
00:27:19,731 --> 00:27:20,998
他们乱了  咱们赢定了
then we're guaranteed to win.

475
00:27:20,998 --> 00:27:21,828
我不同意
I disagree.

476
00:27:22,131 --> 00:27:23,723
日本人要不吃这套怎么办
If they don't buy it, what do we do?

477
00:27:24,131 --> 00:27:24,859
我还是坚持
I still like my plan.

478
00:27:25,098 --> 00:27:26,231
只要抓住日本人
We just have to catch them,

479
00:27:26,231 --> 00:27:27,892
就赶紧把疫苗送到解放区
and get the vaccine to the free zones.

480
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:30,760
送到边区路上至少得两天
It's at least a 2-day journey to the free zones.

481
00:27:31,931 --> 00:27:33,164
时间肯定是来不及
There's not enough time.

482
00:27:33,164 --> 00:27:34,564
可再这样讨论下去
And there will be even less

483
00:27:34,564 --> 00:27:35,895
那就更来不及了
if we keep talking!

484
00:27:38,231 --> 00:27:39,061
客人什么时候到
When do our guests arrive?

485
00:27:39,464 --> 00:27:40,624
情报说是明天
The report says tomorrow.

486
00:27:41,198 --> 00:27:41,994
这样
Right now,

487
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,564
现在正好是全城戒严没有客人
with the city under quarantine, we have no customers,

488
00:27:45,564 --> 00:27:46,758
咱们就利用这个机会
and this is an opportunity.

489
00:27:47,064 --> 00:27:48,597
把他们圈进咱们料理馆
We can trap them here, in the restaurant.

490
00:27:48,597 --> 00:27:49,859
料理馆这么多年的改造
The modifications we've made to the place

491
00:27:50,064 --> 00:27:51,053
正好可以用上
are perfect for this game.

492
00:27:51,164 --> 00:27:52,961
可是我真的不会演
But I can't act!

493
00:27:53,597 --> 00:27:54,864
这么多年面对客人
All these years, in front of customers,

494
00:27:54,864 --> 00:27:56,058
偶尔演一下还行
I could do that performance.

495
00:27:56,731 --> 00:27:57,663
可这三天
But this is three days,

496
00:27:57,797 --> 00:27:59,924
我们每分每秒面对的是敌人
every second in front of the enemy!

497
00:28:00,264 --> 00:28:02,164
万一有什么破绽怎么办
What if we make a mistake?

498
00:28:03,964 --> 00:28:04,931
我说你们怎么都变得
When did you people turn into

499
00:28:04,931 --> 00:28:06,489
跟老头老太太似的
scared old ladies?

500
00:28:06,797 --> 00:28:08,890
这根本就不是在冒险
We aren't taking a risk like this!

501
00:28:09,264 --> 00:28:09,964
把我说的方法
Combining my method

502
00:28:09,964 --> 00:28:11,630
跟正常审讯结合到一块
with the standard interrogation methods

503
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,564
这只是多了一层成功的保障嘛
gives us one more chance of success!

504
00:28:18,731 --> 00:28:19,425
成
Ok.

505
00:28:19,998 --> 00:28:21,989
咱们就相信老二的判断
Then we'll do it your way.

506
00:28:22,731 --> 00:28:24,164
不过这出戏可不好演
But this won't be an easy performance.

507
00:28:24,797 --> 00:28:25,957
要想蒙住日本人
Scaring the Japanese means

508
00:28:26,164 --> 00:28:28,428
咱们必须得演得特别疯狂
we have to be crazier than they are.

509
00:28:29,664 --> 00:28:31,723
把你们的看家本事都亮出来吧
This role will take every skill you have.

510
00:28:32,098 --> 00:28:32,996
服从命令
Those are my orders.

511
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,460
不讨论了
No more discussion.

512
00:28:35,098 --> 00:28:35,894
准备吧
Get ready.

513
00:29:08,931 --> 00:29:09,989
笨蛋  笨蛋
Idiot! Idiot!

514
00:29:16,864 --> 00:29:19,799
第二日
DAY 2

515
00:29:23,764 --> 00:29:24,958
太君
Officer!

516
00:29:28,998 --> 00:29:29,965
我来了
It's me!

517
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,219
他们带的不是疫苗
That's not a vaccine they have,

518
00:30:11,664 --> 00:30:12,756
肯定是原菌液
it's a germ sample.

519
00:30:13,564 --> 00:30:15,064
小笠原瞬间的反应紧张极了
Ogasawara's reaction was pure terror.

520
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:16,691
既然是真的生化专家
So he really is a biologist.

521
00:30:17,031 --> 00:30:19,124
可他们为什么现在带着原菌液
But why were they bringing a cholera sample

522
00:30:19,263 --> 00:30:20,491
来到北平呢
to Peking?

523
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:22,462
日军
The Japanese might

524
00:30:22,564 --> 00:30:24,759
可能察觉到虎烈拉病毒正在变异
have discovered a mutant strain of cholera,

525
00:30:24,931 --> 00:30:26,899
所以需要研制出新的疫苗
so they wanted to research a new vaccine.

526
00:30:27,131 --> 00:30:28,120
来这是做实验的
They could be here for experiments.

527
00:30:28,597 --> 00:30:29,530
那也就是说
So what you're saying

528
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:30,897
我们现在即便拿到了
is even if we get the vaccine,

529
00:30:30,897 --> 00:30:32,694
也只是原来疫苗的配方
it only works on the original strain.

530
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:34,558
变异只是怀疑对吧
But this mutant strain is a theory?

531
00:30:34,864 --> 00:30:35,230
对
Yes.

532
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:36,464
也就是说
So you're saying

533
00:30:36,464 --> 00:30:38,125
现在的疫苗还管用
the original vaccine still works?

534
00:30:39,131 --> 00:30:40,189
那就必须拿下
Then we need to get it.

535
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:42,431
说说下一步
What's the next step?

536
00:30:42,864 --> 00:30:44,627
下一步是厨子的苦肉计
The chef pretends to get hurt.

537
00:30:44,931 --> 00:30:46,956
无论如何要让敌人相信他
We need to gain their trust

538
00:30:47,064 --> 00:30:48,895
这样我们才有更大的机会
before anything else happens.

539
00:30:53,098 --> 00:30:54,156
太君呐
Officer...

540
00:30:55,831 --> 00:30:56,889
喝点水
Have some water.

541
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:58,531
保存点儿体力啊
Preserve your strength!

542
00:30:59,163 --> 00:31:00,994
这帮家伙这么搞下去
If these fellows keep this up,

543
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,697
会出人命了
someone might die!

544
00:31:03,031 --> 00:31:04,998
早知道这帮家伙那么歹毒
If I had known they were so vicious,

545
00:31:04,998 --> 00:31:06,431
我就不要那点钱了
I never would have wanted that money!

546
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:08,689
我跟他们可不是一伙的
I'm not one of them, Officer!

547
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:15,790
你跟哪儿弄的水
Where did you get that water!

548
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:17,563
谁让你喝水了
No water for you!

549
00:31:18,098 --> 00:31:19,030
厨子
Chef...

550
00:31:19,897 --> 00:31:21,023
你说什么是
Tell me what you think

551
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:22,697
民族败类呀
a national disgrace is?

552
00:31:22,697 --> 00:31:24,892
民族败类就是那个汉奸
A national disgrace is a Han traitor!

553
00:31:26,664 --> 00:31:27,221
汉奸
Han traitor?!

554
00:31:27,697 --> 00:31:30,860
汉奸  汉奸  汉奸  汉奸  汉奸
Han traitor?! Han traitor?! Han traitor?!

555
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:33,026
消消气  消消气
Calm down, calm down...

556
00:31:33,697 --> 00:31:34,731
你说什么是汉奸
What's a Han traitor?

557
00:31:34,731 --> 00:31:36,028
汉奸啊
A Han traitor...

558
00:31:37,197 --> 00:31:38,630
就是卖国贼呀
They sell out their country!

559
00:31:38,998 --> 00:31:40,431
卖国贼
They sell out their country!

560
00:31:40,764 --> 00:31:42,857
卖国贼  卖国贼  卖国贼
They sell out they sell out they sell out their country!

561
00:31:43,597 --> 00:31:45,087
卖国  卖国  卖国贼
They sell out they sell out they sell out their country!

562
00:31:46,464 --> 00:31:47,590
卖国贼
They sell out their country!

563
00:31:49,564 --> 00:31:50,155
那你说
So tell me

564
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:51,588
什么是卖国贼呀
what is selling out your country?

565
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:53,224
卖国贼呀
Well, that...

566
00:31:53,764 --> 00:31:54,856
他分好多种哪
there are lots of ways!

567
00:31:57,697 --> 00:31:59,187
打人不打脸的
Hit the body, not the face!

568
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:03,893
老子今天跟你拼命
Let's have at it, then!

569
00:32:19,664 --> 00:32:21,427
哥  原谅你了
Okay, I forgive you.

570
00:32:29,931 --> 00:32:31,865
回头咱们抽丫
We'll get him for that later.

571
00:32:50,998 --> 00:32:51,930
大佐
Colonel,

572
00:32:52,197 --> 00:32:53,596
您一定要坚持住
stay strong, sir.

573
00:32:53,964 --> 00:32:57,058
这群蠢货只会用这样的下流方法
These fools only know how to play with us.

574
00:32:57,864 --> 00:33:00,094
他们根本不懂什么叫死亡
They don't understand death.

575
00:33:00,664 --> 00:33:03,530
他们只能更激励我的斗志
They only provoke me to fight harder!

576
00:33:03,530 --> 00:33:04,588
住嘴
Silence.

577
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,495
仔细观察
Observe them.

578
00:33:07,931 --> 00:33:08,920
这些人
Closely.

579
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:12,464
这不会说话
So it can speak!

580
00:33:12,464 --> 00:33:13,897
我还以为是个哑巴呢
Thought we had us a mutie!

581
00:33:13,897 --> 00:33:15,125
甭废话  吊起来
No more talking! String them up!

582
00:33:16,564 --> 00:33:18,191
你们不要再进行这种愚蠢刑讯了
Stop this foolish torture. Or ten times worse

583
00:33:19,063 --> 00:33:20,724
哪怕再加上十倍
will be done to you.

584
00:33:20,997 --> 00:33:22,726
对我们也不起一点作用
This won't work on us.

585
00:33:22,864 --> 00:33:23,888
你们听着
Now listen,

586
00:33:24,864 --> 00:33:27,799
我们伪装到华北
we came north in disguise

587
00:33:27,997 --> 00:33:29,897
就是为了避免不必要的麻烦
because we wanted to avoid unnecessary trouble.

588
00:33:30,230 --> 00:33:33,597
有很多匪徒在等着我们
We would have been ambushed by bandits.

589
00:33:33,597 --> 00:33:35,097
这些人都不明白
And they wouldn't understand

590
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:35,697
起
Up!

591
00:33:35,697 --> 00:33:36,764
如果我们死了会产生
the terrible consequences

592
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,095
多么可怕的后果
our deaths would cause!

593
00:33:38,597 --> 00:33:39,757
上百万人都会送命
Millions would die!

594
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,497
会有很多日本人死掉
Many would be Japanese,

595
00:33:41,864 --> 00:33:43,593
但死的更多的是你们支那人
but many more would be shinajin like you!

596
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,564
他在这吧啦吧啦的
In all that jibber-jabber,

597
00:33:46,564 --> 00:33:49,158
是不是已经把这人方子都给招了
did he just give away the vaccine?

598
00:33:50,664 --> 00:33:51,028
厨子
Chef!

599
00:33:51,564 --> 00:33:51,996
厨子
Chef!

600
00:33:52,163 --> 00:33:52,822
厨子
Chef!

601
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:53,863
汉奸厨子
Traitor chef!

602
00:33:54,097 --> 00:33:55,860
老子我在这里
I'm up here!

603
00:33:55,997 --> 00:33:57,157
太君没有招
No he did not!

604
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,555
太君很坚强
He's so very strong!

605
00:33:59,697 --> 00:34:02,130
太君说了  他们打扮成商人样子
He said they came north dressed as merchants

606
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:05,122
就是怕你们这帮歹徒不顾大局
because they were afraid of bandits like you!

607
00:34:06,097 --> 00:34:07,792
这臭丫挺的
This son of a pooch!

608
00:34:08,097 --> 00:34:09,962
给我升高了  吊房顶上去
Get them up there! To the roof!

609
00:34:10,197 --> 00:34:11,596
我看这汉奸厨子
Let's see if this traitor chef

610
00:34:11,731 --> 00:34:13,722
还有什么招伺候这俩日本子
can find a way to serve these kimonos then!

611
00:34:22,097 --> 00:34:24,190
还真是在严刑拷打呀
My, but it's so brutal!

612
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:28,088
看来是在问密码
They're asking for the combination.

613
00:34:29,163 --> 00:34:29,925
哥
Brother,

614
00:34:30,197 --> 00:34:31,130
你恁么确定
how do you know

615
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:33,030
那人带密码的蓝箱子里
that case with the combination lock

616
00:34:33,163 --> 00:34:34,187
有宝贝呀
has loot in it?

617
00:34:35,230 --> 00:34:37,130
这又是啥鳖孙玩意啊
What the turtle's son is this?

618
00:34:40,664 --> 00:34:44,122
这里边肯定装的是值大钱的东西
Oh, they got themselves a fancy stash in there.

619
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:46,930
那咱为嘛不进去把那箱子抢出来
How come we don't go in and take it?

620
00:34:47,030 --> 00:34:48,019
立个大功
We'll solve a case.

621
00:34:48,831 --> 00:34:51,994
没准还能成为侦缉队的正规队员
They might even make us full-time detectives!

622
00:34:52,564 --> 00:34:53,588
鳖孙  鳖孙
Turtleson! Turtleson!

623
00:34:54,197 --> 00:34:55,061
还侦缉队
Detectives?!

624
00:34:55,464 --> 00:34:56,163
有了宝贝
If we sell that loot,

625
00:34:56,163 --> 00:34:58,723
买它个日本联队给咱当保镖
we can hire Japanese detectives as bodyguards!

626
00:34:59,963 --> 00:35:01,658
老大真有远见
Such vision, boss!

627
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:03,963
今天晚上
Tonight,

628
00:35:03,963 --> 00:35:05,487
穿上夜行服带上家伙
come back dressed in black, with knives,

629
00:35:05,664 --> 00:35:08,724
咱给他来个神兵天降
and we'll go in there and take our baby!

630
00:35:10,997 --> 00:35:11,986
太君
Officer!

631
00:35:13,497 --> 00:35:14,555
你看这啥
Look what I got!

632
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:16,629
渴不
Thirsty?

633
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:17,792
渴不
Thirsty?

634
00:35:18,497 --> 00:35:19,623
两天没喝水了
You've been 2 days with no water!

635
00:35:19,831 --> 00:35:20,627
来来来
Hey! Hey!

636
00:35:20,963 --> 00:35:22,897
让他们发现  就麻烦了
If they see me, it's trouble!

637
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,162
快整两口
Quick, drink some!

638
00:35:26,197 --> 00:35:27,095
太君
Officer!

639
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:33,063
摔死丫
Drop him!

640
00:35:38,063 --> 00:35:38,927
妈呀
Oh my!

641
00:35:47,863 --> 00:35:49,163
还真没摔死
He's still not dead!

642
00:35:49,163 --> 00:35:50,562
起来吧你
Get up!

643
00:35:51,097 --> 00:35:51,893
疼
Ow!

644
00:35:52,097 --> 00:35:53,731
像你这么不讲道义
Where's your sense of justice?

645
00:35:53,731 --> 00:35:55,062
不讲规矩的玩意儿
Do the rules not apply to you?

646
00:35:55,263 --> 00:35:56,630
我说要不然直接就给他
What do you say if I just saw

647
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,756
咔嚓了得了
your head off!

648
00:35:58,063 --> 00:35:58,896
住着
Don't move!

649
00:35:58,896 --> 00:36:00,764
其实我这么做也是为大家好
I was doing it for your own good!

650
00:36:00,764 --> 00:36:02,925
太君高兴了也能给大家留条活路
If they're pleased with us, they might spare us!

651
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:05,655
汉奸婆子你给我听好喽
Traitor's wife, listen up!

652
00:36:05,896 --> 00:36:08,197
你二人犯的是叛国罪
You two have betrayed your country!

653
00:36:08,197 --> 00:36:10,062
这要是拉大街上去
If word of this got out on the street,

654
00:36:10,197 --> 00:36:12,631
够枪毙你们十回
your neighbors would kill you on sight!

655
00:36:12,896 --> 00:36:13,920
报应啊
It's karma!

656
00:36:15,530 --> 00:36:16,497
报应
Karma!

657
00:36:17,597 --> 00:36:19,087
老子这条腿都摔坏了
My leg was shattered in the fall.

658
00:36:19,497 --> 00:36:20,589
这就是报应
That's my punishment!

659
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:22,656
好了我知道错了
I won't do it again.

660
00:36:22,797 --> 00:36:23,821
晚了
Too late!

661
00:36:24,263 --> 00:36:25,530
像这种祸害
Criminals like this

662
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:27,263
我跟你说就不能留根儿
have to be cut off at the root.

663
00:36:27,263 --> 00:36:29,959
要不然  直接给他来个斩草除根
You want I should just cut off his root?

664
00:36:31,097 --> 00:36:33,530
与子孙无关
His children are innocent!

665
00:36:33,530 --> 00:36:33,996
这个样
Alright,

666
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:34,994
听我的
then how about,

667
00:36:35,796 --> 00:36:38,458
死罪可免  活罪难饶
we won't kill him, but we can't let it go,

668
00:36:42,664 --> 00:36:44,564
给他切几个指头豆怎么样
so I'll cut off a few toes as punishment!

669
00:36:44,564 --> 00:36:45,155
等等
Wait!

670
00:36:45,697 --> 00:36:49,133
老子那些钱全是你们的了
You can have my share of the money!

671
00:36:49,464 --> 00:36:50,726
那成啊
That works!

672
00:36:50,863 --> 00:36:52,660
那我老婆的那份
But my wife still wants her share!

673
00:36:52,896 --> 00:36:54,163
还是要的哦
I still want that.

674
00:36:54,163 --> 00:36:56,563
下刀
Cut his toes off!

675
00:37:04,697 --> 00:37:05,721
你怎么变红了
Why did you turn red?

676
00:37:05,830 --> 00:37:07,695
那个小胡子男人给我打了药
The tiny-moustached man gave me a shot.

677
00:37:07,796 --> 00:37:08,820
嗓子都发不出声了
My throat's so sore I can't shout.

678
00:37:09,063 --> 00:37:11,197
这样的屈辱还不如让我剖腹吧
I would rather seppuku than bear these insults!

679
00:37:11,197 --> 00:37:12,027
安静下来
Quiet!

680
00:37:12,163 --> 00:37:13,824
必须想办法出去
We need to think of a way out.

681
00:37:14,163 --> 00:37:15,926
部队里的疫情要是不控制住
The epidemic in the army is out of control.

682
00:37:16,664 --> 00:37:17,824
整个战争就会输掉
This could even cost us the war.

683
00:37:17,963 --> 00:37:18,564
忍耐
Bear it!

684
00:37:18,564 --> 00:37:22,762
他们已经知道我们是七三一部队的
They already know we're from Unit 731.

685
00:37:23,097 --> 00:37:25,230
我们杀了那么多支那人
We've killed so many shinajin.

686
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:26,561
他们是不会放过我们的
They won't let us go.

687
00:37:26,664 --> 00:37:27,790
那些都不是人
Those weren't people.

688
00:37:27,963 --> 00:37:29,157
他们只是实验品
They were experimental subjects.

689
00:37:29,263 --> 00:37:30,025
明白
Understood.

690
00:37:30,530 --> 00:37:32,197
随便说一个配方骗他们吧
Just give them a false vaccine.

691
00:37:32,197 --> 00:37:33,630
他们也许会放我们
They may let us go.

692
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:34,790
别小看他们
Don't underestimate them.

693
00:37:34,963 --> 00:37:35,895
没那么简单
They're not that simple.

694
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:37,463
说什么都会杀人灭口
They'll kill us whatever we say.

695
00:37:37,597 --> 00:37:39,792
所以我要想办法脱身
We must find a way to escape.

696
00:37:40,097 --> 00:37:41,997
那应该怎么办
Then what should we do?

697
00:37:41,997 --> 00:37:44,989
支那人最大的弱点就是不团结
The shinajin's biggest weakness is lack of unity.

698
00:37:45,163 --> 00:37:46,460
他们这帮人应该
These people likely...

699
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:47,531
歹徒啊
You monsters!

700
00:37:47,664 --> 00:37:49,030
哥可得急眼了
Now I'm getting mad!

701
00:37:49,030 --> 00:37:50,520
我去你娘的脚
By the saints, my foot!

702
00:37:54,697 --> 00:37:55,789
我的脚啊
My foot!

703
00:37:58,230 --> 00:37:59,128
太君哪
Officers,

704
00:37:59,763 --> 00:38:01,458
没问题  我会放了你
don't worry, I'll get you out.

705
00:38:04,564 --> 00:38:05,531
你听我说
Listen to me.

706
00:38:06,497 --> 00:38:07,191
现在
Right now,

707
00:38:07,963 --> 00:38:10,932
重庆方面  共产党  民间团体
the Chongqing government, the Communists,

708
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:13,824
都想要疫苗配方
and everyone else wants this vaccine.

709
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:14,994
但是
But

710
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:16,664
如果没有我的话
without me,

711
00:38:16,664 --> 00:38:18,154
他们得到了也没有用
they won't be able to make it.

712
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:20,027
所以
So,

713
00:38:20,730 --> 00:38:23,028
如果你真的为帝国着想的话
if you truly wish to serve the Empire,

714
00:38:23,497 --> 00:38:24,088
就把我放了
set me free.

715
00:38:25,097 --> 00:38:27,759
皇军会给你很多的钱
The Imperial Army will give you a lot of money.

716
00:38:27,896 --> 00:38:28,590
怎么样
What do you say?

717
00:38:29,063 --> 00:38:30,724
那太好了
I love money!

718
00:38:32,197 --> 00:38:33,960
再等几天就好了
Just give me a few more days.

719
00:38:35,263 --> 00:38:36,958
还要等几天
Yes, in a few more days

720
00:38:37,197 --> 00:38:38,664
到时候所有人都死了
every one of us will be dead!

721
00:38:38,664 --> 00:38:39,995
是是  是  是
Yes, yes, I know, I know.

722
00:38:49,963 --> 00:38:50,895
太君
Officer,

723
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,293
我老婆
my wife...

724
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,522
他们是不防着的
they haven't tied her up.

725
00:38:55,863 --> 00:39:00,232
让她帮您把配方带出去
Let her take the vaccine out 

726
00:39:00,364 --> 00:39:01,524
然后再给钱
and bring the money back.

727
00:39:02,030 --> 00:39:03,019
行吗
How's that?

728
00:39:04,297 --> 00:39:05,355
小笠原五郎
Ogasawara Goro

729
00:39:05,497 --> 00:39:07,624
毕业于东京帝国大学医学系
Tokyo Imperial University Medical College graduate.

730
00:39:08,063 --> 00:39:09,663
之后直接进入了七三一部队
He was directly recruited by Unit 731,

731
00:39:09,663 --> 00:39:11,995
专心研究霍乱病菌的凑班
where he leads research in weaponized cholera.

732
00:39:12,197 --> 00:39:13,994
不就是个书呆子吗  我来
So he's a geek. He's mine.

733
00:39:14,263 --> 00:39:15,127
我倒要看看
I'd like to see

734
00:39:15,230 --> 00:39:16,288
秀才遇上兵
if a soldier like me

735
00:39:16,397 --> 00:39:18,024
到底能出现什么状况
can outwit a geek like him.

736
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:24,958
记着啊
Remember,

737
00:39:25,097 --> 00:39:26,928
我们第一步的目标不是疫苗
our primary goal isn't the vaccine,

738
00:39:27,297 --> 00:39:28,330
而是无所顾忌
it's to be shameless,

739
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:29,627
什么事都干得出来
like we have no bottom line.

740
00:39:30,230 --> 00:39:31,390
一定要让他们相信
We have to make them believe

741
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:33,122
我们无知无耻无谓
we're ignorant, unprincipled,

742
00:39:33,297 --> 00:39:34,161
加无赖
and have no goals.

743
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:34,955
然后
Then,

744
00:39:35,097 --> 00:39:36,462
让他们把警惕性放松下来
we get them to let their guard down,

745
00:39:37,097 --> 00:39:38,086
寻找机会
and look for our chance.

746
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:29,520
你以为你能骗得了我吗
Do you think you can fool me?

747
00:40:31,163 --> 00:40:32,357
你们都是疯子
You're all insane.

748
00:40:34,030 --> 00:40:35,156
你们到底是什么人
Who are you people?

749
00:40:35,397 --> 00:40:36,330
你误会了
I'm sorry, sir!

750
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:38,890
我和我太太是良民  良民  良民
My wife and I are innocent! Innocent!

751
00:40:41,663 --> 00:40:43,130
还真是上阵父子兵
It's a whole family of traitors!

752
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:44,620
卖国夫妻档啊
A husband-wife traitor act!

753
00:40:45,963 --> 00:40:49,023
今儿晚上得见点血啦
Someone's going to bleed tonight!

754
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:56,957
天皇陛下
Glory to the Empire!

755
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,254
万岁
Bonzai!

756
00:40:59,896 --> 00:41:01,363
怨不得天  怨不得地
Ain't no gods to save you now!

757
00:41:01,497 --> 00:41:03,431
要怨就怨你自己吧
This is what kimonos get!

758
00:41:04,197 --> 00:41:05,186
时辰到
It's time!

759
00:41:07,230 --> 00:41:11,166
开铡
Make the incision!

760
00:41:25,263 --> 00:41:27,128
事情不会像咱们想得那么简单
It won't be as simple as we'd thought.

761
00:41:27,529 --> 00:41:29,258
小笠原是不会轻易交出疫苗的
Ogasawara won't give up the vaccine that easily.

762
00:41:29,364 --> 00:41:30,888
或许我们想复杂了
Or maybe we're making this complicated.

763
00:41:31,097 --> 00:41:32,359
是个人都有极限
Everyone has their limits.

764
00:41:32,629 --> 00:41:34,130
你说咱们是不是还
Maybe we should take 

765
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:36,064
缺点火候应该再加把劲
the intensity up a notch.

766
00:41:37,997 --> 00:41:38,986
准备假铡刀吧
Get fake blood and a blade ready.

767
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:41,389
这时候真见点血  也许管用
Seeing a little blood might move things along.

768
00:41:52,696 --> 00:41:55,529
甲贺派忍者菅井来也
I am Sugai, ninja of the Koga clan!

769
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:06,887
这孙子嘿
This turtleson!

770
00:42:07,297 --> 00:42:08,229
是不是疯了
He's turtling crazy!

771
00:42:10,063 --> 00:42:11,530
我就给他上了点药
I just gave him a little shot!

772
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:14,458
按理说不应该是这个疗效
The medicine shouldn't work that well!

773
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:48,328
别动别动别动
Don't move don't move don't move...

774
00:42:49,097 --> 00:42:50,029
息怒息怒息怒
Calm down! Calm down!

775
00:43:01,130 --> 00:43:04,463
畜生  来吧
Animals! BRING IT ON!!

776
00:43:04,663 --> 00:43:05,595
我亲娘
Oh my!

777
00:43:06,563 --> 00:43:09,225
这个药效确实有点出乎意料
That medicine worked way better than I thought!

778
00:43:12,097 --> 00:43:12,997
混蛋
Fools!

779
00:43:12,997 --> 00:43:15,090
确定出菅井真一的真实身份了吗
Have you confirmed Sugai Shinichi's identity?

780
00:43:17,563 --> 00:43:19,030
这个是昭和十一年
In 1937, in Kansai,

781
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,596
关西地区一个地下组织的
an underground children's organization

782
00:43:20,596 --> 00:43:21,426
童子纹身
marked members like this.

783
00:43:21,663 --> 00:43:23,028
就从这个纹身来看
From the tattoo alone,

784
00:43:23,163 --> 00:43:23,696
这个菅井
we know Sugai

785
00:43:23,696 --> 00:43:25,664
不可能有帝国大学的经历
never went to the Imperial University.

786
00:43:25,997 --> 00:43:27,930
那由此可以确定那个小笠原
And from that, we know this Ogasawara

787
00:43:27,930 --> 00:43:29,496
就是东北七三一细菌部队
is from Unit 731's germ warfare department,

788
00:43:29,496 --> 00:43:31,225
人体实验的参与者
a perpetrator of experiments on humans.

789
00:43:46,463 --> 00:43:48,590
刚才是抓马猴子
They were just trying to catch an orangutang,

790
00:43:49,663 --> 00:43:50,493
现在
and now

791
00:43:51,163 --> 00:43:52,630
咋又出来个日本人了
we got more Japanese down there!

792
00:43:56,363 --> 00:43:57,125
哥
Boss,

793
00:43:57,496 --> 00:43:58,895
他们这干嘛呢
what are they doing?

794
00:43:59,130 --> 00:43:59,596
别闹
Quiet!

795
00:43:59,963 --> 00:44:00,588
我思考思考
I gotta think!

796
00:44:04,163 --> 00:44:05,061
开门
Open up!

797
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:09,392
得了  汉奸厨子
Ok, traitor chef!

798
00:44:09,529 --> 00:44:10,359
起来吧 起来吧
Get up! Get up!

799
00:44:10,529 --> 00:44:11,359
下边有你活了
You got a customer!

800
00:44:12,629 --> 00:44:14,230
老子今天不干活了
I'm off work today!

801
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:15,527
有种你自己去接待了
Why don't you go answer the door?

802
00:44:17,629 --> 00:44:19,426
咱谁跟谁都没仇  对不对
We're all friends here, ain't we?

803
00:44:19,596 --> 00:44:22,360
再者说了  跟钱也没仇  是不是
And we all want the money, right?

804

大哥
Come on.

805

812

因为有两个专家被绑架了

现在封城封得那么厉害
The quarantine is very strict.

819
00:45:08,463 --> 00:45:11,489
从天津来的鱼呀都运不过来了
My suppliers in Tianjin can't get through.

820
00:45:11,629 --> 00:45:14,257
不过到底是河豚啊
But these are blowfish.

821
00:45:18,063 --> 00:45:19,428
可以吃一条吗

（可能要暴露了  准备干掉他们）

河豚已经准备好了

832
00:46:27,130 --> 00:46:29,257
你该不会是不敢吃河豚吧
Don't tell me you're too scared!

833
00:46:31,963 --> 00:46:34,989
（现在动手吗）
(Should we kill them now?)

834
00:46:45,563 --> 00:46:46,359
这个

835
00:46:46,596 --> 00:46:47,654
这个是什么呀
What is this?

836
00:46:48,063 --> 00:46:48,961
这个
This...

837
00:46:49,997 --> 00:46:51,931
河豚鱼肝
is blowfish liver!

838
00:46:52,163 --> 00:46:53,460
剧毒
It's poison!

839
00:47:04,329 --> 00:47:05,730
这也是剧毒的吧
Is this poison too?

840
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:06,560
剧毒
Yes, poison!

841
00:47:06,663 --> 00:47:07,493
试试看看
Let's see how poisonous!

842
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:09,224
别扎别扎别扎
Don't poke it, no...

843
00:47:09,429 --> 00:47:11,192
不要不要  不要
Don't! Don't!

844
00:47:12,463 --> 00:47:13,987
万一真出意外怎么办
What if something happens?

845
00:47:14,196 --> 00:47:15,026
见机行事
We'll play it by ear.

846
00:47:15,296 --> 00:47:16,194
能有什么事
What could happen?

847
00:47:16,463 --> 00:47:18,397
逢山开路  遇水搭桥呗
We'll improvise our way out.

848
00:47:18,963 --> 00:47:19,622
还真别说
And you know what?

849
00:47:19,963 --> 00:47:21,555
这时候要是真出点事
If something does happen at that point,

850
00:47:21,963 --> 00:47:23,487
还真不一定是个坏事
it might not be a bad thing.

851
00:47:27,262 --> 00:47:29,560
（审讯陷入僵局）
(Interrogation is a dead end.)

852
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:32,198
（现在引诱日本人包围我们）
(Have them make the Japanese surround us.)

853
00:47:32,363 --> 00:47:34,160
（促使人质出手）
(The hostages will act.)

854
00:47:39,129 --> 00:47:39,959

(Okay.)

855
00:48:03,763 --> 00:48:05,697
（快写  我争取带出去）

856
00:48:14,963 --> 00:48:16,453
还没摔死丫
You're still alive up there?!

857
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:20,429
混蛋
Fool!

写什么
Write what?

859
00:48:27,496 --> 00:48:31,398
悍匪劫我母女上山寨
Bandits stole my wife and daughter to their lair.

860
00:48:31,997 --> 00:48:34,693
母弱女病实不奈
My wife is weak, daughter sick, they cannot fight.

861
00:48:35,363 --> 00:48:38,560
好汉围观不出手
Heroes look on, but yet none act.

862
00:48:38,696 --> 00:48:42,188
恨无义士今何在
Who are these unjust, hateful warriors?

863
00:48:42,529 --> 00:48:44,429
人间万事无常理
There is no justice is men's affairs.

864
00:48:44,429 --> 00:48:45,453
什么人
Who is this?

865
00:48:46,563 --> 00:48:51,125
谁与子龙论成败
Who will speak with Zilong of victory and defeat?

866
00:48:54,329 --> 00:48:55,353
转过来
Turn around!

867
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:03,563
你喜欢玩儿这个呀
So you know how to use this?

868
00:49:04,162 --> 00:49:05,026
比试比试
Let's see how good you are.

869
00:49:07,396 --> 00:49:08,385
我说
I said,

比试比试呀

你死了
You're dead!

876
00:50:02,496 --> 00:50:03,554
这是什么东西呀
What in tarnation is this?

877
00:50:04,296 --> 00:50:05,627
我们新请过来的花旦
Our new female role actor.

878
00:50:06,496 --> 00:50:08,054
真是太丑了
He's hideous.

879
00:50:08,162 --> 00:50:09,129
戏好啊
But he's good!

880
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:34,156
这帮日本人是假的
I say those Japanese are fake.

881
00:50:34,730 --> 00:50:35,719
蓝箱子
And the case,

882
00:50:36,162 --> 00:50:37,595
他们已经私吞了
they already got it open.

883
00:50:37,763 --> 00:50:39,424
正在喝庆功酒呢
They're celebrating right now.

884
00:50:40,296 --> 00:50:41,957
让我来射他们一箭
Let's drop an arrow in there

885
00:50:42,329 --> 00:50:43,261
我探探底细
and see who's who!

886
00:50:57,329 --> 00:50:58,023
你个鳖孙
You turtle's son!

887
00:50:58,329 --> 00:50:59,596
没话传过去你射啥射
You shot without a letter!

889
00:51:13,329 --> 00:51:13,988
她是谁
Who is she?

890
00:51:16,529 --> 00:51:18,029
太君  我老婆  老婆
Officer, my wife, my wife...

891
00:51:18,029 --> 00:51:18,723
老婆
Your wife?

892
00:51:20,062 --> 00:51:22,030
我们是良民来的
We're innocent, we're good people.

893
00:51:22,396 --> 00:51:24,387
五十岚大尉晓得我们的
Captain Igarashi knows us.

894
00:51:26,463 --> 00:51:29,529
这位是我们店里的头牌花旦
This is our female role actor.

895
00:51:29,529 --> 00:51:31,019
跟太君打个招呼

这是个什么东西
What is going on here?

898
00:52:00,129 --> 00:52:01,153
这是什么
What's this?

899
00:52:03,763 --> 00:52:07,096
离开  不然你们都会死在这里
LEAVE NOW, OR YOU ALL WILL DIE HERE.

900
00:52:09,296 --> 00:52:10,126
大尉
Captain,

901
00:52:10,696 --> 00:52:11,685
时间太晚了
it's getting late.

902
00:52:12,196 --> 00:52:13,529
你别管
So what?

903
00:52:13,529 --> 00:52:14,120
大尉
Captain,

904
00:52:15,596 --> 00:52:16,585
该回去了
we should go.

905
00:52:27,229 --> 00:52:28,025
钱
The money,

906
00:52:28,296 --> 00:52:29,024
忘带了
we forgot.

907
00:52:29,296 --> 00:52:30,524
算我们请客好了
Then it's on the house.

908
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:31,492
不行
No.

909
00:52:31,796 --> 00:52:33,696
钱一定要给
We have to pay you.

910
00:52:35,062 --> 00:52:37,121
老板娘跟我去取
Your wife will come with us to get it.

911
00:52:38,429 --> 00:52:39,953
稍等一下
Wait!

912
00:52:45,563 --> 00:52:46,587
老婆
Honeybun,

913
00:52:48,496 --> 00:52:50,020
外面风大
it's cold outside.

914
00:53:08,262 --> 00:53:09,160
跑了几个
They're running away!

915
00:53:09,296 --> 00:53:10,194
哥  回家
Boss, let's go home!

916
00:53:11,329 --> 00:53:12,159
回啥家
Home my tuchus!

917
00:53:13,329 --> 00:53:14,591
寻宝
Let's get the loot!

918
00:53:23,596 --> 00:53:24,392
你们
Who

919
00:53:25,496 --> 00:53:26,394
到底是
are

920
00:53:27,529 --> 00:53:28,496
什么人
you people?

921
00:53:48,463 --> 00:53:49,725
匪徒挟持  菌液被掠
I'VE BEEN KIDNAPPED, THEY HAVE THE CHOLERA SAMPLE.

922
00:53:49,795 --> 00:53:51,126
攻击慎重  小笠原五郎
ATTACK WITH CAUTION. OGASAWARA GORO.

923
00:53:51,196 --> 00:53:52,458
这么干太冒险了
This is too dangerous!

924
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:53,685
你有多大把握
How do you know this will work?

925
00:53:54,229 --> 00:53:55,253
我的把握是
What I'm sure of

926
00:53:55,329 --> 00:53:56,694
一旦日本人包围我们
is that once the Japanese surround us,

927
00:53:57,062 --> 00:53:58,529
他们一定会通过他们军队
they will use some sort of code

928
00:53:58,529 --> 00:53:59,427
特有的方式
to make Ogasawara transmit

929
00:53:59,563 --> 00:54:02,259
让小笠原传递疫苗元素构成
the formula for the vaccine,

930
00:54:03,029 --> 00:54:05,395
只要传递  我们就有机会截获
and once they do, we can intercept.

931
00:54:05,696 --> 00:54:07,061
这只是你的猜测
That's only a guess.

932
00:54:07,329 --> 00:54:08,626
现在暴露已成事实
That we're exposed is a fact!

933
00:54:09,296 --> 00:54:11,457
万一你这招不管用  怎么办
If this doesn't work, what then?

934
00:54:21,329 --> 00:54:22,159
不行的哥
No, boss,

935
00:54:22,262 --> 00:54:23,296
别让我先下去
don't make me go down there.

936
00:54:23,296 --> 00:54:24,126
下去
Get down there!

937
00:54:24,663 --> 00:54:25,563
你下去
Get down there!

938
00:54:25,563 --> 00:54:26,196
别  别  哥
No, don't! Boss! No!

939
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:26,795
下去
Get down there!

940
00:54:26,795 --> 00:54:28,329
别别  哥  别呀哥
No, don't! Boss! No!

941
00:54:28,329 --> 00:54:29,489
下去吧你
Get down there!

942
00:54:32,029 --> 00:54:32,996
二球
Twoball?

943
00:54:33,262 --> 00:54:34,456
路还好是吧
Was it a pleasant journey?

944
00:54:34,663 --> 00:54:35,391
哥
Boss...

945
00:54:36,363 --> 00:54:37,193
来吧
Coast clear...

946
00:54:39,363 --> 00:54:41,627
这是到目前能想到的最好的方式
That's the best thing I can think of right now.

947
00:54:41,829 --> 00:54:42,557
不然呢
What else is there?

948
00:54:43,429 --> 00:54:44,361
不管怎么说
No matter what,

949
00:54:44,762 --> 00:54:46,627
到手的原液不能再丢掉
we can't lose the original sample again.

950
00:54:47,496 --> 00:54:48,262
现在当务之急
Our first job is 

951
00:54:48,262 --> 00:54:49,661
是马上带着原液和人质
to get the sample and the hostage

952
00:54:49,729 --> 00:54:51,026
迅速撤到解放区
to the free zone.

953
00:54:51,096 --> 00:54:52,063
红英怎么办
What about Hongying?

954
00:54:52,496 --> 00:54:54,225
咱们走了  红英怎么办
If we go, what happens to her?

955
00:54:54,629 --> 00:54:56,392
就算咱们把原液送到解放区
Even if we get the sample to the free zone,

956
00:54:56,695 --> 00:54:57,662
可是没有配方
we don't have a vaccine!

957
00:54:58,096 --> 00:54:59,028
又有什么用
What good is that?

958
00:54:59,496 --> 00:55:01,088
这么好的机会如果耽误了
If we waste the opportunity we have now,

959
00:55:01,262 --> 00:55:02,524
浪费的不只是时间
we're not just wasting time!

960
00:55:03,062 --> 00:55:04,256
还会害死更多的人
Even more people will die!

961
00:55:08,162 --> 00:55:09,094
我认为他说得对
I think he's right.

962
00:55:09,762 --> 00:55:11,195
如果我们带走人质
If we take him away,

963
00:55:11,262 --> 00:55:13,662
小笠原就会知道我们的真实身份
Ogasawara will know who we are.

964
00:55:14,129 --> 00:55:15,062
如果他到死
If he decides

965
00:55:15,062 --> 00:55:16,363
都不肯说一句实话的话
to take his secret to the grave,

966
00:55:16,363 --> 00:55:18,331
我们就一点办法都没有了
there's nothing we can do.

967
00:55:19,296 --> 00:55:22,129
所以只要留下  我们就还有机会

我瞧瞧  拼命
Look at this!

1128
01:06:21,729 --> 01:06:22,787
你看这个
He's in there,

1129
01:06:23,595 --> 01:06:24,892
扔在那里  嘴被堵着
and his mouth is gagged,

1130
01:06:25,195 --> 01:06:26,856
所以说只要看清楚动作就可以了
so you just have to watch his motions.

1131
01:06:27,628 --> 01:06:28,151
明白
Got it!

1132
01:06:28,362 --> 01:06:29,228
来来来来
Hey hey hey hey!

1133
01:06:29,228 --> 01:06:30,595
到手的银子眼看就到手
We almost had the silver,

1134
01:06:30,595 --> 01:06:32,688
你丫想独吞  没门
and you want it for yourself? No way!

1135
01:06:32,829 --> 01:06:34,694
汉奸婆子给我听着
Traitor's wife,

1136
01:06:34,829 --> 01:06:36,160
看你也不是好东西
one look and I knew you were no good!

1137
01:06:36,328 --> 01:06:37,454
你还往哪儿躲
Where do you think you'll hide?

1138
01:06:37,729 --> 01:06:39,261
我看你能躲哪儿去
Let go of me! Let go!

1139
01:06:39,261 --> 01:06:40,528
松开快滚松开快
Let's see where you try to hide!

1140
01:06:40,528 --> 01:06:42,261
爷给你表演表演
Now I'm gonna give you a show!

1141
01:06:42,261 --> 01:06:44,525
要追爷  爷可真跟你玩命
Chase me and I'll show you what for!

1142
01:06:44,628 --> 01:06:46,255
老子跟他拼命了
I'll show him what for!

1143
01:06:47,495 --> 01:06:48,862
今儿个把话给我说清楚喽
You're explaining this to me right now!

1144
01:06:48,862 --> 01:06:50,227
二流子那边堵着他
Scoundrel, go stop him!

1145
01:06:50,929 --> 01:06:51,588
我瞧瞧
I'm going!

1146
01:06:51,695 --> 01:06:53,253
跑  我看你往哪儿跑
There's nowhere you can run!

1147
01:06:54,195 --> 01:06:55,261
快点给捕住她
Pin her down!

1148
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:56,353
跑跑跑跑跑
Try to run! Try to run!

1149
01:06:56,662 --> 01:06:57,458
站着别动啊
Now nobody moves!

1150
01:06:58,462 --> 01:06:59,588
我弄不死你我
You think I won't kill you?

1151
01:07:00,961 --> 01:07:03,295
事情既然已经到了这个地步
Think about your odds, gentlemen!

1152
01:07:03,295 --> 01:07:05,229
不如你们两个投降好了
All you can do now is surrender!

1153
01:07:05,362 --> 01:07:06,693
到时候跟太君商量商量
Tell the Japanese what you did,

1154
01:07:06,895 --> 01:07:08,453
还能够从轻发落
and maybe they'll go easy on you!

1155
01:07:08,662 --> 01:07:09,788
你放屁
My tuchus!

1156
01:07:10,261 --> 01:07:11,660
反正老子是不出去了
I know I ain't leaving!

1157
01:07:11,795 --> 01:07:13,262
就算是小鬼子敢进来
Let 'em try to come in here!

1158
01:07:13,395 --> 01:07:14,293
进来我就拉弦儿
When they get in here,

1159
01:07:14,562 --> 01:07:15,862
拉了弦儿大不了轰一声
I'll pull the string, and boom!

1160
01:07:15,862 --> 01:07:17,921
大家同归于尽  一了百了
We all go up in flames!

1161
01:07:18,662 --> 01:07:19,929
中国人不杀中国人
Chinese don't kill Chinese.

1162
01:07:19,929 --> 01:07:21,897
你也算中国人
You still think you're Chinese?

1163
01:07:22,195 --> 01:07:22,661
二流子
Scoundrel,

1164
01:07:22,762 --> 01:07:23,421
你先下手
you go first!

1165
01:07:23,762 --> 01:07:24,854
手起刀落
Bring your knife down,

1166
01:07:25,228 --> 01:07:26,217
咔嚓一声
we'll hear a wet crack,

1167
01:07:26,295 --> 01:07:28,286
汉奸厨子脑袋就落地了
then the traitor chef's head rolls!

1168
01:07:28,662 --> 01:07:29,526
我看行
Sounds good!

1169
01:07:30,195 --> 01:07:30,628
对了
And then,

1170
01:07:30,628 --> 01:07:31,662
你过会儿也拿枪管
you take your gun barrel,

1171
01:07:31,662 --> 01:07:33,220
直接顶着他天灵盖子上
stick it right up his neck,

1172
01:07:33,328 --> 01:07:34,595
过会儿  叭的一枪
get it on there, pull the trigger,

1173
01:07:34,595 --> 01:07:36,228
一下  天灵盖就给掀开
then blam! His head opens up

1174
01:07:36,228 --> 01:07:37,762
里边脑浆撒成一地
and his brains spill out!

1175
01:07:37,762 --> 01:07:38,528
得嘞
Alright!

1176
01:07:38,528 --> 01:07:39,562
我就汉奸厨子了啊
The traitor chef is mine!

1177
01:07:39,562 --> 01:07:40,562
我就这个汉奸婆子了
The traitor's wife is mine!

1178
01:07:40,562 --> 01:07:41,824
我喊一二三
I'll shout 1, 2, 3...

1179
01:07:42,528 --> 01:07:42,729
来
Here we go...

1180
01:07:42,729 --> 01:07:43,252
一
1...

1181
01:07:43,462 --> 01:07:43,757
二
2...

1182
01:07:43,862 --> 01:07:44,487
三
3...

1183
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:47,526
把老子逼急了
Now you made me mad!

1184
01:07:47,795 --> 01:07:49,795
老子一枪解决你们两个人
Now I'm gonna have to kill you!

1185
01:07:49,795 --> 01:07:52,263
你这辱没祖先的玩意儿
You're an insult to your ancestors!

1186
01:08:01,562 --> 01:08:02,722
看准了
She's in my sights!

1187
01:08:26,328 --> 01:08:26,726
老婆
Honeybun!

1188
01:08:26,961 --> 01:08:27,825
老婆
Honeybun!

1189
01:08:34,894 --> 01:08:35,826
我亲娘
Oh my!

1190
01:08:36,762 --> 01:08:37,922
真闹出人命来了
We really killed somebody!

1191
01:08:39,395 --> 01:08:41,625
你真开枪啊  孙子
You shot your own wife?!

1192
01:08:45,261 --> 01:08:47,252
这回算崴了泥了
Now this is bad!

1193
01:08:47,795 --> 01:08:49,626
两国交战还不斩来使呢
Countries at war don't kill ambassadors!

1194
01:08:50,328 --> 01:08:50,961
咱把人日本人
Now we just killed

1195
01:08:50,961 --> 01:08:52,929
派来送信儿的给杀了
the Japanese messenger.

1196
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:54,853
这不绝了人后路吗
We just cut off our backup plan!

1197
01:08:56,261 --> 01:08:57,853
这倒霉催的我跟你说
This is no good at all!

1198
01:08:57,961 --> 01:08:59,395
就咱这几块料还用这么大阵势
And they got all those guys outside, for us!

1199
01:08:59,395 --> 01:09:01,260
往上一点
Up a little.

1200
01:09:01,662 --> 01:09:02,651
侧放
To the side.

1201
01:09:02,829 --> 01:09:03,887
肯定报复咱
We have to answer that!

1202
01:09:04,328 --> 01:09:05,562
这要是杀进来
If they come in here,

1203
01:09:05,562 --> 01:09:06,927
能有咱好
we'll give 'em a show.

1204
01:09:08,729 --> 01:09:11,254
擎等着死也不是法儿
But waiting for it ain't no way to die!

1205
01:09:12,495 --> 01:09:15,430
得嘞  咱也亮亮家伙
So let's light this sucker up!

1206
01:09:44,195 --> 01:09:47,460
一切就绪，随时准备疫苗配方
PREPARE TO RECEIVE TRANSMISSION OF VACCINE

1207
01:10:39,562 --> 01:10:42,861
请迅速通报疫苗配方
BEGIN TRANSMISSION OF VACCINE FORMULA

1208
01:10:45,528 --> 01:10:46,722
媳妇哎
Honeybun,

1209
01:10:47,228 --> 01:10:48,320
你死得好惨哎
why did you have to die like this?

1210
01:10:48,462 --> 01:10:49,656
死得好哎
She died right!

1211
01:10:49,894 --> 01:10:51,794
回等待会日本子杀进来
Once those kimonos come in here,

1212
01:10:52,362 --> 01:10:53,920
什么辣椒水啊老虎凳啊
they'll have pepper spray, the rack,

1213
01:10:53,995 --> 01:10:55,462
大铁钳子拔指甲
pliers for our fingernails,

1214
01:10:55,462 --> 01:10:56,929
挨个伺候咱们
all that waiting for us!

1215
01:11:03,662 --> 01:11:04,856
有信号了
Receiving signal!

1216
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:06,622
大佐开始传送了

信号接收完毕
Signal received!

1218
01:11:52,195 --> 01:11:55,426
老婆哎  你死得好惨哎
Honeybun, why did you have to die like this?

1219
01:11:57,395 --> 01:11:58,521
怎么样  记住了吗
Well? Did you get it?

1220
01:11:59,928 --> 01:12:00,724
密码本呢
Where's the code book?

1221
01:12:00,995 --> 01:12:01,825
上楼
Upstairs.

1222
01:13:17,627 --> 01:13:18,491
有了
Got it.

1223
01:13:21,462 --> 01:13:22,827
抗体的元素表有了
We have the antibody formula!

1224
01:13:28,928 --> 01:13:29,724
别急
Not yet.

1225
01:13:29,961 --> 01:13:31,553
等我验证完了再说
Celebrate once we know it works.

1226
01:14:32,861 --> 01:14:33,885
将军阁下
General!

1227
01:14:48,428 --> 01:14:49,486
将军阁下
General!

1228
01:14:54,794 --> 01:14:55,761
情况怎么样
What's the situation?

1229
01:14:56,928 --> 01:14:58,156
经过检验
Our test results show

1230
01:14:58,261 --> 01:14:59,285
这个疫苗
this vaccine

1231
01:14:59,527 --> 01:15:00,926
确认无效
is ineffective.

1232
01:15:06,295 --> 01:15:07,523
强攻夺人
Go in and get the man!

1233
01:15:09,462 --> 01:15:10,622
命令敢死队
Tell the strike team

1234
01:15:11,295 --> 01:15:13,286
要把小笠原大佐活着带回来
to bring Ogasawara out alive!

1235
01:15:36,195 --> 01:15:37,628
我们是来感谢你的
We're here to thank you

1236
01:15:38,362 --> 01:15:39,522
顺便跟你道个别
and to say farewell.

1237
01:15:40,961 --> 01:15:42,189
原来如此
So that was your plan.

1238
01:15:43,561 --> 01:15:44,960
没想到你懂中国话啊
I didn't expect you could speak Chinese.

1239
01:15:46,261 --> 01:15:48,627
我没想到的事情显然更多
I think I'm more surprised than you.

1240
01:15:49,728 --> 01:15:50,395
看样子
I suppose

1241
01:15:50,395 --> 01:15:52,260
你们已经破译了疫苗的构成
you already know the vaccine formula.

1242
01:15:52,561 --> 01:15:53,528
一字不落
Every letter.

1243
01:15:54,761 --> 01:15:55,557
但是
But

1244
01:15:56,195 --> 01:15:57,628
那只是一种想法
it's just an idea.

1245
01:15:58,228 --> 01:15:59,217
还需要试验
It needs lab work

1246
01:15:59,561 --> 01:16:01,256
更需要临床证明
and patient testing.

1247
01:16:01,828 --> 01:16:02,760
这屋里
In this room,

1248
01:16:03,261 --> 01:16:05,195
研究细菌学的专家
you're not the

1249
01:16:05,328 --> 01:16:06,693
可不止你一个
only microbiologist.

1250
01:16:09,627 --> 01:16:10,491
想不到
I didn't expect

1251
01:16:12,427 --> 01:16:13,359
支那人里
you shinajin could

1252
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:14,922
也有这么聪明的
be so smart.

1253
01:16:15,427 --> 01:16:16,485
你错了
You're wrong.

1254
01:16:17,228 --> 01:16:18,252
在中国人里
As Chinese people go,

1255
01:16:18,427 --> 01:16:19,223
我们
we, actually,

1256
01:16:19,494 --> 01:16:20,426
算是笨的
are pretty stupid.

1257
01:16:21,694 --> 01:16:22,786
别用枪
No guns!

1258
01:16:23,461 --> 01:16:25,361
安全地把大佐救回来
Bring the colonel back safely.

1259
01:16:28,427 --> 01:16:30,327
天皇陛下万岁
Glory to the Empire! Bonzai!

1260
01:16:58,527 --> 01:16:59,926
千万安全送到
Make sure it arrives safely.

1261
01:17:02,527 --> 01:17:04,256
给老师长带个好
And tell the old professor I said hi.

1262
01:17:15,961 --> 01:17:17,485
让那边抓紧做培养液
Have them get a culture ready,

1263
01:17:17,894 --> 01:17:19,486
再多准备点棉絮
and incubate it on cotton balls.

1264
01:17:20,195 --> 01:17:21,694
等实验结果一出来
Once the experiments prove it works,

1265
01:17:21,694 --> 01:17:24,185
正好赶上风季你们把疫苗随风散出去
it's the windy season, so disperse it aerially,

1266
01:17:24,394 --> 01:17:25,594
能救很多人
and you'll save a lot of people.

1267
01:17:25,594 --> 01:17:27,289
那边条件肯定艰苦
Conditions aren't good in the free zone,

1268
01:17:27,828 --> 01:17:29,489
但好歹能安定下来
but thankfully this is taken care of.

1269
01:17:39,828 --> 01:17:41,420
你以后自己一个人的时候
When you're out there alone,

1270
01:17:44,461 --> 01:17:46,156
肯定还会碰到很多危险
it'll be dangerous,

1271
01:17:48,661 --> 01:17:49,195
千万要小心
so be careful.

1272
01:17:49,195 --> 01:17:50,162
别说了
Don't say that.

1273
01:17:52,794 --> 01:17:54,352
只要你们动作快
If you move fast,

1274
01:17:54,995 --> 01:17:56,485
就不会有事
there won't be any problems.

1275
01:18:12,828 --> 01:18:13,886
你可别
So don't...

1276
01:18:16,761 --> 01:18:18,820
别随便就这么死了
Don't say your goodbyes yet.

1277
01:18:57,327 --> 01:18:59,227
驻屯军部命令
Army command orders: 

1278
01:18:59,995 --> 01:19:01,121
还有最后一个小时
you have one hour!

1279
01:19:01,294 --> 01:19:02,894
如再见不到人质
If the hostages are not released,

1280
01:19:02,894 --> 01:19:03,794
准备抢攻夺人，请大佐阁下尽力自保
WE ARE PREPARING TO RAID THE BUILDING.

1281
01:19:03,794 --> 01:19:05,193
将武力强攻这地方
we will enter the building by force!

1282
01:19:06,260 --> 01:19:08,091
驻屯军部命令
Army command orders:

1283
01:19:08,894 --> 01:19:10,088
还有最后一个小时
you have one hour!

1284

如再见不到人质
If the hostages are not released,

1285
01:19:12,361 --> 01:19:14,352
将武力强攻这地方
we will enter the building by force!

1286
01:19:17,961 --> 01:19:19,792
驻屯军部命令
Army command orders:

1287
01:19:20,294 --> 01:19:21,386
还有最后一个小时
you have one hour!

1288
01:19:21,828 --> 01:19:22,726
如再见不到人质
If the hostages are not released...

1289
01:19:22,861 --> 01:19:24,795
这傻媳妇还真能
This stupid wife ain't so stupid!

1290
01:19:25,961 --> 01:19:27,360
火里边也能出去
She can even get out through fire!

1291
01:19:27,861 --> 01:19:29,761
驻屯军部命令
Army command orders:

1292
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:31,625
还有最后一个小时
you have one hour!

1293
01:19:31,761 --> 01:19:33,626
如再见不到人质
If the hostages are not released,

1294
01:19:33,861 --> 01:19:35,852
将武力强攻这地方
we will enter the building by force!

1295
01:19:50,227 --> 01:19:52,218
疫苗只对原菌液有用
The vaccine works against the original strain.

1296
01:19:53,128 --> 01:19:54,220
对变异菌
Against the mutant strain,

1297
01:19:55,361 --> 01:19:56,885
没有任何效果
it's completely useless.

1298
01:20:01,128 --> 01:20:02,686
我试验了很多次
I repeated the experiment many times.

1299
01:20:04,294 --> 01:20:05,124
根本没用
It doesn't work.

1300
01:20:19,728 --> 01:20:20,956
敢死队  集合
Strike team, attention!

1301
01:20:21,327 --> 01:20:24,353
快  敢死队前进五十米
Quickly! Advance 50 meters!

1302
01:20:24,694 --> 01:20:25,991
成攻击队形
Assume attack positions.

1303
01:20:39,728 --> 01:20:40,956
日本人已经成攻击队形
They're in attack positions.

1304
01:20:41,294 --> 01:20:42,386
我们没有多少时间了
We don't have much time.

1305
01:20:47,294 --> 01:20:48,158
你们说呢
Any thoughts?

1306
01:20:49,327 --> 01:20:50,919
得给红英留点时间
We need to buy Hongying some time.

1307
01:20:52,227 --> 01:20:53,251
不管怎么说
No matter what else,

1308
01:20:53,961 --> 01:20:56,225
她这次回去我们还有一线希望
if she makes it back, we still have some hope.

1309
01:20:57,894 --> 01:20:58,383
干吧
Let's do this!

1310
01:21:37,327 --> 01:21:37,952
一
1,

1311
01:21:38,127 --> 01:21:38,718
二
2,

1312
01:21:38,861 --> 01:21:39,623
三
3!

1313
01:21:52,160 --> 01:21:53,991
一群神经病
A bunch of turtlin' madmen!

1314
01:21:59,427 --> 01:22:00,189
鳖孙
Turtleson!

1315
01:22:01,160 --> 01:22:02,024
鳖孙
Turtleson!

1316
01:22:13,127 --> 01:22:14,617
鳖孙玩意
Turtlin' son of a pooch!

1317
01:22:15,661 --> 01:22:16,889
还会火攻
Trying to kill me with fire?!

1318
01:22:17,794 --> 01:22:18,351
谁
Who was that?

1319
01:22:32,894 --> 01:22:33,918
你这鳖孙
You turtleson!

1320
01:22:36,127 --> 01:22:38,027
鳖孙  别动我宝贝
Turtleson! Don't touch my loot!

1321
01:22:38,027 --> 01:22:38,789
来吧
Bring it on!

1322
01:22:38,995 --> 01:22:39,984
来吧
Bring it on!

1323
01:22:43,394 --> 01:22:44,952
里面发生了爆炸
There was an explosion inside!

1324
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:46,625
大佐恐有危险
The colonel may be in danger!

1325
01:22:46,995 --> 01:22:48,622
我们提前进攻
The attack begins now!

1326
01:22:55,060 --> 01:22:56,960
敢死队  进攻
Strike team, advance!

1327
01:24:23,327 --> 01:24:24,919
里面开枪  部队进攻
Gunfire inside! Soldiers, advance!

1328
01:24:25,427 --> 01:24:27,622
记住将军的命令
Remember the general's orders!

1329
01:24:27,794 --> 01:24:29,819
慎重射击
Fire carefully!

1330
01:24:30,127 --> 01:24:31,719
一定要把大佐救出去
We need the colonel alive!

1331
01:25:58,827 --> 01:26:00,692
他没弹药了  集合
He's out of ammunition! Assemble!

1332
01:26:12,194 --> 01:26:13,058
瞄准
Take aim!

1333
01:26:13,927 --> 01:26:14,859
准备射击
Prepare to fire!

1334
01:26:15,194 --> 01:26:15,819
命令
Orders!

1335
01:26:16,094 --> 01:26:17,618
第一部队前进
Team 1, advance!

1336
01:26:24,227 --> 01:26:25,091
不要动
Don't move!

1337
01:26:36,793 --> 01:26:37,350
前进
Advance!

1338
01:26:38,694 --> 01:26:39,718
围住他们
Surround him!

1339
01:26:46,827 --> 01:26:47,350
前进
Advance!

1340
01:26:50,060 --> 01:26:50,822
停下来
Stop!

1341
01:27:07,027 --> 01:27:09,723
这里有虎烈拉变异菌
This is the mutant cholera!

1342
01:27:10,427 --> 01:27:12,292
攻击这里已经没用了
Continuing the attack is pointless.

1343
01:27:14,927 --> 01:27:15,859
别管他
Ignore him.

1344
01:27:16,127 --> 01:27:16,889
前进
Advance!

1345
01:27:57,793 --> 01:27:59,886
这是真的变异菌液
This is the mutant strain!

1346
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:01,184
赶快撤退
Retreat, now!

1347
01:28:01,760 --> 01:28:02,886
你们会感染的
They'll be infected!

1348
01:28:03,427 --> 01:28:04,792
撤退
Retreat!

1349
01:28:20,693 --> 01:28:21,387
全体后撤
Full retreat!

1350
01:28:22,127 --> 01:28:23,924
怎么了  发生什么了
What's going on? What happened?

1351
01:28:25,060 --> 01:28:27,290
到底怎么回事了  怎么了
What happened in there?

1352
01:28:35,793 --> 01:28:44,758
两小时后
TWO HOURS LATER

1353
01:28:45,194 --> 01:28:46,752
准备攻击
Prepare to fire!

1354
01:28:47,860 --> 01:28:48,986
发射
Fire!

1355
01:29:16,793 --> 01:29:21,059
爆炸前
BEFORE THE EXPLOSION

1356
01:29:59,327 --> 01:30:00,692
其实
You know,

1357
01:30:01,094 --> 01:30:03,119
不需要再做下去了
this is pointless.

1358
01:30:03,361 --> 01:30:06,023
我们都已经感染了致命的病菌
We're infected with a lethal disease.

1359
01:30:07,027 --> 01:30:08,790
马上就会死了的
We're all dead within a few hours.

1360
01:30:09,427 --> 01:30:11,156
配方为什么会无效
Why doesn't the vaccine work?

1361
01:30:11,893 --> 01:30:13,292
细菌是你研制的
You created the germs.

1362
01:30:13,994 --> 01:30:15,393
病菌发生了变异
The germs mutated.

1363
01:30:16,693 --> 01:30:18,627
但是没有相应的对策
We didn't have a plan ready.

1364
01:30:19,793 --> 01:30:21,283
只有一种猜想
I only have an idea

1365
01:30:21,693 --> 01:30:23,160
也许可以抑制
that might cure it.

1366
01:30:23,727 --> 01:30:25,024
反正大家都得死
Given that we're all going to die,

1367
01:30:25,994 --> 01:30:26,892
现在
at this point,

1368
01:30:27,294 --> 01:30:29,694
可不可以说说你的那个猜想
could you tell us about your idea?

1369
01:30:31,127 --> 01:30:33,288
你我的失败已经注定了
You are doomed to failure,

1370
01:30:34,760 --> 01:30:36,318
所以说给你们并无妨
so I suppose there's nothing stopping me.

1371
01:30:37,361 --> 01:30:38,851
但是即便我说了
But even if I do tell you,

1372
01:30:39,260 --> 01:30:40,625
你们也不明白
you wouldn't understand.

1373
01:30:42,327 --> 01:30:43,624
几个月前
Several months ago,

1374
01:30:44,227 --> 01:30:46,661
德国人刚刚合成了一种单晶体
the Germans synthesized a type of monocrystal

1375
01:30:47,260 --> 01:30:49,820
对治疗霍乱有很大的作用
that is very effective in curing cholera.

1376
01:30:50,260 --> 01:30:53,058
但是在东亚因为没有实物
But the substance doesn't exist in Asia,

1377
01:30:53,227 --> 01:30:55,718
听以没有临床试验
so no clinical trials were conducted.

1378
01:30:56,394 --> 01:30:57,793
继续问
Keep asking.

1379
01:30:59,827 --> 01:31:00,851
单晶体
A monocrystal? The substance?

1380
01:31:01,027 --> 01:31:01,891
实物
Salamanderin.

1381
01:31:04,394 --> 01:31:05,759
蝾螈毒素
Salamander toxin.

1382
01:31:10,893 --> 01:31:12,053
你会讲德语吗
You speak German?

1383
01:31:12,693 --> 01:31:14,092
37年我在莱比锡大学
In 1937 I spent two years

1384
01:31:14,227 --> 01:31:15,626
进修了两年医学
at Leipzig studying medicine.

1385
01:31:16,227 --> 01:31:19,719
我的德语比日语好的多
My German is better than my Japanese.

1386
01:31:26,060 --> 01:31:26,890
你们
You know,

1387
01:31:27,194 --> 01:31:28,094
真是太可惜了
I almost pity you.

1388
01:31:28,094 --> 01:31:29,994
分子结构
Molecular structure.

1389
01:31:31,260 --> 01:31:32,192
蝾螈
A salamander?

1390
01:31:32,827 --> 01:31:33,987
是种动物吧
What kind of salamander?

1391
01:31:34,994 --> 01:31:36,791
生长在南美洲的一种
A rainforest species

1392
01:31:36,927 --> 01:31:38,087
四脚爬行动物
from South America.

1393
01:31:38,860 --> 01:31:39,884
体液剧毒
Its toxin is lethal.

1394
01:31:40,294 --> 01:31:41,761
它的构成成分
And its molecular structure,

1395
01:31:41,860 --> 01:31:43,191
据医学界传说
according to medical legend,

1396
01:31:43,727 --> 01:31:45,786
可以抑制虎烈拉病菌
can suppress cholera bacteria.

1397
01:31:46,693 --> 01:31:48,923
咱们都是为这狗屁任务而来
We're all here for this stupid mission,

1398
01:31:49,027 --> 01:31:50,756
也都是为这狗屁任务而死
and we're all going to die for this stupid mission.

1399
01:31:51,693 --> 01:31:52,793
如果这狗屁疫苗
If we don't even know

1400
01:31:52,793 --> 01:31:54,351
到死都不知道是什么的话
what this stupid vaccine is before we die,

1401
01:31:55,160 --> 01:31:56,354
你觉得冤吗
will you die happy?

1402
01:31:58,361 --> 01:32:00,261
我说了也没用
Even if I tell you, it doesn't matter.

1403
01:32:01,227 --> 01:32:02,660
其实现在亚洲
Right now, in Asia, 

1404
01:32:02,827 --> 01:32:04,852
根本没有这种动物的原体
not a single specimen exists.

1405
01:32:05,227 --> 01:32:07,661
除非按分子式做实验
The only way is to synthesize it.

1406
01:32:10,294 --> 01:32:11,591
什么分子式
What's the molecular structure?

1407
01:32:12,626 --> 01:32:13,615
你懂吗
Would you understand?

1408
01:32:18,027 --> 01:32:18,789
不懂
No.

1409
01:32:35,660 --> 01:32:36,149

对不起
I'm sorry.

1415
01:32:52,227 --> 01:32:54,354
后面的  我也不记得了
I don't remember the rest.

1416
01:33:04,361 --> 01:33:05,919
时间
More time!

1417
01:33:13,260 --> 01:33:14,056
行了
Alright.

1418
01:33:14,194 --> 01:33:15,684
咱们几个去收拾收拾
Let's clean ourselves up.

1419
01:33:16,160 --> 01:33:17,684
死也得死出点儿样来
Let's try and die with some dignity.

1420
01:33:18,660 --> 01:33:20,321
马上就要见爹娘了
We're about to meet our parents.

1421
01:33:21,393 --> 01:33:23,953
咱们得利利落落精精神神的
We ought to have clear minds and clean hearts.

1422
01:33:24,426 --> 01:33:25,827
您那儿有什么规矩
Do you have any last rites

1423
01:33:25,827 --> 01:33:27,089
我这儿能帮衬的吗
I can help you with?

1424
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:29,622
这个样子
It's like this,

1425
01:33:30,827 --> 01:33:32,886
我们日本人是要剖腹的
in Japan, we commit seppuku.

1426
01:33:35,760 --> 01:33:37,387
那是很隆重的仪式
It's a very important ritual.

1427
01:33:38,960 --> 01:33:39,892
可惜呀
It's a shame.

1428
01:33:40,227 --> 01:33:41,360
你们的人恐怕
I'm afraid your people

1429
01:33:41,360 --> 01:33:42,987
不会给你这个时间了吧
won't give you enough time for that.

1430
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:44,786
他们会给的
They will.

1431
01:33:45,260 --> 01:33:46,318
因为在日本
Because in Japan, 

1432
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:50,191
死亡是一件很神圣的事
death is a sacred thing.

1433
01:33:56,360 --> 01:33:59,090
请将最后的毁灭延时一小时
PLEASE EXTEND THE DEMOLITION BY ONE HOUR

1434
01:34:08,027 --> 01:34:10,996
请将最后的毁灭延时一小时

请开门
Open the door.

1442
01:34:44,194 --> 01:34:45,684
我是大日本国

陆军华北驻屯军的代表
of Japan's Kwantung North China Army.

1444
01:34:48,293 --> 01:34:49,317
我来谈判
I'm here to negotiate.

1445
01:35:15,293 --> 01:35:17,818
（没想到是你们）
(I never imagined it was you.)

1446
