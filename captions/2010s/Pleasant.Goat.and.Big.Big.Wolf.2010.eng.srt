1
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:49,740
Since time immemorial,

2
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,860
wolves had hunted sheep for food.

3
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:55,140
The sheep community experienced great
suffering from the wolves'  constant fhreat.

4
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:55,940
One day

5
00:00:55,940 --> 00:01:01,458
one wolf ancestor invented
a special method of cooking.

6
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:05,060
The Mutton Hotpot was first launched
by the wolves with much aplomb.

7
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:07,060
Just as the voracious wolves were getting smug

8
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:10,140
all the young sheep disappeared
suddenly from the grassland.

9
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,940
The sheep ancestors had succeeded
in cultivating white cabbage for food!

10
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,740
Thus,the sheep didn't need to risk their
lives foraging and grazing inthe grass land.

11
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:19,860
For a thousand years,the struggle continued
unabated between the wolves and sheep.

12
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:25,332
The wolves'  burning desire
to savor the infamous Mutton
Hotpot was kept very much alive.

13
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,860
Tonight,we attack the Sheep Village.

14
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,940
We are going to kill all the fat sheep.

15
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:54,140
To commemorate the millennial anniversary
of the Mutton Hotpot's launch!

16
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:59,658
Dip-boiled Mutton!

17
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,660
Honey,this is my 214th promise to you.

18
00:02:11,660 --> 00:02:15,540
I will definitely capture 214
young fat sheep for you.

19
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:18,060
Capture 10,000 sheep if you can

20
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,532
but please return home safely.

21
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:29,858
Honey,we will surely have tasty
mutton to celebrate Valentine Day.

22
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:46,660
Daddy can Fly!!!

23
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:52,132
Daddy can Fly!!! Daddy can Fly!!!

24
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,740
Let's begin the celebrations!

25
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:09,740
To the accomplishment of cultivating
white cabbage for a millennium!

26
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:15,258
Wah! Ha,ha

27
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:41,060
Ha,ha,my dear little sheep,
How are you guys doing?

28
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:46,060
Watch out! It's Wolffy. Run!

29
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,540
Don't look so surprised.

30
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:55,058
Why don't all of you celebrate
the holidays at my house.

31
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:11,058
Ha,ha,ha,ha

32
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,340
Let's see where can all of you hide. He,he...

33
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,140
Village Chief! What should we do?

34
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:24,658
Secret weapon!!

35
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:33,932
What kind of a joke is this?

36
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,660
Hey,get out of my way.

37
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:51,132
Don't obstruct my plan to capture the Sheep.

38
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:15,732
Ha,ha,ha,ha

39
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:46,580
Who are you?

40
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:52,098
Heh!

41
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,500
Idiot,he is the super-deadly......

42
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:03,780
Super-invincible Chairman of the World
Animal Foundation for the Tiger Year.

43
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:06,180
The majestic Lord Japper.

44
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:09,980
Kung Hei Fat Choy!! Kung Hei Fat Choy!!

45
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:15,498
Demolish our houses and still want
to greet us Happy New Year???

46
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,700
Stop! Stop now!

47
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:20,580
It's good to demolish them
to build an amusement par.

48
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,500
Don't you know how much
fun it is to play in a park?

49
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,980
Amusement park? How big is it?

50
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:33,498
Super-humongous.

51
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,180
The boundary of the amusement
park will be marked by the point

52
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,180
Where this piece of stone hits the ground.

53
00:08:40,180 --> 00:08:43,300
Wow?

54
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,580
Ha,ha,ha.

55
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:50,098
Cool Leopold

56
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:03,100
Great,Let's begin!.

57
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:08,572
No!

58
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,500
It is so wonderfull.

59
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,180
I want to sit in the Roller Coaster.

60
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:45,698
I want to ride the Merry-Go-Round,
where do we buy the tickets?

61
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:53,300
What tickets?

62
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,380
All of you are the amusement
park's working staff.

63
00:09:55,380 --> 00:10:00,898
Un!

64
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:06,698
Get back to work!

65
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,300
Lord Japper is very kind.

66
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:15,780
The amusement park is
adopting a 2-hour shift system.

67
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:21,298
Thank goodness,we will finish our work shift soon.

68
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,100
Oh! You have misunderstood me.

69
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:28,572
The 2-hour shift system means all of
you only get 2 hours to eat and rest.

70
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:32,100
What? This is cruelty to animals!

71
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:35,580
This is unfair?

72
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:41,098
You want to argue with
Lord Japper abouf fairness?

73
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,300
Are you threatening us?

74
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,380
We want fairness!

75
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,700
Fairness! Fairness! Fairness!

76
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:51,580
Ha,ha. You want us to be fair,no problem.

77
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,300
Then I will treat you fairly now.

78
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,900
First,Let me show you what I mean by fairness.

79
00:10:56,900 --> 00:11:01,700
Second,All of you listen to me.

80
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,980
Is there a third option?

81
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:07,700
Yes.

82
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,700
I am not a house,then how do I demolish it?

83
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:16,172
My friend,can you see it clearly.

84
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:24,698
Big Humphrey,you are really humpy bumpy now.

85
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:31,698
Ha,ha,Happy,you have got what you deserved.

86
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,900
If you don't go to hunt the sheep now,

87
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,700
you won't live till tomorrow.

88
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:41,172
Honey,please don't be mad
withme,I will go tonight.

89
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:56,580
How dare you disturb the home
of Wolffy,Lord of the grass land

90
00:11:56,580 --> 00:12:02,098
are you tired of living?

91
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:05,100
My Lord Japper,see how
breezy and airy is this castle.

92
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,500
Yes,very suitable for a public toilet!

93
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,300
Alright.

94
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:13,780
Where should we live?

95
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:17,900
I am very sorry,I have not thought about it yet.

96
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,180
Guards!

97
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:21,580
Wait a second.

98
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:23,180
Are you planning to usurp my castle?

99
00:12:23,180 --> 00:12:28,698
You have to first ask my relatives!

100
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,580
Brothers,some strangers are
trying to usurp my castle.

101
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,100
Would you let them?

102
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,100
Sure!!!!

103
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,500
Did you hear me?

104
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,380
What! Uncle Avidor,Gildot
and Boxtor and dear cousins!

105
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:45,380
Hey,are we not relatives!

106
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:49,500
We must accept sound reasoning,
and not just favor our relatives.

107
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,700
Honey,what should we do now?

108
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:55,100
Lord Japper had shown us how fair
he was when he visited our homes .

109
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,500
Show us how fair you
are,show us how fair you are.

110
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:04,700
You want me to show you how fair I am?

111
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,700
Huh,look like if I don't show my prowness today

112
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,300
all of you will not know how powerful I am.

113
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,500
Honey,please leave with Howie.

114
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:18,900
I don't want him to witness
any physical violence.

115
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,100
Goodbye,Uncle!!

116
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,380
Mommy!!

117
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:25,700
What is Daddy going to do?

118
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:31,172
Daddy is going to......

119
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:35,100
I shall return!

120
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:40,572
Oh,Daddy wants to fly! Daddy,fly higher!

121
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,100
You are late for work!

122
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:22,300
Do you want Load Japper to
talk some sense into you?

123
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,100
No,no,no! It's my first day of work

124
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:30,572
I don't know what to do......

125
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:33,580
He,he,you don't need to do anything

126
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,580
you just need to sleep!

127
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,380
Marvellous,this is indeed a great job

128
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:42,898
I will accept it.

129
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:59,140
It's now showtime,and we are going to
perform for the animals of the grass land.

130
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:04,612
Dear friends,it is my great
pleasure to present Lord Japper.

131
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:16,420
Welcome!! Welcome!!!

132
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:21,938
Today,we are going to present
an enchanting magic show.

133
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:28,740
I don't want to be a stage-prop! Help! Help!

134
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:29,740
Why are you yelling?

135
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,820
You are supposed to help me in
the perform for the audience!

136
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,020
Leopold!

137
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:39,538
Wow!~

138
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:45,620
Is it for real,are they really
going to saw him in two?

139
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:51,138
Help! Help!

140
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:57,219
Help! Help!Please help me!

141
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,540
Hey! What's going on.

142
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:03,740
I'm really upset.

143
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:06,020
A power failure now?

144
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,340
Everybody is enjoying the show now!

145
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:10,420
Lord Japper.

146
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:12,220
Relax. My Lord.

147
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:16,620
If only we can find the legendary
emerald power source.

148
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:20,020
Tigbot King's power will never fail again.

149
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,220
My Lord,you can then amuse
yourself for as long as you want.

150
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,020
Then where is the emerald power source?

151
00:16:26,020 --> 00:16:28,140
I am using the supercomputer
to search for the power source.

152
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:28,940
We will find the source soon...

153
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,740
I don't want it to be soon!

154
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,140
I want the power source now! Leopold!

155
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:37,612
Wow!~~

156
00:17:11,820 --> 00:17:15,740
Ha,ha,now we can continue the show and
continue to have fun with the animals.

157
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:16,940
My Lord.

158
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:20,740
For the sake of preserving the
grassland,please switch off Tigbot King.

159
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:23,020
Oh,but why?

160
00:17:23,020 --> 00:17:25,020
If this goes on

161
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:29,340
very soon the entire grassland
will wither and turn into a desert.

162
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,540
Um,there is some merit in
what you say. Counselor!

163
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,140
Please don't be fooled by him,
My lord! This old sheep...

164
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,540
He is super-crafty.

165
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:40,740
If we switch off Tigbot King,you
will no longer have fun.

166
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:44,140
Right! We are having so much
fun in the amusement park!

167
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,540
Why are you so selfish,you old sheep.

168
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:48,020
Why don't you think of the animals'  interests?

169
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,020
My Lord!

170
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,620
In fact you are the one who is selfish

171
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,020
You are not being fair to others.

172
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:57,538
Being fair? Guards!

173
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:06,938
Show them the meaning of fairness!

174
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:21,212
Dinner time!

175
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:30,620
Welcome. Let me treat all of
you to some delicious food.

176
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:36,138
No additives,non-fried,super-healthy.

177
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:43,738
High-tech nanoparticle-based Lord
Japper canned cold noodles,yummy!

178
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,820
Oh my goodness!

179
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,340
We are not eating noodles

180
00:18:53,340 --> 00:18:55,140
we are eating loneliness.

181
00:18:55,140 --> 00:19:00,612
Is it possible to eat lonliness?

182
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:06,140
This can't be eaten!

183
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:10,740
Luckily. I have saved some food.

184
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:14,020
Big Brother ,what is this?

185
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:19,340
This,is a piece of stone.

186
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:23,820
Big Brother,my Daddy can fly.

187
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,820
My Daddy loves to eat stones,too.

188
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:31,338
My whole family loves to eat stones.

189
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:41,540
Alright,alright,I will share the food with you.

190
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:47,012
Thank you,Big Brother!

191
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:58,020
Look,Big Brother,the food has grown,

192
00:19:58,020 --> 00:20:00,140
let's eat together.

193
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:03,540
Honey,our cub is so hungry
that he is hallucinating.

194
00:20:03,540 --> 00:20:06,940
There Is No Sheep Hunting
rule in the staff handbook.

195
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,620
Otherwise,I would have have hunted a few-----

196
00:20:08,620 --> 00:20:12,020
The village chief has fainted.

197
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,940
Village Chief!!   Village Chief!

198
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,540
Cough!cough!...

199
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,940
Pesticides?

200
00:20:18,940 --> 00:20:20,420
Aye,if this continues

201
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,340
we will either work to death
or be poisoned by pesticides.

202
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,940
What should we do now

203
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:29,340
we are no match for the big tiger.

204
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:34,020
If only we can find the legendary Totem.

205
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,340
Village Chief,what Totem?

206
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:39,820
My great grandfather had told me a legend.

207
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:45,140
There is a mysterious citadel wth a golden-spire,

208
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:48,820
Which is inhabited by a generous
and kind sheep guardian saint

209
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:52,140
protecting the sheep species' Totem.

210
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,540
Once we can unravel the secrets of the Totem

211
00:20:54,540 --> 00:20:57,940
then we will be invincible.

212
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,740
Village Chief,is it really true?

213
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:05,820
Then we can defeat Lord
Japper! Where is this place?

214
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:10,220
It's in ... in...

215
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:12,940
In a faraway place

216
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:15,020
there is an elderly sheep......

217
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:18,820
Your Mommy is calling you for dinner...

218
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:24,338
Is the Village Chief is going insane!!

219
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:50,738
Where is the kitchen? I am starving to death.

220
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:29,980
Who are you? Password!

221
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:32,460
Glory to Lord Japper!!

222
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:37,978
Eh,glory to Lord Japper! Salute!

223
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:46,052
I am scared,but luckily I have quick reflexes.

224
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:51,980
Oops,I manage to bluff my way through..

225
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:55,180
I am brilliant,and no one can match me.

226
00:22:55,180 --> 00:23:00,652
Brilliant and no one can match me.

227
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:27,978
Am I seeing things?

228
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:37,778
Trash foods!

229
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:50,460
Evil lizard! ,we have been
eating food made from trash.

230
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,978
You hide here to feast on good food.

231
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:21,578
Damn it!

232
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:36,460
No,I better save this food
for my wife and cub to eat.

233
00:24:36,460 --> 00:24:38,860
There should be more food.Let me check.

234
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:44,378
Kong~~

235
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,780
Do you want to scare me to death?

236
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:14,252
Eh? Why are you here?

237
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:20,060
Wh-what's wrong?

238
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,780
I have damaged the amusment
park's power supply.

239
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,860
Even the construction
workbots can't move now,

240
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,180
Hurry,run away with your whole family now!

241
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:32,580
No wonder you are called
Happy,a bagful of tricks.

242
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:37,580
Power failure again?

243
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,380
You are really naive

244
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:43,860
haven't you heard of a power
generator rechargeable by batteries?

245
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,260
This is bad news!

246
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,460
What should we do now?

247
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:52,660
Run for our lives!

248
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:56,460
We should make our move now! Leopold!

249
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:01,978
Wow!~~

250
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,260
Leopold!

251
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,860
Wow!~~

252
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:25,378
Capture the wolf!

253
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:34,178
Leopold,He is there!

254
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:42,652
Stop harassing me.

255
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:55,052
No!

256
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:03,580
Wow!~~

257
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:07,780
I surrender,I surrender!

258
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:11,260
How dare you try to destroy my den!

259
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,660
I am not here to destroy your den.

260
00:27:13,660 --> 00:27:19,178
Then what are you doing here?Stealing?

261
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:24,060
Eh,alright.I am here to destroy your den.

262
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:27,980
Lord Japper,How do we punish them?

263
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,060
I give you two choices.

264
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:32,980
First,reason with me...

265
00:27:32,980 --> 00:27:34,180
I take the second choice!

266
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:37,180
What?

267
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:39,980
Fine,You are the first one to choose second.

268
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,060
Leopold.

269
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,860
Wow!~~

270
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,980
Ah! What do you want to do?

271
00:27:45,980 --> 00:27:51,452
Go! Explore the great desert...

272
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:06,980
Where are we?

273
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:12,452
It is your fault! You bring me
bad luck every time we meet.

274
00:28:19,460 --> 00:28:24,978
I shall return--

275
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:40,980
No water,no food.

276
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:44,260
How do we trek out of the desert?

277
00:28:44,260 --> 00:28:49,778
He,he,maybe there is a way.

278
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:58,460
Wolffy,you still have the egg!

279
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:01,580
Give it back to me!

280
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:07,052
It is for my wife and cub...

281
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,860
Can't eat it!

282
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:14,980
I see you still have some sense
of responsibility to your family.

283
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,660
I have misjudged you.

284
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,860
You are right!

285
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:21,060
Then you should help me!

286
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:24,580
Even if you eat me now,you
will still die in the desert.

287
00:29:24,580 --> 00:29:26,980
But I will die after you!

288
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:29,780
Village Chief fell sick after
he had eaten the canned food!

289
00:29:29,780 --> 00:29:30,780
Then what happen next?

290
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,260
Because of this!

291
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:35,580
Sore throat,fever,hallucination....

292
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:39,420
H1N1! Are you infected?

293
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:43,900
If you eat me,you will be infected too.

294
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:49,418
It is really disappointing that I can't
eat you when you are at my lips..

295
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:56,692
Earlier I have warned you not to eat me!

296
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:03,492
I am hallucinating,I have got the flu!

297
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:09,620
It is not a hallucination! It is the
citadel with the golden-spire!

298
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:12,100
So Village Chief was right!

299
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:15,020
Is there roast mutton to eat in the citadel?

300
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:16,700
There is a mysterious place
with a golden-spire citadel.

301
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:21,100
The Totem is inside the citadel.

302
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:22,700
Once we possess the Totem

303
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,620
we can escape from the desert.

304
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,700
We will be invincible.

305
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:31,020
Then we can defeat Lord Japper and his sidekicks!

306
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:33,900
I can then save my wife and cub!

307
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:37,420
What are we waiting for! Let's go inside!

308
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:42,892
Hey! Wait a second...

309
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:52,692
Oh! It is just a mirage...

310
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:09,418
The batteries are discharged!

311
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:11,620
They are not the emerald power source!

312
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:14,620
Counselor,Tigbot King has stopped again...

313
00:31:14,620 --> 00:31:17,300
Relax,my Lord

314
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:19,700
we have explored all nooks and corners of the
world in search of the emerald power source.

315
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,500
It must be here.

316
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,620
But,if Tigbot King can continue to deliver power

317
00:31:26,620 --> 00:31:28,820
this place will turn into a desert soon?

318
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:32,100
So be it,let the whole world turn into a desert.

319
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,020
When that happens,the animals
will have no habitats to live in

320
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:39,492
and they will stay here to play with you.

321
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:43,620
Look! It must be here,come here everyone!

322
00:31:43,620 --> 00:31:47,700
Move faster!

323
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,500
In order for Lord Japper to continue
having fun with the animals

324
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:53,500
in order for the amusement
park to continue operating.

325
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,620
Everybody must be fully dedicated to the task.

326
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:00,100
All of you must be totally committed
to excavating the emerald power source

327
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,020
Who is so committed to the task?

328
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:08,492
Do you want Lord Japper
to show you some fairness?

329
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,500
Dark clouds,it's going to rain!

330
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,500
Chase! Chase!

331
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:38,018
Run! Run! Run!

332
00:32:55,300 --> 00:33:00,818
This,this is killing me!

333
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,300
Counselor,why do we excavate so much coal?

334
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:19,020
It is not the emerald power source!

335
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,100
Since the emerald power source is a legend

336
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,700
it must be well-hidden and
buried very deep underground.

337
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:26,420
It must be...,it must be...

338
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,620
It must be what?

339
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,900
Only after we have excavated all the coal,

340
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:33,820
then we can expose the emerald power source.

341
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:36,820
Continue to excavate the coal.

342
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:40,100
The emerald power source!

343
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:44,093
The emerald power source!

344
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:04,900
Is it another mirage again?

345
00:34:04,900 --> 00:34:10,418
Let's have some rest.

346
00:34:20,820 --> 00:34:23,620
You are still thinking of
eating mutton all the time!

347
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,100
Aren't you tired?

348
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:29,420
Of course I am tired! This is all fated.

349
00:34:29,420 --> 00:34:30,820
If wolves do not hunt and eat sheep

350
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:34,300
then do you expect them
to eat fried rice with egg?

351
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:38,900
Do you think it is an easy
to be Lord of the grass land.

352
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:43,300
That is right. We sheep
will instinctively avoid you.

353
00:34:43,300 --> 00:34:45,620
This is the law of nature.

354
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,620
It is easier to be a sheep than to be a wolf.

355
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,820
You can eat and drink all day;

356
00:34:49,820 --> 00:34:51,020
frolicking and playing hide-and-seek.

357
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:56,300
You face less mental pressure than me.

358
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:00,820
You are not so bad either.
Every sheep is scared of you.

359
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:03,620
You have a wonderful family.

360
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,820
Then there is me,working
against you all the time.

361
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:07,100
Isn't it challenging!

362
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,420
Is it fun to work against me?

363
00:35:09,420 --> 00:35:12,620
Of course,it is my calling.

364
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:18,092
You......Yeah,right,I got used to it!

365
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:22,020
It is meaningless to reminisce now.

366
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:27,492
We have no opportunity to
challenge each other again.

367
00:35:36,220 --> 00:35:41,692
Go to hunt some sheep,and be back by dinner!

368
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:50,892
Happy,aren't you always brave and determined?

369
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:55,420
Mommy believes you can escape from the desert

370
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,220
Mommy will always support you...

371
00:35:57,220 --> 00:36:00,100
You are always my good lad...

372
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,820
Mommy...Mommy...

373
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:03,700
Honey...Howie...

374
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:09,218
Mommy...

375
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:18,100
Ah? Trouble!

376
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:23,618
Stop looking; it is another mirage...

377
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:30,420
It's a sand storm!

378
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:35,892
Run!

379
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:44,218
Mr. Wolffy,I know what to do!

380
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:50,300
Wolffy! Run faster!

381
00:36:50,300 --> 00:36:55,818
I should have devoured you earlier.

382
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:20,860
Golden-Spire citadel?

383
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:26,332
Ah,kind-hearted guardian saints!

384
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:35,058
This must be another mirage.

385
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:41,932
It is real,they are the guardian saints.

386
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:50,260
Who are you? What do you want?

387
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,940
I am the progeny of the sheep community.

388
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:55,340
May I ask whether the invincible totem is inside?

389
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:57,660
Yes,it is inside. Go in and find it yourself.

390
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,260
How do we know where to look for it?

391
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,060
What kind of attitude is that?

392
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:05,340
Hey,I will lodge a complaint against you!

393
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,860
What a nuisance.

394
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,460
According to our rules,

395
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,460
you must first answer our question correctly.

396
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,940
Ah. What for?

397
00:38:12,940 --> 00:38:17,940
Our rules must be observed.

398
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,060
OK. Go ahead and ask.

399
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:25,532
It is simple. How many stars are there in the sky?

400
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,940
Are you trying to trick us?

401
00:38:32,940 --> 00:38:38,458
Sorry,we are just following our orders.

402
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:43,140
Ha,ha...I have the answer.

403
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,140
There are as many stars in the sky

404
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:47,860
as there are particles of sands here.

405
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,060
Happy,you are brilliant!

406
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,340
Really?

407
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:56,858
Of course it is true,you can count them yourself.

408
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:01,940
One,two,three,four,five,six...

409
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:07,458
Mr Ramhead,Mr Wolface...

410
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:09,340
Hey,it is countless

411
00:39:09,340 --> 00:39:14,660
Can both of you let us enter the
citadel to look for the Totem.

412
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,140
I have miscounted again.

413
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:19,540
What are both of you grumbling about?

414
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:25,058
Wah...

415
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,740
What an unpleasant sheep guardian saint?

416
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:38,140
He is worse than Lord Japper.

417
00:39:38,140 --> 00:39:41,940
There is also the Wolface sphinx?

418
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,340
Maybe we can get out by this way....

419
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:48,858
Nonsense!

420
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:14,258
What is this! Happy,quick,think of a solution.

421
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:20,332
It is not very deep down. Let's jump together!

422
00:40:23,260 --> 00:40:28,732
Hey you,don't knock onto me?

423
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:35,740
Ah! Ach! My feet are hurting!

424
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:40,460
What are you complaining?
Aren't your feet sfill intact?

425
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:43,940
Right. Ha,ha...

426
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:49,458
We have made it! The chain has snapped! Ha,ha...

427
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:56,460
Watch out!

428
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:58,660
Run,Wolffy!

429
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:01,060
These mechanical traps are deadly!

430
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:06,532
Wait for me,Happy!

431
00:41:12,060 --> 00:41:17,532
Wolffy,right here!

432
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:52,140
Village Chief,the roller coaster has been modified

433
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:55,340
It should scale over the electric fence.

434
00:41:55,340 --> 00:42:00,858
Shu~~quiet! Don't let them find out.

435
00:42:01,060 --> 00:42:04,260
Village Chief,can we really escape?

436
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:06,340
No problem.

437
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,740
Based on my calculation and modification

438
00:42:08,740 --> 00:42:10,860
this roller coaster can

439
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:15,460
definitely scale over the
fence of the amusement park.

440
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,740
Trust my calculation.

441
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:20,140
We can definitely scale over and escape!

442
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:25,658
Village Chief! Can we have another choice?

443
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:33,060
No choice!

444
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:37,540
Village Chief,do we wait for Happy?

445
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:40,940
After we have escaped,then we will look for him.

446
00:42:40,940 --> 00:42:46,458
With his intelligence,he can escape unscathed.

447
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:54,940
Wait a second.

448
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:57,660
Hollie? What is she doing here?

449
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:00,740
Village Chief,please wait.

450
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:05,340
Wait. Please,please...

451
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:09,940
Please let Howie leave with you!

452
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:12,660
Don't try any tricks now!

453
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:14,060
You want to get on to the roller coaster

454
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,860
and wait for an opportunity
to devour us,isn't it?

455
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:21,540
Oh no! I am not planning to escape.

456
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:24,460
I just don't want my cub to stay here and suffer.

457
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:27,860
He is only a cub and he has a kind heart.

458
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:30,540
He never wishes to hurt anyone.

459
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:31,860
Mommy,I want to eat mutton!

460
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,660
I want to eat mutton! I want to eat mutton!

461
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:36,740
Foolish child!

462
00:43:36,740 --> 00:43:38,740
He is very humorous!

463
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:43,740
Village Chief! Don't believe her story!

464
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,540
I am begging you!

465
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:48,940
As his mother,I wish Howie can be saved.

466
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:52,340
I don't have any other wishes.

467
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:54,660
Village Chief! Please accept her request!

468
00:43:54,660 --> 00:43:59,460
Ten seats and adding two......
there are not enough seats!

469
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:02,340
He is small. He won't take up much space.

470
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:06,140
Mommy,where are we heading to?

471
00:44:06,140 --> 00:44:09,340
My little sweetie,Mommy
won't be with you anymore.

472
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:12,060
You can't be childish anymore.

473
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:15,940
Listen to your older brothers
and sisters,don't be naughty.

474
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:18,260
Take good care of yourself.

475
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,060
Mommy...

476
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,940
I am so touched...Wail,wail...

477
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:24,780
They are so pitiful!

478
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:29,380
village Chief.Please agree fo fheir requesf!

479
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:31,580
OK,fine.

480
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:34,100
Both of you can come on board.

481
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:36,780
Thank you very much! I am overjoyed!

482
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:41,500
Lance,please help me to hold on to Howie.

483
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:46,972
Ten plus two...

484
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:54,780
Trouble! Overloaded!

485
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:59,980
Beauty,are you alright!

486
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:01,500
I am so scared!

487
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:06,972
Everybody watch out! Here it comes again!

488
00:45:12,500 --> 00:45:17,972
Planning to escape! Leopold,Get them!

489
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:25,772
Ten plus two... What is the answer?

490
00:45:27,300 --> 00:45:30,900
One,Two,Three,Four,Five......

491
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:36,372
Ten plus two. Uncle,what is ten plus two?

492
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:42,372
Wao!~~

493
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:49,372
Uncle,you can't leave
without giving me an answer?

494
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:56,298
Get them to come down.

495
00:45:57,500 --> 00:46:02,972
Useless! Leopold!

496
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:18,572
Hold it...

497
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:35,172
Perfect!

498
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:47,100
Ah? Trouble!

499
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:52,572
Lord Japper,they are all down below.

500
00:46:58,100 --> 00:47:01,180
Guards,tie them up!

501
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:06,698
Yes!

502
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:11,500
We can't escape now.

503
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,580
Let's think of another escape plan...

504
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:18,100
I have it!

505
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:21,900
We can surrender!

506
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:25,180
Sounds like a good idea....

507
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:27,180
No! If we give up

508
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:32,100
We will still be tortured by Lord Japper.

509
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:37,572
Then what should we do? My dear husband~~~

510
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:06,498
Nice rhythm,right,Sweetie?

511
00:49:06,700 --> 00:49:12,172
Sweetie?

512
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:14,700
You can't even take care of your own son

513
00:49:14,700 --> 00:49:18,380
you are more careless than Lance!

514
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:19,700
Err? Where is Lance?

515
00:49:19,700 --> 00:49:20,780
Lance!

516
00:49:20,780 --> 00:49:26,298
Howie!

517
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:33,372
I saw them flew this way and dropped down here.

518
00:49:46,780 --> 00:49:50,580
Big Brother Lance,you are great!

519
00:49:50,580 --> 00:49:55,380
Of course,I am brilliant
and no one can match me...

520
00:49:55,380 --> 00:50:00,898
brilliant and no one can match me...

521
00:50:03,380 --> 00:50:05,900
Oops...Want to uncover my secret?

522
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:09,500
For heaven's sake,I am
to get rid of both of you.

523
00:50:09,500 --> 00:50:13,100
Ho~~~

524
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:18,572
My good partner will take good care of you!

525
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,900
Big Brother Lance!

526
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:38,580
What now?

527
00:50:38,580 --> 00:50:41,380
There is a park.

528
00:50:41,380 --> 00:50:46,898
Why is there is a park here?

529
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:55,898
Oh! This is ...

530
00:50:57,300 --> 00:51:01,300
This is not a park! This is...

531
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:06,772
Heaven!!

532
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:10,980
Big Brother Lance,is it edible?

533
00:51:10,980 --> 00:51:16,498
Yes,yes!

534
00:51:17,300 --> 00:51:19,700
Wow,this fruit is really fresh!

535
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:23,380
Big Brother,taste this.

536
00:51:23,380 --> 00:51:26,580
Wow~~ this is really fresh!

537
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:32,098
Eh! Well done!

538
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:40,780
Wow...

539
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:46,298
WOW~~

540
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,140
What is happening?

541
00:51:51,140 --> 00:51:52,820
Don't bother too much,let's get over first.

542
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:56,540
It is very painful. The pain is killing me!

543
00:51:56,540 --> 00:51:59,820
Stop pushing me,Happy!

544
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:03,420
You go first!

545
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:08,938
Ouch! What is this?

546
00:52:16,020 --> 00:52:21,538
Pass!

547
00:52:24,940 --> 00:52:29,020
Happy,you are really nasty!

548
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:32,020
Damn it,I shall return!

549
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:35,820
Wrong! I will never be come
back to this horrible place!

550
00:52:35,820 --> 00:52:36,740
Before we plan to return,

551
00:52:36,740 --> 00:52:42,212
we must first get out of this place.

552
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:54,940
Ha,ha,see what I've found?

553
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,020
Could this be the place

554
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:58,220
where the invincible Totem is hidden?

555
00:52:58,220 --> 00:53:00,940
If we find the Totem,then we can go home,

556
00:53:00,940 --> 00:53:06,412
and save my wife and cub.

557
00:53:37,540 --> 00:53:38,540
This must definitely be

558
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:40,740
the Totem described by Village Chief

559
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:44,420
Not possible,it is just a piece of paper?

560
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:45,220
Calm down,

561
00:53:45,220 --> 00:53:49,340
let's roll it up and take it back for examination.

562
00:53:49,340 --> 00:53:53,220
Be careful,don't damage it.

563
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:54,620
Err,what's this smell?

564
00:53:54,620 --> 00:53:57,140
It is as fragrant as roast meat.

565
00:53:57,140 --> 00:54:02,612
Your fail is on fire!

566
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:16,740
Look up!

567
00:54:16,740 --> 00:54:18,940
Let's jump up quickly!

568
00:54:18,940 --> 00:54:24,220
Good! It is my turn now.

569
00:54:24,220 --> 00:54:27,220
Watch out.!!!

570
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:28,020
We can beat Liu Xiang.

571
00:54:28,020 --> 00:54:32,940
And break the world record!

572
00:54:32,940 --> 00:54:34,140
Great!

573
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:37,420
Of course! Err,where is the exit?

574
00:54:37,420 --> 00:54:38,940
There is no exit.

575
00:54:38,940 --> 00:54:40,620
Then why do we jump up for?

576
00:54:40,620 --> 00:54:42,820
To check whether there is an exit here.

577
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:45,940
What?

578
00:54:45,940 --> 00:54:50,540
It looks like we are going to
be barbecued meat soon.

579
00:54:50,540 --> 00:54:52,220
Hold tight!

580
00:54:52,220 --> 00:54:55,820
What kind of trouble is waiting for us ahead?

581
00:54:55,820 --> 00:55:01,338
479 billion 800 million and one.

582
00:55:03,140 --> 00:55:04,620
It's you again?

583
00:55:04,620 --> 00:55:07,940
Ah...I see you have managed to find the Totem?

584
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:10,740
Why do you pull out the stone slab?

585
00:55:10,740 --> 00:55:16,212
To record the number of grains of sand.

586
00:55:17,740 --> 00:55:18,820
Let's not bother them anymore

587
00:55:18,820 --> 00:55:21,420
I want to head home to rescue my wife and cub..

588
00:55:21,420 --> 00:55:25,940
No! You can't leave until we finish counting.

589
00:55:25,940 --> 00:55:27,540
Why?

590
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:32,340
Because rules are rules.

591
00:55:32,340 --> 00:55:34,740
How long do we have to wait?

592
00:55:34,740 --> 00:55:37,340
I need to rush back to rescue all the sheep.

593
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:41,020
It won't take long,we have already counted......

594
00:55:41,020 --> 00:55:44,140
Oh? What is the number now?

595
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:48,340
I have forgotten too,let's start all over again.

596
00:55:48,340 --> 00:55:51,020
Please be patient,

597
00:55:51,020 --> 00:55:52,620
as soon as we finish counting...

598
00:55:52,620 --> 00:55:53,940
No need to count!

599
00:55:53,940 --> 00:55:58,220
Because there are no stars at all!

600
00:55:58,220 --> 00:56:01,820
If you don't believe,look up the sky now.

601
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:04,420
Really! There are no stars!

602
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:06,620
The mystery that has been
bothering us for 2000 years

603
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:08,540
is finally solved! Wail,wail...

604
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:09,740
To reward you,

605
00:56:09,740 --> 00:56:15,212
we will send you home in the fastest way

606
00:56:23,020 --> 00:56:24,940
Climb up and seat down.

607
00:56:24,940 --> 00:56:27,340
Is this your sleeping rug?

608
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:30,140
This is really a magic rug.

609
00:56:30,140 --> 00:56:35,612
The 2010 Limited Edition.

610
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:41,420
How to get it to lift off?

611
00:56:41,420 --> 00:56:44,620
Is there a seat-belt?

612
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:47,940
Goodbye!

613
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:53,412
See you! Come and visit us again!

614
00:56:56,220 --> 00:56:59,940
Almost the whole region has turned into a desert.

615
00:56:59,940 --> 00:57:02,540
Perhaps,only our green grassland

616
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:04,620
hasn't be destroyed.

617
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:07,340
What should we be scared!

618
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:10,020
We have the Totem now.

619
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:11,940
We are invincible.

620
00:57:11,940 --> 00:57:15,140
The three rogues will be
begging for mercy from us.

621
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:20,612
Ha,ha,ha,ha...

622
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:29,540
Wolffy,better sit down.

623
00:57:29,540 --> 00:57:35,012
Happy,can't you be a bit gutsy?

624
00:57:37,540 --> 00:57:43,012
OHHHH.... my egg...

625
00:57:47,420 --> 00:57:50,420
What a fool you are! Are you
not afraid of being killed?

626
00:57:50,420 --> 00:57:55,620
No,but the cooking pan is more scary!!!

627
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:58,340
It's very windy,hold tight.

628
00:57:58,340 --> 00:58:03,812
I am going to adjust the balance of the rug.

629
00:58:18,940 --> 00:58:22,940
Big Brother Lance,let's sing.

630
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:27,140
No,I am not in the mood!

631
00:58:27,140 --> 00:58:31,420
You can nap while I sing you a lullaby.

632
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:35,140
Wake me when the monster returns.

633
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:40,540
I don't need any lullaby to sleep

634
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:43,220
I want to eat a sheep,I want to eat a sheep.

635
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:46,940
Lance,Lance

636
00:58:46,940 --> 00:58:50,220
Who taught you this song?

637
00:58:50,220 --> 00:58:52,340
My daddy taught me this song.

638
00:58:52,340 --> 00:58:55,540
I want to eat sheep; I want to eat sheep.

639
00:58:55,540 --> 00:58:57,420
Here's my Lance...

640
00:58:57,420 --> 00:59:00,340
Will you come to my house,Big Brother?

641
00:59:00,340 --> 00:59:03,420
To sing together?

642
00:59:03,420 --> 00:59:06,340
I want to eat sheep,I want to eat sheep...

643
00:59:06,340 --> 00:59:07,820
No,I won't!

644
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:11,340
Go to your house? You think I am an idiot?

645
00:59:11,340 --> 00:59:12,820
How do you know that?

646
00:59:12,820 --> 00:59:13,780
What?

647
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:16,660
My parents said you are foolish

648
00:59:16,660 --> 00:59:22,178
and the easiest to capture......

649
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:34,452
We're back.

650
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:40,252
Hold tight!

651
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:57,580
Wah! Daddy is flying again!

652
00:59:57,580 --> 01:00:02,780
Daddy is flying! Daddy is flying! Great! Great!

653
01:00:02,780 --> 01:00:04,260
Shu~~Quiet!

654
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:06,460
My Daddy is a flying wolf.

655
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:10,060
Yes! Your Daddy can fly,but we will die.

656
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:15,578
Kong~~

657
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:19,060
This dark shadow is scary.

658
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:21,780
Silence! Don't move!

659
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:25,780
Big Brother Lance,you are so alert.

660
01:00:25,780 --> 01:00:29,060
I have been trained by your father.

661
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:34,578
Daddy is great! Daddy is great!

662
01:00:40,260 --> 01:00:41,780
It's very hot!

663
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:42,980
Hurry,run!

664
01:00:42,980 --> 01:00:46,260
Didn't you ask me to keep still?

665
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:49,780
If you don't hurry up,you will get eaten!

666
01:00:49,780 --> 01:00:53,060
Faster! Run faster!

667
01:00:53,060 --> 01:00:55,780
I hate running! Ouch

668
01:00:55,780 --> 01:00:56,860
Let's play together.

669
01:00:56,860 --> 01:01:02,378
Ha,ha,ha. ha......

670
01:01:02,860 --> 01:01:07,460
I am dirty and lazy! Don't eat me!

671
01:01:07,460 --> 01:01:12,978
Help! Howie!

672
01:01:34,660 --> 01:01:38,860
Just one push and they will all be finished.

673
01:01:38,860 --> 01:01:41,060
You are back.

674
01:01:41,060 --> 01:01:46,578
Eh? How do you manage to come back?

675
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:59,778
As Mr. Wolffy always says,we shall return!

676
01:02:11,860 --> 01:02:17,378
Arrest these two crafty crooks..

677
01:02:17,780 --> 01:02:23,252
We are crafty crooks?

678
01:02:26,260 --> 01:02:30,780
Let's me deal with the leader,

679
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:36,252
and you can take on the other seven guys! Charge!

680
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:42,380
What are you yelling for? You talk too much?

681
01:02:42,380 --> 01:02:46,660
Leopold

682
01:02:46,660 --> 01:02:51,060
Wow!~~

683
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:52,260
I better deal with these seven guys,

684
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:57,778
you take on that one. Charge!

685
01:03:54,580 --> 01:04:00,052
Ping,ping,ping...

686
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:10,252
Wow!~~

687
01:04:14,660 --> 01:04:17,380
It's your turn!

688
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:22,852
Hm! We meet again!

689
01:04:25,780 --> 01:04:28,980
Dear uncles and cousins,

690
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:30,380
If we are truly relatives

691
01:04:30,380 --> 01:04:32,780
Then why are we killing each other...

692
01:04:32,780 --> 01:04:34,980
But you are the one to start the fight!

693
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:38,060
Cousin,please let me go,

694
01:04:38,060 --> 01:04:43,578
I will let you into a top secret.

695
01:04:45,060 --> 01:04:47,660
What kind of secret is this?

696
01:04:47,660 --> 01:04:49,260
Look at this dot

697
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:54,778
Does this look like the cave entrance?

698
01:04:56,380 --> 01:05:01,260
Somewhat similar,but what does it mean?

699
01:05:01,260 --> 01:05:04,980
I don't get it. What's the secret?

700
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:06,580
The secret is...

701
01:05:06,580 --> 01:05:12,052
All of you are finished!

702
01:05:19,660 --> 01:05:25,178
Take it easy,we did not come to capture you...

703
01:05:26,260 --> 01:05:27,860
Only when I get upset,

704
01:05:27,860 --> 01:05:33,378
then I realize how powerful I am.

705
01:05:43,580 --> 01:05:44,380
I will block the entrance

706
01:05:44,380 --> 01:05:49,852
and see you can escape from the cave!

707
01:05:56,260 --> 01:06:01,778
Where are you,Honey?

708
01:06:03,060 --> 01:06:05,260
You dare to trick me!

709
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:09,180
Where are you,honey-----

710
01:06:09,180 --> 01:06:14,652
Honey?

711
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:24,460
Hold on,Honey!

712
01:06:24,460 --> 01:06:29,978
I will come and rescue you!

713
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:37,980
We should unite and work together!

714
01:06:37,980 --> 01:06:39,700
All for one and one for all!

715
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:42,020
All wolves unite!!

716
01:06:42,020 --> 01:06:44,900
I can't hold on any longer.

717
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:48,420
You have to hold on,Honey-----

718
01:06:48,420 --> 01:06:51,420
Don't care about me,it's too dangerous.

719
01:06:51,420 --> 01:06:53,620
You can't leave!

720
01:06:53,620 --> 01:06:57,900
Whatever it is,I won't leave you--

721
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:00,100
We are so touched...

722
01:07:00,100 --> 01:07:03,100
Don't be foolish,either I had nagged you all day

723
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:05,900
Or hit you with a frying pan...

724
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:08,620
I have always enjoyed it.

725
01:07:08,620 --> 01:07:14,092
Wolffy,unleash your power.

726
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:20,818
I love frying pans!

727
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:26,100
It is alright now,Honey,come up now!

728
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:31,618
My dear Hubby!

729
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:38,900
Are you and Howie alright?

730
01:07:38,900 --> 01:07:40,020
Sweetie?

731
01:07:40,020 --> 01:07:42,500
Honey! Howie is missing!

732
01:07:42,500 --> 01:07:48,018
What?! Let's go and find him!

733
01:07:53,420 --> 01:07:58,892
Lord Japper,come here!

734
01:08:02,300 --> 01:08:04,820
Hm,as I said,we will meet again.

735
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:06,500
My Lord,they shall be punished

736
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:09,620
for destroying the amusement park.

737
01:08:09,620 --> 01:08:12,020
I will give you two choices.

738
01:08:12,020 --> 01:08:15,420
First,I exile you to the desert.

739
01:08:15,420 --> 01:08:19,020
Second,you go there yourselves!

740
01:08:19,020 --> 01:08:21,820
We will not obey you anymore!

741
01:08:21,820 --> 01:08:24,820
Yes,we are united. We are not
frightened of you anymore.

742
01:08:24,820 --> 01:08:30,292
Expel them from the green grassland.

743
01:08:37,020 --> 01:08:39,300
What should we do now?

744
01:08:39,300 --> 01:08:44,818
Who wants to reason with me?

745
01:08:51,620 --> 01:08:53,100
It is safer in the pond.

746
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:55,220
We will look for our cub later.

747
01:08:55,220 --> 01:09:00,692
Good idea,good idea!

748
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:05,420
Run,boy!

749
01:09:05,420 --> 01:09:10,892
We must save our cub as soon as possible. Oops.

750
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:14,100
Are you OK,Honey?

751
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:15,700
Oops,my head...

752
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:17,620
But it is not painful now.

753
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,420
Quickly,go and save our cub!

754
01:09:19,420 --> 01:09:21,100
Yeah,yeah,yeah,save our cub.

755
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:25,420
I know where is the entrance.

756
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:29,500
We are alright?

757
01:09:29,500 --> 01:09:32,300
It is flour!

758
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:33,620
This,this.

759
01:09:33,620 --> 01:09:39,092
They have been frightened out of their wits

760
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:41,300
why don't you surrender now!

761
01:09:41,300 --> 01:09:42,420
Right,right,

762
01:09:42,420 --> 01:09:46,300
see how powerful I am,surrender now!

763
01:09:46,300 --> 01:09:49,820
Can you see it?

764
01:09:49,820 --> 01:09:51,220
Why aren't you scared?

765
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:52,900
Hey,don't come close...

766
01:09:52,900 --> 01:09:54,700
I only try to scare you

767
01:09:54,700 --> 01:09:55,420
If you take another step,

768
01:09:55,420 --> 01:10:00,892
I will have to reason with you!

769
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:04,220
Oops,time to scam I see.

770
01:10:04,220 --> 01:10:05,220
Ha,ha,what?

771
01:10:05,220 --> 01:10:08,900
Can't I reason with you with a piece of stone?

772
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:12,100
As you said,we will meet again!

773
01:10:12,100 --> 01:10:13,620
It is not my fault

774
01:10:13,620 --> 01:10:15,620
These two bad guys forced met to

775
01:10:15,620 --> 01:10:18,220
do all the wicked things!

776
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:19,500
It's his idea to destroy

777
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:22,220
your village to build the amusement park.

778
01:10:22,220 --> 01:10:27,692
I am innocent. They are responsible.

779
01:10:28,900 --> 01:10:33,300
How to open it?

780
01:10:33,300 --> 01:10:38,818
Ouch! Help,Lance is also down below!

781
01:11:14,220 --> 01:11:15,820
My sweetie!

782
01:11:15,820 --> 01:11:19,300
Where are you?

783
01:11:19,300 --> 01:11:21,500
Lance!

784
01:11:21,500 --> 01:11:24,420
Howie! My sweetie!

785
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:29,892
Lance!

786
01:11:34,900 --> 01:11:39,220
Sweetie!

787
01:11:39,220 --> 01:11:44,692
Sweetie! Daddy is here to save you!

788
01:11:54,420 --> 01:11:59,892
Ha,ha. This grass is good for barbecue.

789
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:04,900
Howie!

790
01:12:04,900 --> 01:12:09,500
Mommy? Mommy!

791
01:12:09,500 --> 01:12:12,220
Mommy! Come here to meet my adopted brother!

792
01:12:12,220 --> 01:12:15,620
Adopted brother?

793
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:17,820
This is my adopted brother!

794
01:12:17,820 --> 01:12:19,500
Oh?This is Big Brother!

795
01:12:19,500 --> 01:12:21,700
Hi

796
01:12:21,700 --> 01:12:23,620
Big Brother?

797
01:12:23,620 --> 01:12:26,820
It can't be true?

798
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:28,100
What?

799
01:12:28,100 --> 01:12:33,620
Any problems?

800
01:12:33,620 --> 01:12:35,500
What is happening?

801
01:12:35,500 --> 01:12:41,018
Get out quickly!

802
01:13:09,300 --> 01:13:11,220
Ha,ha,we finally find the real

803
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:16,692
emerald power source!

804
01:13:22,700 --> 01:13:28,218
Village Chief,isn't this grass similar to yours?

805
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:33,700
I am happy for the perfect ending.

806
01:13:33,700 --> 01:13:39,218
Tigbot King is now perfect!

807
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:43,220
Counselor!

808
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:48,692
Counselor,I want to expand my Amusement Park.

809
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:55,500
What Amusement Park?

810
01:13:55,500 --> 01:13:59,500
I want to recreate the primordial era.

811
01:13:59,500 --> 01:14:01,900
Looks like they are having
some form of internal conflict?

812
01:14:01,900 --> 01:14:04,740
Who is really Lord Japper?

813
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:06,060
Nonsense!

814
01:14:06,060 --> 01:14:09,260
I am Lord Japper of all times!

815
01:14:09,260 --> 01:14:11,540
Such a mighty fool!

816
01:14:11,540 --> 01:14:12,940
Lord Japper?

817
01:14:12,940 --> 01:14:16,740
You are nothing but an overgrown cat.

818
01:14:16,740 --> 01:14:18,940
A cat?

819
01:14:18,940 --> 01:14:19,940
Yes,because in the Tiger Year,

820
01:14:19,940 --> 01:14:22,740
the tiger heads of the animal zodiac .

821
01:14:22,740 --> 01:14:24,060
I only use you to obtain the demolition

822
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:25,860
and resettlement permit.

823
01:14:25,860 --> 01:14:27,460
Now that I have gotten what I want

824
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:29,460
I do not need to deceive you anymore.

825
01:14:29,460 --> 01:14:30,660
It is impossible!

826
01:14:30,660 --> 01:14:32,060
I am a tiger!

827
01:14:32,060 --> 01:14:33,460
I am head of the zodiac!

828
01:14:33,460 --> 01:14:38,940
I am Lord Japper!

829
01:14:38,940 --> 01:14:43,540
Destroy Tigbot King

830
01:14:43,540 --> 01:14:49,058
Ridiculous!

831
01:14:49,340 --> 01:14:54,340
Or someone's getting cold feet.

832
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:56,060
Wh- What's going on?

833
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:58,260
I dominate everything here!

834
01:14:58,260 --> 01:14:59,860
Don't waste your time.

835
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:04,460
If you don't believe me,call out loud.

836
01:15:04,460 --> 01:15:06,940
Miao

837
01:15:06,940 --> 01:15:09,460
You have been lying to me since I was young?

838
01:15:09,460 --> 01:15:11,940
I am a cat?

839
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:13,060
Wow!~~

840
01:15:13,060 --> 01:15:15,540
Why are you rejoicing?

841
01:15:15,540 --> 01:15:18,060
Wash your face and look yourself in the mirror.

842
01:15:18,060 --> 01:15:23,532
And find out what are you!

843
01:15:32,260 --> 01:15:36,460
Village Chief,what's this all about?

844
01:15:36,460 --> 01:15:41,932
Apparently,he is a hyena.

845
01:15:43,540 --> 01:15:47,740
This is a cat,this is a hyena.

846
01:15:47,740 --> 01:15:51,860
Are you a fake too?

847
01:15:51,860 --> 01:15:55,060
Right,I am not a gecko

848
01:15:55,060 --> 01:16:00,532
But a noble dinosaur! Check this out.

849
01:16:08,940 --> 01:16:11,860
Are you a dwarf?

850
01:16:11,860 --> 01:16:14,140
Hm,because of this environment

851
01:16:14,140 --> 01:16:19,658
I have become what I am now! Ha,ha.

852
01:16:20,260 --> 01:16:22,460
After destroying all existing vegetation

853
01:16:22,460 --> 01:16:23,140
I can recreate the environment of a long-gone era

854
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:25,660
which is most suitable for me.

855
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:28,340
At that time,our species
were huge noble dinosaurs.

856
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:33,140
I can evolve to be like them!

857
01:16:33,140 --> 01:16:35,060
Destroy this place,Tigbot King!

858
01:16:35,060 --> 01:16:40,532
I want to recreate the primordial era!

859
01:16:41,740 --> 01:16:47,258
Let's scatter!

860
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:05,140
What can we do to stop him,Honey?

861
01:17:05,140 --> 01:17:07,940
Isn't it nonsensical! No!!

862
01:17:07,940 --> 01:17:13,458
OK,we know what to do now!

863
01:17:13,540 --> 01:17:16,740
We want to be on your side again.

864
01:17:16,740 --> 01:17:19,260
Why make this choice now...

865
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:21,460
I won't allow all of you to defect.

866
01:17:21,460 --> 01:17:26,932
I am exiling all of you to the desert!

867
01:17:30,940 --> 01:17:33,540
He doesn't look like he
is going to fight any more.

868
01:17:33,540 --> 01:17:35,060
Being soft-hearted again?

869
01:17:35,060 --> 01:17:40,532
I hope he is not unleashing his secret weapon.

870
01:17:42,540 --> 01:17:48,058
Look out for my super Tigbot King!!

871
01:17:57,540 --> 01:18:03,058
Hold tight,Honey!

872
01:18:03,940 --> 01:18:06,060
Wah,not again?

873
01:18:06,060 --> 01:18:11,532
All of you are exiled.

874
01:18:18,660 --> 01:18:23,860
Who have any weapons,hurl them at him!

875
01:18:23,860 --> 01:18:29,332
Come on,Hollie,use your frying pan!

876
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:35,732
Charge!

877
01:18:35,860 --> 01:18:37,460
How come you were so accurate

878
01:18:37,460 --> 01:18:39,660
when you hitting meHow c,Honey?

879
01:18:39,660 --> 01:18:44,740
Aren't you the only one that I have ever hit?

880
01:18:44,740 --> 01:18:47,660
He,he. Hollie,just aim at Wolffy!

881
01:18:47,660 --> 01:18:51,660
Happy! How can you suggest that!

882
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:54,460
Trust me!

883
01:18:54,460 --> 01:18:56,740
Wolffy,you didn't tell your wife

884
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:59,340
that you had had an egg,right?

885
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:01,460
What? You ate it all by yourself,

886
01:19:01,460 --> 01:19:03,460
leaving your wife and child starving?

887
01:19:03,460 --> 01:19:04,940
No ...I didn't...

888
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:10,458
Where is the egg?

889
01:19:14,540 --> 01:19:16,340
Good Shot.

890
01:19:16,340 --> 01:19:19,260
Happy!,You set me up again.

891
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:24,732
Wolffy,jump up and dodge!

892
01:19:26,260 --> 01:19:27,460
Wolffy cooked the egg

893
01:19:27,460 --> 01:19:29,940
in eight different ways.

894
01:19:29,940 --> 01:19:31,340
Oh,there goes my family!

895
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:32,740
Eight different ways to cook the egg?

896
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:37,860
Take this!

897
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:43,332
Oh dear,the controller is damaged!

898
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:48,540
If you didn't eat the egg,why are you hiding?

899
01:19:48,540 --> 01:19:50,860
Happy,I hate you.

900
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:53,140
Eight different ways of cooking the egg,

901
01:19:53,140 --> 01:19:56,340
take this and this!

902
01:19:56,340 --> 01:19:57,860
Wah,help!

903
01:19:57,860 --> 01:20:02,060
Oh,this is the Tiger Year's
first miscarriage of justice.

904
01:20:02,060 --> 01:20:07,532
You dare to claim you are innocent!

905
01:20:07,860 --> 01:20:13,332
No one can defeat a two-pan strike!

906
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:38,940
Wah~~~

907
01:20:38,940 --> 01:20:44,458
Ouch!!

908
01:20:51,140 --> 01:20:54,260
Mission accomplished.

909
01:20:54,260 --> 01:20:56,460
I am now the one

910
01:20:56,460 --> 01:21:00,060
and only Lord of the grassland!

911
01:21:00,060 --> 01:21:03,260
What else did you eat?

912
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:08,732
Honey! No,I didn't,honey!

913
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:15,060
Cousin,bite them to death!

914
01:21:15,060 --> 01:21:16,740
Cousin?

915
01:21:16,740 --> 01:21:19,740
Bite them to death!

916
01:21:19,740 --> 01:21:22,660
Get out of my way!

917
01:21:22,660 --> 01:21:28,178
I will deal with him!

918
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:38,700
Good,let's go and play somewhere else!

919
01:21:38,700 --> 01:21:42,700
Cousin,when did you become a vegetarian?

920
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:45,380
Dinosaurs evolved to be vegetarians

921
01:21:45,380 --> 01:21:48,100
because of environmental changes...

922
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:51,700
Don't you know that?

923
01:21:51,700 --> 01:21:54,100
Evolution can't be retrogressive

924
01:21:54,100 --> 01:21:58,380
It is impossible to return to the Jurassic period.

925
01:21:58,380 --> 01:22:00,580
Regretfully I have to admit defeat,

926
01:22:00,580 --> 01:22:03,780
what is on your mind?

927
01:22:03,780 --> 01:22:06,300
Let me have your address.

928
01:22:06,300 --> 01:22:07,580
I want to convert your house into

929
01:22:07,580 --> 01:22:13,098
a public toilet.

930
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:28,780
I give you two choices

931
01:22:28,780 --> 01:22:29,980
First,spare us.

932
01:22:29,980 --> 01:22:31,900
Second,release us.

933
01:22:31,900 --> 01:22:33,180
All of you are civilized

934
01:22:33,180 --> 01:22:34,700
please let us go and release us?

935
01:22:34,700 --> 01:22:38,980
Wang!~~

936
01:22:38,980 --> 01:22:41,980
Gecko! Your days are numbered!

937
01:22:41,980 --> 01:22:46,900
I want a way out too,and not to learn math!

938
01:22:46,900 --> 01:22:52,372
How dare you make fun of what my wife said!

939
01:22:57,780 --> 01:23:02,780
Wait!

940
01:23:02,780 --> 01:23:06,980
Listen,I have deciphered
the secret of the Totem.

941
01:23:06,980 --> 01:23:10,300
Hey,old chap,are you invincible now?

942
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:14,180
Village Chief,share the secret with them!

943
01:23:14,180 --> 01:23:17,300
I have been experimenting with it for sometime.

944
01:23:17,300 --> 01:23:22,772
Finally I have unraveled the mystery.

945
01:23:31,100 --> 01:23:33,700
Looks like a family photo..

946
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:38,100
Yes,the family tree of life on Earth,look...

947
01:23:38,100 --> 01:23:41,100
See,this is the wolf,tiger,elephant,

948
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:43,380
cat,canines,and sheep.

949
01:23:43,380 --> 01:23:45,180
All of them are mammals

950
01:23:45,180 --> 01:23:49,100
they evolved from reptiles

951
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:51,500
What? This gecko is our ancestor?

952
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:53,380
Don't interrupt!

953
01:23:53,380 --> 01:23:57,580
And their ancestors were amphibians,

954
01:23:57,580 --> 01:24:03,098
then fishes,then...

955
01:24:03,700 --> 01:24:05,180
Village chief,can you be more direct,

956
01:24:05,180 --> 01:24:06,700
what's this?

957
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:12,172
This is a single-cell organism.

958
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:16,900
Old Sheeep,what exactly is your point?

959
01:24:16,900 --> 01:24:21,300
Ha,ha,we are actually related to each other.

960
01:24:21,300 --> 01:24:24,300
Yesterday they came here
to tear down our houses

961
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:26,780
And today we are making them suffered,

962
01:24:26,780 --> 01:24:30,180
Isn't it ridiculous?

963
01:24:30,180 --> 01:24:33,980
Ridiculous,ridiculous!

964
01:24:33,980 --> 01:24:37,900
What kind Totem is this,
and how can it be invincible?

965
01:24:37,900 --> 01:24:40,180
As long as we are not enemies

966
01:24:40,180 --> 01:24:43,180
Aren't we invincible. Can you figure this out!

967
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:48,698
Ha,ha,ha,ha...

968
01:24:56,300 --> 01:25:01,772
Dear friends,smile...

969
01:25:04,780 --> 01:25:06,100
Wolffy,can you promise that

970
01:25:06,100 --> 01:25:08,380
we will remain friends in the future.

971
01:25:08,380 --> 01:25:09,380
If we are friends,then you should

972
01:25:09,380 --> 01:25:14,898
not let your friends be hungry.

973
01:25:17,580 --> 01:25:19,380
Happy is missing!

974
01:25:19,380 --> 01:25:20,580
Happy,you deserved to be eaten.

975
01:25:20,580 --> 01:25:21,780
Come out to face me.

976
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:27,298
OK!

977
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:32,500
Is everyone alright?

978
01:25:32,500 --> 01:25:34,580
I have modified Tigbot King

979
01:25:34,580 --> 01:25:39,580
to serve us now.

980
01:25:39,580 --> 01:25:41,180
Relax,my friend!

981
01:25:41,180 --> 01:25:44,100
Happy New Year. I am returning the egg to you!

982
01:25:44,100 --> 01:25:45,900
Honey,I saved the egg

983
01:25:45,900 --> 01:25:48,980
for you and Howie!

984
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:51,180
One is not enough,I want more!

985
01:25:51,180 --> 01:25:53,900
Honey...

986
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:55,900
I shall return!

987
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:58,100
Daddy is flying again!

988
01:25:58,100 --> 01:26:03,572
Ha,ha,ha,ha!

989
01:28:09,274 --> 01:28:13,337
