2
00:03:51,042 --> 00:03:52,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Two years ago,

3
00:03:52,375 --> 00:03:56,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Superintendent Hong Do Heng  of CIB was murdered.

4
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}To protect his undercover agents,

5
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:02,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}he deleted their files from  his computer before he was killed.

6
00:04:02,542 --> 00:04:04,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}And the Police lost contact  with the agents.

7
00:04:04,667 --> 00:04:07,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}When the Police recovered the files,

8
00:04:07,042 --> 00:04:08,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}they started to track down  the agents on the field

9
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:12,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}until everyone has been accounted for.

10
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:30,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Out of the way!

11
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Not again!

12
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Go home!

13
00:04:41,042 --> 00:04:42,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Sorry...

14
00:04:42,292 --> 00:04:43,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Move aside!

15
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:54,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Lunatic!

16
00:05:24,792 --> 00:05:26,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Get in!

17
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I'm stuck!

18
00:05:35,792 --> 00:05:37,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Are you done yet?

19
00:05:37,417 --> 00:05:38,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Will you hurry up?

20
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I can't explain this at  the roadblock up ahead.

21
00:05:46,417 --> 00:05:49,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You said the job was not dangerous.  I almost died!

22
00:05:50,292 --> 00:05:51,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I never said that.

23
00:05:52,042 --> 00:05:54,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I said it's not too dangerous.

24
00:05:54,417 --> 00:05:58,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}If you can't hear,  how can you be an undercover?

25
00:05:58,292 --> 00:05:59,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}If you're not happy,

26
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:00,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}we should break up.

27
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:02,208
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}- What did you say?  - Break up!

28
00:06:02,542 --> 00:06:03,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What?

29
00:06:04,542 --> 00:06:06,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Break up!

30
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:07,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Break up!

31
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}No need. I'll screen you out.

32
00:06:09,542 --> 00:06:10,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}No need to get huffy.

33
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Thank God!

34
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:16,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Godfather is watching out for me.

35
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Or I'd be dead by now.

36
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:19,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Godfather,

37
00:06:20,125 --> 00:06:21,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I'll offer you joss sticks when I go home.

38
00:06:21,292 --> 00:06:24,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I want extra loading after this.

39
00:06:26,542 --> 00:06:29,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}- Why is that?  - I'm risking my life!

40
00:06:29,167 --> 00:06:30,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You're not the only one.

41
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Give that back!

42
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:37,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I hurt my butt.

43
00:06:37,667 --> 00:06:39,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I deserve extra loading.

44
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:45,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What would a crab say to a crab stick?

45
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What?

46
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:48,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Quit your act!

47
00:06:49,292 --> 00:06:50,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What line of work are you in?

48
00:06:50,667 --> 00:06:52,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}It's part of the package.  I can't write in the report

49
00:06:52,917 --> 00:06:56,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}you need loading because  you scraped your butt?

50
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}More junk mail!

51
00:07:07,292 --> 00:07:09,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Hong's code?

52
00:07:11,542 --> 00:07:12,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What is that?

53
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}(Have been looking for you)

54
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:21,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Hong's secret code.

55
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:24,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Find out who he is.

56
00:07:25,292 --> 00:07:27,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}(Who are you?)

57
00:07:33,917 --> 00:07:37,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}He said he's Blackjack,  one of Hong's agents,

58
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:43,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}and that there's no

59
00:07:43,292 --> 00:07:45,000

60
00:07:45,042 --> 00:07:47,542

61
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:49,375

62
00:07:51,792 --> 00:07:53,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}That means someone is still missing.

82
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:09,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I won't. Only you know the code.

88
00:10:34,042 --> 00:10:37,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Can be an object or a lead.

89
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Don't overlook any details.

90
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I.T. confirmed Hong had

92

98
00:11:56,042 --> 00:11:57,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What happened?

99
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Don't push! I'm pregnant!

100
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Are you OK? Can someone answer me?

101

{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}The parachute is a gift.

102
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Pick one of the two buttons.

103

{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Blue...

104
00:12:34,792 --> 00:12:36,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}No, better choose red.

105
00:12:46,792 --> 00:12:50,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I picked blue.

106
00:12:52,917 --> 00:12:54,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Fine!

107
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:21,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Call my phone. Take over the control car.

111
00:13:47,542 --> 00:13:49,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You didn't tell me you changed your plan.

112
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:50,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Are you affected?

113
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Not really.

114

116
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:01,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}The chicks will show up if I pay them.

117
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:04,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}My dad's new secretary is a knockout.

118
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Tell her to be here or she's fired.

119
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:07,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Park the car.

120

00:14:43,417 --> 00:14:45,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Team D, 9 o'clock. Intercept him!

128
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Yes, Sir!

129
00:15:08,542 --> 00:15:10,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Suspect heading west on Connaught Road.

130
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:20,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Looks like someone wants to appeal.

131
00:15:20,417 --> 00:15:21,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What's the bet?

132
00:15:21,292 --> 00:15:22,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}All in!

133
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:23,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}All in?

134
00:15:53,417 --> 00:15:55,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}The cop is aggressive.

135
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:57,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Luckily I have a contingency plan.

136
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:28,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}All in.

137
00:16:28,292 --> 00:16:30,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}My money is on you to win. Pay up!

138
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Where did you get this?

139
00:16:31,917 --> 00:16:33,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Lifted it from Lam Tung Yau.

140
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}After I sell it, I'll buy you abalones.

141
00:16:36,292 --> 00:16:37,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Not interested.

142
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:39,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}How about your favorite Ultraman toy?

143
00:16:39,542 --> 00:16:40,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I'll bid one for you online.

144
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Only because you begged me.

145
00:16:42,542 --> 00:16:44,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}This one is OK.

146
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:51,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Thank you.

147
00:16:52,167 --> 00:16:53,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}No wonder you're in management.

148
00:16:53,542 --> 00:16:55,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You had to do the job yourself.

149
00:16:55,167 --> 00:16:57,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}See? You're in the spotlight.

150
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}It's included in my salary.

151
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}That reminds me...

152
00:17:02,167 --> 00:17:04,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I told you the wiring gear was not ready,

153
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}but you played with it anyway.

154
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:07,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Luckily you gave him the parachute.

155
00:17:07,542 --> 00:17:08,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I haven't tried it myself.

156
00:17:08,667 --> 00:17:10,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You could have died.

157
00:17:13,917 --> 00:17:17,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Here's your share. Buy yourself a toy.

158
00:17:18,417 --> 00:17:20,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What's this?

159
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:20,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Rent?

160
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:21,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Who's counting now?

161
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:22,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Give it back!

162
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You really can't resist tooting  your own horn.

163
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Don't be so petty!

164
00:17:28,167 --> 00:17:30,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Boss! Master Shiu!  Mr. Kwok called a meeting.

165
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Let's go.

166
00:17:33,542 --> 00:17:35,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}But we have to eat first.

167
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}We'll show up 2 hours later.

168
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Grab my jacket, OK? Thanks.

169
00:18:08,917 --> 00:18:10,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Who did this?

170
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:11,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You're busy.

171
00:18:11,917 --> 00:18:13,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Just finish it. It's a small bowl.

172
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}We're in a hurry.

173
00:18:18,042 --> 00:18:19,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Want some coffee?

174
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Goodd idea!

175
00:18:21,417 --> 00:18:23,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Siu Ying, get us some coffee.

176
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}OK!

177
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:45,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Who the hell are you?

178
00:18:49,542 --> 00:18:51,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Go get some coffee. I'll be right with you.

179
00:18:52,167 --> 00:18:53,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Siu Ying, call me after the meeting.

180
00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:54,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}OK!

181
00:18:57,542 --> 00:19:00,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Give him a big hand for the flying trapeze.

182
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:02,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You want an applause? There you have it.

183
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:05,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Scoot over!

184
00:19:06,542 --> 00:19:07,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You want an applause?

185
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Or get arrested?

186
00:19:09,292 --> 00:19:11,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Sorry I'm late.

187
00:19:11,917 --> 00:19:15,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Now that the cops are onto us,

188
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:18,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}we're making a lot less money.

189
00:19:19,792 --> 00:19:22,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Originally, I prepared a report for you.

190
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}But I guess you're not interested.

191
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:28,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Let me give you the gist of it.

192
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:33,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}The cops never messed with us  for over 3 months.

193
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:36,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Assume we have zero income for 3 months,

194
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:38,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}even counting all the overhead,

195
00:19:39,667 --> 00:19:43,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}it comes to 2% of the profits

196
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:46,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I made for the company in the past 3 years.

197
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}The amount is so small,  I won't bother with the details.

198
00:19:49,667 --> 00:19:51,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Any questions?

199
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:54,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}It was so fucking unnecessary.

200
00:19:54,667 --> 00:19:56,583
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Just kidnap Lam Tung Yau's

201
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:57,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}wife and son.

202
00:19:57,833 --> 00:19:58,958
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Why bother with this?

203
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Times are different now.

204
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:04,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}We should do our part

205
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:08,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}and help the Police maintain law and order.

206
00:20:08,917 --> 00:20:10,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}The key is

207
00:20:10,917 --> 00:20:15,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}to shut down Lam Tung Yau's business  as soon as it opens.

208
00:20:16,917 --> 00:20:20,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}He wouldn't dare tread on our turf again.

209
00:20:20,292 --> 00:20:23,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Good job, Lam.

210
00:20:23,667 --> 00:20:25,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I should get going.

211
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:26,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Call me if you need me.

212
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Meeting is adjourned!

213
00:20:39,292 --> 00:20:41,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Hello, Mr. Tung!

214
00:20:42,167 --> 00:20:43,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Ming,

215
00:20:43,292 --> 00:20:47,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}no wonder you told me  to sell short on Tung's stocks.

216
00:20:47,167 --> 00:20:50,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}The stock price plunged like the waterfall.

217
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:53,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I gained back what he conned from me

218
00:20:53,542 --> 00:20:55,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}and a few times over.

219
00:20:56,042 --> 00:20:57,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}About the plan...

220
00:20:57,542 --> 00:21:00,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I know Lam was the mastermind.

221
00:21:00,542 --> 00:21:01,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}He has guts and wits.

222
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:02,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I'm impressed.

223
00:21:02,792 --> 00:21:03,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Right...

224
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Now I know who  to send to Brazil for the deal.

225
00:21:06,167 --> 00:21:07,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Send Lam.

226
00:21:07,042 --> 00:21:08,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I have confidence in him.

227
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I know the old fossils will give you hell.

228
00:21:23,042 --> 00:21:26,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Those who are unproductive always complain.

229
00:21:28,167 --> 00:21:30,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I have it all planned out.

230
00:21:30,292 --> 00:21:33,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}But the cops showed up after just 1 minute.

231
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:36,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You suppose we have a mole among us?

232
00:21:56,417 --> 00:21:57,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}After you.

233
00:21:57,875 --> 00:21:58,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What about the mole?

234
00:21:59,417 --> 00:22:00,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Go!

235
00:22:00,792 --> 00:22:03,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Make sure you don't call me lazy.

236
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}The arm came off.

237
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Fix it.

238
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:21,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Inspector Q,

239
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:24,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Lam Tung Yau wants a piece

240
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:26,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}of Tak Mou's drug business.

241
00:22:26,792 --> 00:22:29,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}We think someone  wants to teach him a lesson.

242
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:32,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}OCTB brought them in for questioning.

243
00:22:35,250 --> 00:22:38,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Where were you last night  between 7 and 10p.m.?

244
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:43,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Working out at the company gym.

245
00:22:43,292 --> 00:22:45,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}At night?

246
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}No offense,

247
00:22:48,875 --> 00:22:51,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}but if you're higher up on  the corporate ladder,

248
00:22:51,167 --> 00:22:53,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}you'll realize

249
00:22:53,167 --> 00:22:54,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}it's not that unusual.

250
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:56,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Who can testify for you?

251
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:57,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Fai...

252
00:22:58,792 --> 00:23:00,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}This is Inspector Q from CIB.

253
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:03,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Don't talk to him like he's a punk.

254
00:23:03,875 --> 00:23:06,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}The guy in the suit wants respect

255
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:08,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}because he thinks he's educated.

256
00:23:08,125 --> 00:23:09,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Be polite.

257
00:23:09,875 --> 00:23:12,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Make him feel good about himself.  Then you make him talk.

258
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:16,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Of course, you're the boss.

259
00:23:16,042 --> 00:23:17,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You can work out any time you like.

260
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Yes, butter up to him.

261
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:21,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Let it go to his head.

262
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:23,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}He's praising you?

263
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:28,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}HKU? You must be very smart.

264
00:23:29,167 --> 00:23:31,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Ask him what he did after graduation.

265
00:23:31,042 --> 00:23:34,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You dropped out, but you had good grades.

266
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:37,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What did you do for a living?

267
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:39,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Sightseeing.

268
00:23:40,167 --> 00:23:41,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Don't you have any say?

269
00:23:41,542 --> 00:23:43,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}He's going in circles.  He's hiding something.

270
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:45,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Keep digging.

271
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:47,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What was your first job?

272
00:23:47,417 --> 00:23:49,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You're busy listening and asking questions.

273
00:23:49,917 --> 00:23:51,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Let him do the asking.

274
00:23:58,667 --> 00:24:00,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I'm sorry, Mr. Lam.

275
00:24:00,042 --> 00:24:01,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I've been so busy today  I haven't had lunch.

276
00:24:01,917 --> 00:24:03,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}So my colleagues filled in for me.

277
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Wow, you have an IQ of 140.

278
00:24:06,042 --> 00:24:09,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}But you seem to have trouble  making conversation.

279
00:24:09,667 --> 00:24:11,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You're not answering the questions.

280
00:24:13,042 --> 00:24:14,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}CIB?

281
00:24:14,917 --> 00:24:17,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}A nosy bastard!

282
00:24:17,375 --> 00:24:18,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}He's out of line,

283
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:20,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}doing OCTB's job.

284
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:23,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You must be an asshole.

285
00:24:23,292 --> 00:24:25,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Bingo!

286
00:24:25,167 --> 00:24:26,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I am an asshole.

287
00:24:26,417 --> 00:24:27,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}But we're just doing our jobs.

288
00:24:28,042 --> 00:24:31,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Helping each other out, like a family.

289
00:24:31,292 --> 00:24:34,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Unlike the criminals who pass the buck.

290
00:24:35,625 --> 00:24:37,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}It's actually very simple.

291
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Work with us, confess

292
00:24:38,917 --> 00:24:40,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}and we all go home on time.

293
00:24:42,167 --> 00:24:42,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Are you shitting me?

294
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Through a two-way mirror

295
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}and an earpiece, you ask a few questions

296
00:24:48,917 --> 00:24:50,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}and you can crack the case?

297
00:24:51,167 --> 00:24:53,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Don't be so lazy!

298
00:24:53,125 --> 00:24:56,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You ruined the reputation of  all civil servants!

299
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:58,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Folks, you heard the taxpayer's complaint.

300
00:24:58,875 --> 00:24:59,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Let's be more positive.

301
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:02,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Tell everyone to get more paper.

302
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Whenever Mr. Lam decides to cooperate,

303
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:05,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}fill up those notepads and send him home.

304
00:25:05,875 --> 00:25:07,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I'm taking off. See you tomorrow.

305
00:25:10,042 --> 00:25:12,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}When you first started to question me,

306
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:15,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}and I was doing this,

307
00:25:15,958 --> 00:25:18,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}did you notice

308
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:22,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I projected a certain mood?

309
00:25:24,292 --> 00:25:25,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Never mind. Carry on.

310
00:25:28,917 --> 00:25:31,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Come over to Mui Kee.

311
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:53,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Happy birthday to you...

312
00:25:54,542 --> 00:25:56,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Thank you...

313
00:26:00,667 --> 00:26:01,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Thank you...

314
00:26:01,917 --> 00:26:07,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Here's to your health and smile!

315
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:08,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Give Uncle a kiss.

316
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Why am I an uncle?

317
00:26:10,792 --> 00:26:13,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Go kiss the kid.

318
00:26:13,167 --> 00:26:15,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Why? Are you shy?

319
00:26:15,792 --> 00:26:17,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I knew it.

320
00:26:17,667 --> 00:26:20,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I'm going to China soon  and won't be around.

321
00:26:20,667 --> 00:26:22,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Since it's your birthday,  we should celebrate,

322
00:26:22,417 --> 00:26:24,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}and you can see Mandy.

323
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:27,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Then why didn't they bury you  when you were born?

324
00:26:28,792 --> 00:26:30,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Mandy, it's late.

325
00:26:30,542 --> 00:26:31,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You should be in bed.

326
00:26:31,292 --> 00:26:33,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Or you won't grow up to be a K-pop star.

327
00:26:33,375 --> 00:26:34,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You want to be a K-pop star?

328
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:36,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You like kam-sa-ham-nida?

329
00:26:36,167 --> 00:26:37,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I just doggy-bagged some abalones.

330
00:26:37,917 --> 00:26:39,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Finish them before you go to bed.

331
00:26:39,042 --> 00:26:39,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}- OK.  - Auntie Mui...

332
00:26:39,792 --> 00:26:40,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Yeah!

333
00:26:40,917 --> 00:26:41,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Give me a hug.

334
00:26:41,917 --> 00:26:43,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Here... have some soup.

335
00:26:44,792 --> 00:26:46,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Give me a kiss.

336
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:53,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Why don't you let her be your godchild?

337
00:26:55,917 --> 00:26:57,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Don't you like her?

338
00:26:58,792 --> 00:27:03,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I do. I plan to marry her  when she grows up.

339
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:08,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Guess what my birthday wish is this year.

340
00:27:08,792 --> 00:27:10,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I want to go to Brazil.

341
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:15,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}To learn the samba?

342
00:27:16,625 --> 00:27:17,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Well?

343
00:27:26,167 --> 00:27:27,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Boss!

344
00:27:57,042 --> 00:27:58,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Boss!

345
00:27:58,417 --> 00:27:59,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}They're coming. Run!

346
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Why did you come back?

347
00:28:01,542 --> 00:28:03,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I'm the Boss. I can't abandon you.

348
00:28:03,417 --> 00:28:05,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Run! This massage parlor is not safe.

349
00:28:06,917 --> 00:28:09,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Without your help back then,

350
00:28:10,042 --> 00:28:11,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I think

351
00:28:11,542 --> 00:28:13,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I'm probably still working for you now.

352
00:28:14,542 --> 00:28:15,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Don't say that!

353
00:28:17,792 --> 00:28:20,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}But when it comes to drugs,

354
00:28:21,792 --> 00:28:22,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I can't make any promises.

355
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You'll hurt my feelings  if you keep talking.

356
00:28:37,292 --> 00:28:38,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Cheers!

357
00:28:38,417 --> 00:28:42,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I have a magic trick for your birthday.

358
00:28:43,292 --> 00:28:44,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Again?

359
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Cheers!

360
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}That's it!

361
00:29:08,667 --> 00:29:11,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}If only the car was slower...

362
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Watch it again.

363
00:29:13,167 --> 00:29:14,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Yes, Sir!

364
00:29:15,542 --> 00:29:16,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Well?

365
00:29:16,125 --> 00:29:18,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Got another message from Blackjack.

366
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What did he say?

367
00:29:19,042 --> 00:29:21,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}In an hour at 1400.

368
00:29:21,417 --> 00:29:22,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I'm sending you the coordinates now.

369
00:29:22,417 --> 00:29:23,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}OK!

370
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Luke, check this out.

371
00:29:27,042 --> 00:29:28,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}On Estrada Flor de Lótus, Macau.

372
00:29:29,042 --> 00:29:30,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Tak Mou Group has a hotel there.

373
00:29:32,875 --> 00:29:34,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Get over there now.

374
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:38,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}In an hour? I won't make it.

375
00:29:38,667 --> 00:29:40,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}They don't want you to call backup.

376
00:29:40,917 --> 00:29:41,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Go now.

377
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:45,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I get seasick.

378
00:29:46,917 --> 00:29:49,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I'll personally throw in a big present, OK?

379
00:29:49,792 --> 00:29:53,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I'm still shaken up from last time.

380
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I guarantee it's huge... I mean super big.

381
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Can you hear me?

382
00:30:02,542 --> 00:30:04,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}(Macau, China)

383
00:30:16,792 --> 00:30:18,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Blackjack, I love you!

384
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:20,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Settle down, OK?

385
00:30:20,417 --> 00:30:22,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I'm getting into my character, OK?

386
00:30:22,167 --> 00:30:24,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Break up if you can't stand me.

387
00:30:24,792 --> 00:30:26,708
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Your dream will come true

388
00:30:26,750 --> 00:30:28,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}when we find Blackjack.

389
00:30:28,208 --> 00:30:29,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Come on, Blackjack...

390
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:31,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}show your face.

391
00:30:32,792 --> 00:30:34,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Here...

392
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:35,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}(The pool)?

393
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What pool?

394
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:37,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}T...

395
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:38,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What are you babbling?

396
00:30:39,167 --> 00:30:41,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}...back? What is that?

397
00:30:41,292 --> 00:30:43,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Change into your T-back and go to the pool.

398
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}On the double!

399
00:30:46,792 --> 00:30:48,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Are you shitting me?

400
00:30:51,792 --> 00:30:53,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Hey... are you wearing a dress?

401
00:30:53,667 --> 00:30:54,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Where's the T-back?

402
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:57,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I won't flash my fabulous behind for you.

403
00:30:57,542 --> 00:30:58,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}It's not about doing me a favor.

404
00:30:58,917 --> 00:31:00,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You have a job to do.

405
00:31:00,250 --> 00:31:02,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Blackjack wants T-back by the pool.

406
00:31:02,708 --> 00:31:03,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}He must have a reason.

407
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:04,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Play by ear.

408
00:31:11,917 --> 00:31:13,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}(Behind me)?

409
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:19,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Tea bag?

410
00:31:19,917 --> 00:31:22,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You can't tell tea bag from T-back?

411
00:31:22,542 --> 00:31:23,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}He screwed up, not me.

412
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:26,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I know the code backwards.  Who knows who he is?

413
00:31:41,167 --> 00:31:42,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I can be so charming...

414
00:31:42,792 --> 00:31:45,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}My charm is oozing out.

415
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Madam!

416
00:32:02,042 --> 00:32:03,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Please move.

417
00:32:10,917 --> 00:32:13,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Madam, he took off. Follow him.

418
00:32:20,792 --> 00:32:22,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}(See you in the casino)

419
00:32:22,417 --> 00:32:23,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}They have a casino?

420
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:25,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Chill...

421
00:32:31,292 --> 00:32:33,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Hey... get back to work!

422
00:32:34,667 --> 00:32:36,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Wait for me, I'll be back.

423
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Morse code?

424
00:32:45,542 --> 00:32:46,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I...

425
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:49,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}M...

426
00:32:52,542 --> 00:32:53,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}B...

427
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:57,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}J...

428
00:32:58,917 --> 00:33:00,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}(I am Blackjack.)

429
00:33:00,667 --> 00:33:01,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}It's really him.

430
00:33:07,917 --> 00:33:09,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Where did he go?

431
00:33:09,042 --> 00:33:11,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Find him! Hurry!

432
00:33:20,542 --> 00:33:22,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You've been staring at me long enough.

433
00:33:22,667 --> 00:33:24,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I like to look at good looking men.

434
00:33:24,292 --> 00:33:25,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Is that a crime?

435
00:33:29,667 --> 00:33:32,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}SM look in broad daylight?

436
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:33,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Have you tried it?

437
00:33:34,875 --> 00:33:35,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}The cramps?

438
00:33:35,625 --> 00:33:37,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What are you doing?

439
00:33:39,125 --> 00:33:40,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You're molesting me.

440
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Obviously.

441
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:45,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Should I let you carry on?

442
00:33:45,792 --> 00:33:46,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Yes, keep it up.

443
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:48,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Don't stop!

444
00:33:49,167 --> 00:33:49,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Yes!

445
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Don't stop!

446
00:33:52,667 --> 00:33:53,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I can't believe I went along with it

447
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}and let you molest me.

448
00:34:02,042 --> 00:34:03,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}More Morse code?

449
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:05,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You reek of plastic,

450
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}and you spread your legs too willingly.

451
00:34:08,042 --> 00:34:09,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You're too hard to swallow.

452
00:34:10,542 --> 00:34:11,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You're kidding!

453
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,708
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Is your butt enjoying it so much

454
00:34:13,750 --> 00:34:15,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}you didn't feel anything?

455
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:16,333
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Go after him!

456
00:34:16,375 --> 00:34:17,583
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Not in your life!

457
00:34:22,625 --> 00:34:23,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Room 3308?

458
00:34:24,042 --> 00:34:26,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Over that way!

459
00:34:26,417 --> 00:34:29,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Listen to me, my name is not Ding  if I don't triple the loading.

460
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Wrong room, Miss.

461
00:34:50,792 --> 00:34:55,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Inspector Q, the guy is a pervert.  He wants a threesome.

462
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:27,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What the hell?

463
00:35:28,542 --> 00:35:30,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Why did you stick your head out?

464
00:35:33,042 --> 00:35:36,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You little bitch! I'll kill you!

465
00:35:36,667 --> 00:35:37,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Forget it!

466
00:36:02,417 --> 00:36:04,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Stop it...

467
00:36:05,167 --> 00:36:05,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Stop!

468
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:19,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}(Shenzhen, China)

469
00:36:51,417 --> 00:36:52,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Run, Boss!

470
00:37:23,542 --> 00:37:24,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Run!

471
00:38:06,542 --> 00:38:08,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Lam, Shiu is injured.

472
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:10,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Take him back to Hong Kong.

473
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}It's been a long day.

474
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Boss, I have something to say.

475
00:38:24,042 --> 00:38:25,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}It's OK. What is it?

476
00:38:25,792 --> 00:38:28,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}We're not just your bodyguards.

477
00:38:28,292 --> 00:38:30,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You saved our lives.

478
00:38:31,292 --> 00:38:33,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Next time I tell you to run,

479
00:38:34,125 --> 00:38:35,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}you must listen.

480
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:45,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Very well.

481
00:39:02,625 --> 00:39:03,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Hello?

482
00:39:04,042 --> 00:39:06,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What took you so long?

483
00:39:06,167 --> 00:39:07,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Wrong number.

484
00:39:07,042 --> 00:39:07,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Hello?

485
00:39:08,375 --> 00:39:09,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You conned me to Macau.

486
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:12,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I thought I'd have a good time.

487
00:39:12,542 --> 00:39:13,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}But I almost died.

488
00:39:13,583 --> 00:39:15,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I have yet to draft a will.

489
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:20,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What for? You have no family.

490
00:39:21,042 --> 00:39:22,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What do you want to say?

491
00:39:22,750 --> 00:39:25,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Who'd be interested?

492
00:39:25,292 --> 00:39:26,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Nothing!

493
00:39:26,417 --> 00:39:28,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I won't tell you anything.

494
00:39:28,250 --> 00:39:29,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I'm not talking about what's on your mind.

495
00:39:29,792 --> 00:39:31,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I'm talking about funeral arrangements.

496
00:39:34,542 --> 00:39:36,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I don't care. I want more loading.

497
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:38,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Worker's compensation and medical expenses.

498
00:39:38,875 --> 00:39:40,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}No problem. Anything you want.

499
00:39:40,917 --> 00:39:42,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Seriously...

500
00:39:43,333 --> 00:39:45,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Text Blackjack

501
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:47,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}and set up a meeting tonight.

502
00:39:47,917 --> 00:39:49,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Any last words?

503
00:39:49,292 --> 00:39:52,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I still owe you a big present.

504
00:39:52,417 --> 00:39:54,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Thank you, OK?

505
00:39:56,042 --> 00:39:57,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}That's better!

506
00:39:59,792 --> 00:40:01,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Where to?

507
00:40:05,917 --> 00:40:09,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Not the massage parlor. We're screwed.

508
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:13,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}We're definitely screwed.

509
00:40:27,875 --> 00:40:28,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Damn!

510
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:12,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I just met her in Macau. What is it?

511
00:41:21,292 --> 00:41:23,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Here's her phone.

512
00:41:38,375 --> 00:41:39,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What's this?

513
00:41:41,792 --> 00:41:44,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Text Blackjack.

514
00:41:44,417 --> 00:41:46,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Set up a meeting tonight.

515
00:41:53,667 --> 00:41:55,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Promotion for my foot massage parlor.

516
00:41:57,792 --> 00:42:00,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Competition is tough.

517
00:42:00,250 --> 00:42:04,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I need ideas to keep my customers.

518
00:42:04,792 --> 00:42:07,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}It's a link to a 30% off coupon.

519
00:42:10,167 --> 00:42:12,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}There's nothing.

520
00:42:13,042 --> 00:42:15,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I made a typo, OK?

521
00:42:17,375 --> 00:42:20,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}There's probably no signal in here.

522
00:42:21,417 --> 00:42:24,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What's going on, pal?

523
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:29,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Let me go.

524
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}- Staying mad makes you ugly.  - I'm still mad.

525
00:43:16,542 --> 00:43:18,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Did you do this?

526
00:43:18,792 --> 00:43:21,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}No...

527
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Who ordered the hit on us?

528
00:43:54,542 --> 00:43:57,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You obviously don't know  the fate of a traitor.

529
00:44:03,542 --> 00:44:08,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Start talking or you'll bury  your family with you.

530
00:44:21,292 --> 00:44:23,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Now that you know it's a mistake,

531
00:44:24,292 --> 00:44:25,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}can I go now?

532
00:44:26,042 --> 00:44:28,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I checked the CCTV.

533
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:32,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}A man was following you at the casino.

534
00:44:33,375 --> 00:44:35,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}There's something fishy about you.

535
00:44:35,750 --> 00:44:39,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}People follow me all the time in Yaumatei.

536
00:44:39,417 --> 00:44:41,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Is it a crime to be popular?

537
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:45,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Please let me go.

538
00:44:45,917 --> 00:44:48,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You obviously made a mistake.

539
00:44:48,417 --> 00:44:50,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}No mistake.

540
00:44:50,167 --> 00:44:51,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Put it down.

541
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:16,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I know exactly who and what you are.

542
00:45:16,667 --> 00:45:18,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Hong Kong Police.

543
00:45:18,667 --> 00:45:20,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Undercover agent for CIB.

544
00:45:21,625 --> 00:45:23,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Ding Siu Ka.

545
00:45:30,875 --> 00:45:32,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Long time no see.

546
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:36,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Surprise!

547
00:45:38,792 --> 00:45:40,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Miss me?

548
00:45:44,292 --> 00:45:45,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Not me.

549
00:46:06,667 --> 00:46:07,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Brother Foon Hei.

550
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Mr. Kwok, $1B is a lot of money.

551
00:46:11,375 --> 00:46:13,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I want to know how big your appetite is.

552
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:15,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Sorry about this.

553
00:46:15,417 --> 00:46:17,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I followed you here after our meeting.

554
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:21,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I didn't expect to see my old acquaintance.

555
00:46:22,167 --> 00:46:23,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}How careless of you!

556
00:46:37,167 --> 00:46:38,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I can't believe

557
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:40,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I picked up a mole,

558
00:46:40,167 --> 00:46:41,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}of all people.

559
00:46:41,250 --> 00:46:42,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Kwok Ming didn't suspect you.

560
00:46:43,542 --> 00:46:45,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}He obviously ordered the hit.

561
00:46:45,250 --> 00:46:46,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I know.

562
00:46:47,125 --> 00:46:49,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}He's a petty man. Don't be such a show-off.

563
00:46:54,042 --> 00:46:55,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Did you suspect me?

564
00:46:57,167 --> 00:46:58,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}If there comes a day

565
00:46:59,667 --> 00:47:01,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I found out you betrayed me.

566
00:47:01,042 --> 00:47:02,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What do you want me to do?

567
00:47:05,792 --> 00:47:07,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}If there comes a day

568
00:47:07,417 --> 00:47:09,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I found out you're a mole.

569
00:47:09,167 --> 00:47:10,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What do you want me to do?

570
00:47:12,042 --> 00:47:13,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}We'll see.

571
00:47:15,292 --> 00:47:16,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Who is this Brother Foon Hei?

572
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:19,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}He used to be a major  drug dealer in Hong Kong.

573
00:47:19,542 --> 00:47:21,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Rumor has it he was dead.

574
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:24,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Someone saw him in Myanmar  in the past 6 months.

575
00:47:24,667 --> 00:47:28,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}He's tight with drug lords in SE Asia.

576
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:35,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Be careful in Brazil.

577
00:47:38,417 --> 00:47:39,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Gotta go!

578
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:02,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}(Handler wants to meet at 0200.)

579
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:20,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}How do you know about Ding?

580
00:48:21,542 --> 00:48:23,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Hong asked me to save her before.

581
00:48:26,792 --> 00:48:28,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You didn't show up  at the Tung Yau cocktail,

582
00:48:28,917 --> 00:48:31,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}and killers showed up in Macau.

583
00:48:33,917 --> 00:48:35,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}If you were in my shoes,

584
00:48:35,625 --> 00:48:37,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}what should I think about you?

585
00:48:37,167 --> 00:48:39,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I didn't know the Boss changed his plan.

586
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:42,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I also didn't know about the hit in Macau.

587
00:48:43,583 --> 00:48:45,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Why was there no

588
00:48:45,083 --> 00:48:46,583
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}new handler after Hong died?

589
00:48:47,167 --> 00:48:49,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}The Police gave up on me?

590
00:48:50,542 --> 00:48:54,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Your data file was damaged beyond repair.

591
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You can't prove anything you said.

592
00:49:08,125 --> 00:49:10,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Proving my identity is your job.

593
00:49:14,167 --> 00:49:16,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Where is Ding?

594
00:49:19,667 --> 00:49:21,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Where is she now?

595
00:49:27,292 --> 00:49:29,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Dead.

596
00:49:30,792 --> 00:49:33,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Chum Foon Hei shot her

597
00:49:33,167 --> 00:49:35,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}after Kwok Ming took her.

598
00:49:39,792 --> 00:49:41,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}It was my fault

599
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:44,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}she blew her cover.

600
00:49:45,750 --> 00:49:47,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I'm sorry.

601
00:49:59,542 --> 00:50:01,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What case were you on?

602
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:07,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Tak Mou Group.

603
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:10,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I'll be in touch with the dealers soon.

604
00:50:12,292 --> 00:50:16,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Remember these numbers. Call me.

605
00:50:17,375 --> 00:50:18,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Yes, Sir!

606
00:50:26,667 --> 00:50:28,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You suspect me?

607
00:50:30,792 --> 00:50:35,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}One is texting and the other  is reading at the same time.

608
00:50:36,250 --> 00:50:38,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}That's too much of a coincidence.

609
00:50:39,042 --> 00:50:40,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Even if Shiu is clean,

610
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:42,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}the girl looks suspicious.

611
00:50:43,375 --> 00:50:44,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Get rid of her.

612
00:51:28,167 --> 00:51:29,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}A guided massage tour?

613
00:51:39,542 --> 00:51:44,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}(Brazil)

614
00:51:55,125 --> 00:51:56,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Luke, what have you got?

615
00:51:57,417 --> 00:51:57,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Here...

616
00:51:58,167 --> 00:51:59,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}At 0920,

617
00:51:59,458 --> 00:52:01,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Shiu was taken from the parking lot.

618
00:52:01,208 --> 00:52:02,083
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Interestingly enough...

619
00:52:02,125 --> 00:52:05,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}at 0945, armed men broke into his flat.

620
00:52:06,167 --> 00:52:08,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Different parties!

621
00:52:08,417 --> 00:52:09,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What the hell?

622
00:52:28,542 --> 00:52:29,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Relax!

623
00:52:29,917 --> 00:52:31,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Just want something to drink!

624
00:52:31,125 --> 00:52:32,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}OK? Thank you.

625
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}(Held hostage in Brazil.  Will meet dealer, need backup)

626
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:52,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}(Stay on the phone, we'll find you.)

627
00:53:40,042 --> 00:53:41,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Who's paying for the massage?

628
00:53:42,042 --> 00:53:43,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Whoever gets out first.

629
00:54:07,542 --> 00:54:08,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Superintendent Wong.

630
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:09,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Any word from the Security Bureau?

631
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:10,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Yes.

632
00:54:10,667 --> 00:54:13,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}The Brazilian Police are still  locating the phone.

633
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:16,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}CIB undercover agents are often killed

634
00:54:16,167 --> 00:54:17,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}not because they're not good enough,

635
00:54:17,375 --> 00:54:18,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}or the baddies cheat,

636
00:54:19,500 --> 00:54:23,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}but because back up couldn't  get there fast enough.

637
00:54:23,292 --> 00:54:24,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Help me out, Superintendent Wong!

638
00:54:24,375 --> 00:54:25,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Please hurry!

639
00:55:45,042 --> 00:55:46,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Show me the stuff!

640
00:55:46,625 --> 00:55:47,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Luke,

641
00:55:48,417 --> 00:55:49,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}put it on the speakers.

642
00:56:22,167 --> 00:56:23,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Nice! Transfer the money.

643
01:00:18,542 --> 01:00:20,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You picked up!

644
01:00:20,833 --> 01:00:23,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Even the Brazilians can't kill you.

645
01:00:24,875 --> 01:00:26,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I really admire you.

646
01:00:27,417 --> 01:00:30,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Too bad your time is up.

647
01:00:37,875 --> 01:00:39,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Do you know your mistake?

648
01:00:40,417 --> 01:00:41,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You're too greedy.

649
01:00:42,792 --> 01:00:44,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Money is not an issue.

650
01:00:44,417 --> 01:00:47,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Take it. I can't spend it all.

651
01:00:48,167 --> 01:00:49,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}But you want power.

652
01:00:49,792 --> 01:00:51,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You want to replace me.

653
01:00:52,917 --> 01:00:54,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Don't be such a bitch!

654
01:00:55,042 --> 01:00:56,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Your plan really worked.

655
01:00:56,667 --> 01:00:58,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You get the money and the goods.

656
01:00:58,667 --> 01:01:00,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}That's so obvious!

657
01:01:00,417 --> 01:01:02,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}With you out of the way,

658
01:01:03,917 --> 01:01:06,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I can pin everything on you.

659
01:01:07,083 --> 01:01:08,958
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Luckily I didn't kill you last time,

660
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:11,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}or this won't work.

661
01:01:12,417 --> 01:01:15,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}In your next life, wise up.

662
01:01:15,542 --> 01:01:17,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}That's how you extend your shelf life.

663
01:01:17,917 --> 01:01:20,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}But this time, you're finished.

664
01:01:21,625 --> 01:01:24,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}No, you are, Mr. Chairman.

665
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:30,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}A narrow mind makes life  difficult for others.

666
01:01:31,167 --> 01:01:34,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}A narrow vision can get yourself killed.

667
01:01:37,125 --> 01:01:39,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Greed is normal,

668
01:01:39,917 --> 01:01:43,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}but overdoing it will piss people off,

669
01:01:43,792 --> 01:01:45,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}especially Mr. Tung.

670
01:01:47,125 --> 01:01:48,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}He arranged this

671
01:01:48,917 --> 01:01:50,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}just to see how big your appetite is,

672
01:01:50,667 --> 01:01:52,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}and how much you can swallow.

673
01:01:53,000 --> 01:01:53,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I'm sure

674
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:57,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}you took the goods last time.

675
01:02:04,042 --> 01:02:05,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Ming, so it was you.

676
01:02:10,417 --> 01:02:13,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Ming, I already told you

677
01:02:13,792 --> 01:02:17,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}to hire reputable hitmen.

678
01:02:17,625 --> 01:02:21,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Or at least don't be stingy.

679
01:02:28,292 --> 01:02:29,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Have fun.

680
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Enjoy the ride.

681
01:02:46,125 --> 01:02:47,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Lam!

682
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I have the goods.

683
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:50,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Wrap it up!

684
01:02:55,250 --> 01:02:56,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Right!

685
01:03:01,875 --> 01:03:05,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Forget the massage parlor, go get laid.

686
01:03:30,667 --> 01:03:31,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Get out!

687
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Who are you?

688
01:03:47,167 --> 01:03:50,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}That day with Lam Tung Yau  and the chick in Macau.

689
01:03:50,667 --> 01:03:52,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}It wasn't the first time  you called the cops.

690
01:03:59,042 --> 01:04:00,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Well?

691
01:04:00,542 --> 01:04:01,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You have nothing to say?

692
01:04:02,167 --> 01:04:04,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Yes, I'm a cop.

693
01:04:09,667 --> 01:04:11,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I can't choose who I am,

694
01:04:12,792 --> 01:04:14,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}but I can choose who I save.

695
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}We're brothers... right here!

696
01:04:21,667 --> 01:04:25,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}If you can't feel it,  anything I say is bullshit.

697
01:04:28,917 --> 01:04:30,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You want me dead?

698
01:04:30,750 --> 01:04:32,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}None of this is necessary.

699
01:04:32,417 --> 01:04:33,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Shoot me!

700
01:04:33,292 --> 01:04:35,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}If I hadn't taken you to Brazil,

701
01:04:35,167 --> 01:04:38,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Kwok Ming would have killed you.

702
01:04:53,292 --> 01:04:59,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You asked me if you caught  me betraying you,

703
01:04:59,417 --> 01:05:01,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}what I would want you to do.

704
01:05:02,417 --> 01:05:03,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}My answer is...

705
01:05:05,042 --> 01:05:06,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}it has never crossed my mind.

706
01:05:07,792 --> 01:05:09,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I never intend to betray you.

707
01:05:14,167 --> 01:05:17,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Now that Kwok Ming is dead,

708
01:05:18,167 --> 01:05:21,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I can spy on the cops for you.

709
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:24,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}We'll call the shots from now on.

710
01:05:27,667 --> 01:05:29,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}And be a double-crosser?

711
01:05:30,542 --> 01:05:33,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Using the cops and the triad to get ahead?

712
01:05:36,375 --> 01:05:37,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}That's so typical of you!

713
01:05:38,042 --> 01:05:39,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}So typical!

714
01:07:41,625 --> 01:07:45,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I am Blackjack.

715
01:08:23,542 --> 01:08:24,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Show me the stuff.

716
01:09:10,667 --> 01:09:12,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}OK, Cart noodles sold out.

717
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:15,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Copy! Closing time!

718
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:37,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Godfather!

719
01:09:37,667 --> 01:09:40,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Thanks for bringing him back to me.

720
01:09:40,167 --> 01:09:41,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I owe you a present.

721
01:09:41,875 --> 01:09:43,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I always deliver.

722
01:09:44,625 --> 01:09:46,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Don't be silly!

723
01:09:46,667 --> 01:09:49,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You should be happy. Don't cry.

724
01:09:50,125 --> 01:09:52,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Brother Foon Hei is my senior.

725
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:57,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I went undercover more than 10 years ago.

726
01:09:58,167 --> 01:09:59,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Then my handler was taken out.

727
01:10:00,542 --> 01:10:05,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}He told me before he died the dealers  had put up a reward to find the mole.

728
01:10:07,875 --> 01:10:09,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I had no choice

729
01:10:10,042 --> 01:10:12,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}but to delete my own file.

730
01:10:17,542 --> 01:10:21,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Nobody knows he's a cop.

731
01:10:21,292 --> 01:10:24,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}He begged me to take him back.

732
01:10:24,542 --> 01:10:25,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}No?

733
01:10:26,042 --> 01:10:27,458
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I saved your

734
01:10:27,500 --> 01:10:28,708
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}ass 3 years ago.

735
01:10:28,750 --> 01:10:32,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}He's bragging.  Playing dead is my strong suit.

736
01:10:32,125 --> 01:10:33,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What were you doing at the reservoir?

737
01:10:33,792 --> 01:10:36,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Q told me he had lost contact with you.

738
01:10:36,542 --> 01:10:38,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}We suspect Kwok Ming took you.

739
01:10:38,792 --> 01:10:39,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Long time no see!

740
01:10:39,917 --> 01:10:42,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}If it's true, he will kill you.

741
01:10:42,125 --> 01:10:44,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}So I must beat him to it.

742
01:10:45,917 --> 01:10:47,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What about Blackjack?

743
01:10:48,792 --> 01:10:49,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}That reminds me...

744
01:10:49,375 --> 01:10:50,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Blackjack doesn't know you're alive.

745
01:10:50,917 --> 01:10:52,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You must stay here.

746
01:10:52,625 --> 01:10:54,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Eat, sleep and recuperate.

747
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Stay put until the whole thing  blows over, OK?

748
01:10:56,667 --> 01:10:58,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}How nice of you!

749
01:10:58,625 --> 01:10:59,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}- I have something for you.  - What?

750
01:10:59,917 --> 01:11:02,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}This should do it for your mental  and physical needs.

751
01:11:02,542 --> 01:11:03,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What is it?

752
01:11:03,167 --> 01:11:05,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}No masking for breakfast,  masking for lunch.

753
01:11:05,417 --> 01:11:06,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What do you take me for?

754
01:11:06,917 --> 01:11:07,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Quit your act!

755
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}It's boring to be alone.

756
01:11:09,167 --> 01:11:10,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You're at that wolfish age...

757
01:11:10,167 --> 01:11:11,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Wolf your ass!

758
01:11:11,292 --> 01:11:12,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What are you laughing at?

759
01:11:12,667 --> 01:11:14,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}How sweet!

760
01:11:14,042 --> 01:11:15,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What about my needs?

761
01:11:15,917 --> 01:11:16,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You're on your own.

762
01:11:17,250 --> 01:11:18,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}That's no fun!

763
01:11:30,875 --> 01:11:34,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Shiu and Lam both claim to be Blackjack.

764
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:37,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Who's the real one?

765
01:11:46,542 --> 01:11:48,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Shiu's parents were doctors.

766
01:11:48,625 --> 01:11:50,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}While he was in Form 1,

767
01:11:50,542 --> 01:11:52,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}he studied Form 6 Maths.

768
01:11:52,792 --> 01:11:55,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}At 15, he went to Europe with his parents.

769
01:11:55,792 --> 01:11:56,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}They were killed in a car accident.

770
01:11:57,042 --> 01:11:59,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}There was nothing on him after that

771
01:11:59,792 --> 01:12:01,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}until Tak Mou.

772
01:12:01,875 --> 01:12:04,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Counting the years. He should have  started 3 years earlier than Lam

773
01:12:04,875 --> 01:12:06,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}but Lam surpassed him.

774
01:12:08,167 --> 01:12:11,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Shiu knows Hong's code and saved my life.

775
01:12:12,125 --> 01:12:15,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Lam knows about Blackjack.

776
01:12:16,167 --> 01:12:17,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Where is that?

777
01:12:17,167 --> 01:12:18,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Lam's flat.

778
01:12:28,750 --> 01:12:30,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I just thought of something.

779
01:12:30,750 --> 01:12:32,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Once I met with Hong...

780
01:12:33,667 --> 01:12:35,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Showing off?

781
01:12:35,667 --> 01:12:37,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}My son taught me.

782
01:12:37,250 --> 01:12:38,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}He's at the center

783
01:12:38,917 --> 01:12:40,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}and I can protect him.

784
01:12:52,042 --> 01:12:52,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I got something.

785
01:12:52,917 --> 01:12:54,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}4 months ago,

786
01:12:54,000 --> 01:12:57,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}someone hacked into  Hong's computer for 2 minutes.

787
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:00,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}He hacked into

788
01:13:00,708 --> 01:13:02,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}and corrupted the Blackjack file

789
01:13:02,333 --> 01:13:03,833
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}and the decoding table for Hong's code.

790
01:13:13,500 --> 01:13:14,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}We overlooked something.

791
01:13:14,875 --> 01:13:19,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Shiu runs the online casino at Tak Mou.

792
01:13:19,667 --> 01:13:21,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}He's an I.T. expert.

793
01:13:21,375 --> 01:13:24,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}He hacked into the Police server.

794
01:13:24,542 --> 01:13:26,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}He knew we lost contact with Blackjack

795
01:13:26,417 --> 01:13:28,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}and couldn't reinstate his identity.

796
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:30,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}So he posed as him.

797
01:13:30,167 --> 01:13:32,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Why did he take such risks?

798
01:13:32,417 --> 01:13:33,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What do you think?

799
01:13:35,792 --> 01:13:37,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You said Lam surpassed him.

800
01:13:41,208 --> 01:13:42,833
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}A gambler

801
01:13:42,875 --> 01:13:44,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}hates to lose.

802
01:13:49,042 --> 01:13:52,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}He wants to use our intel  on the drug dealers,

803
01:13:52,292 --> 01:13:53,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}so he can beat Lam.

804
01:13:54,792 --> 01:13:58,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}If he's after the biggest gain,

805
01:13:58,667 --> 01:14:00,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}robbing the dealers  would have been quicker.

806
01:14:04,875 --> 01:14:07,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Lam is our guy.

807
01:14:08,542 --> 01:14:10,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}The real undercover.

808
01:14:13,667 --> 01:14:15,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Shiu is only a hacker,

809
01:14:15,792 --> 01:14:18,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}an imposter out to rob the baddies.

810
01:14:33,750 --> 01:14:36,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Mr. Tung wants to meet me tomorrow night.

811
01:14:39,292 --> 01:14:41,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}He wants to discuss  the drug deal tomorrow night.

812
01:15:01,750 --> 01:15:02,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Allow me to introduce

813
01:15:02,500 --> 01:15:04,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}my new right-hand man and new partner.

814
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Cheers!

815
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:06,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Cheers!

816
01:15:11,958 --> 01:15:14,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Know why I only do drugs

817
01:15:16,542 --> 01:15:19,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}and not the other vices?

818
01:15:21,375 --> 01:15:23,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Because I like it.

819
01:15:24,417 --> 01:15:26,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You're not laughing.  You don't like my joke?

820
01:15:26,792 --> 01:15:29,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You're a college grad and you don't get it?

821
01:15:31,542 --> 01:15:37,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}A college grad should have a bright future.

822
01:15:37,542 --> 01:15:39,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Why didn't you become a cop?

823
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:41,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What for? Justice?

824
01:15:41,417 --> 01:15:43,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I need to make a living.

825
01:15:43,542 --> 01:15:47,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}They use posters of the God  of Wealth for Chinese New Year.

826
01:15:47,542 --> 01:15:50,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Not a cop.

827
01:15:52,167 --> 01:15:53,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Good point!

828
01:15:54,625 --> 01:15:55,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Eat, don't let the food get cold.

829
01:15:55,750 --> 01:15:56,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Come on!

830
01:15:59,542 --> 01:16:02,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Brother Foon Hei, except for your money,

831
01:16:02,750 --> 01:16:06,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I know nothing else about you.

832
01:16:11,250 --> 01:16:12,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Kwok Ming's thugs...

833
01:16:14,667 --> 01:16:16,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}NG Pak...

834
01:16:19,292 --> 01:16:20,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Wait...

835
01:16:22,167 --> 01:16:23,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}good... and action!

836
01:16:24,875 --> 01:16:26,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Closer!

837
01:16:27,042 --> 01:16:28,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Look into the camera!

838
01:16:28,167 --> 01:16:32,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Smile!

839
01:16:35,042 --> 01:16:35,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Fuck!

840
01:16:36,167 --> 01:16:38,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}We're eating. Get rid of the blood.

841
01:16:41,792 --> 01:16:45,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}If you want a piece of the action,

842
01:16:45,542 --> 01:16:48,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I like to have the goods on you.

843
01:16:48,625 --> 01:16:49,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What do you think?

844
01:16:52,417 --> 01:16:55,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You're too old to look cute.

845
01:17:03,167 --> 01:17:04,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Brother Foon Hei,

846
01:17:05,042 --> 01:17:06,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}honesfly,

847
01:17:08,292 --> 01:17:09,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I suspected you.

848
01:17:09,792 --> 01:17:10,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What?

849
01:17:12,875 --> 01:17:14,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You want to know why?

850
01:17:14,542 --> 01:17:15,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I'll tell you.

851
01:17:16,292 --> 01:17:19,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}It goes back to when I first started out.

852
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:23,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You see... someone had the goods on me,

853
01:17:24,042 --> 01:17:27,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}and ordered me to kill for them.

854
01:17:27,917 --> 01:17:30,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}A complete stranger.

855
01:17:30,042 --> 01:17:32,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Later on, I found out her name was...

856
01:17:33,042 --> 01:17:34,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}...Karina.

857
01:17:36,875 --> 01:17:38,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}How did I know?

858
01:17:38,792 --> 01:17:41,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}She was on the phone when she was dying.

859
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:42,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}The person on the other end  was calling her name.

860
01:17:42,667 --> 01:17:44,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Karina! Karina!

861
01:17:44,875 --> 01:17:46,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I knew then her name was Karina.

862
01:17:50,417 --> 01:17:52,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Karina!

863
01:17:54,417 --> 01:17:55,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Karina!

864
01:17:55,792 --> 01:17:59,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}It was my first hit and I was scared.

865
01:18:00,042 --> 01:18:02,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}When I stabbed her,

866
01:18:02,500 --> 01:18:04,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}her blood splashed all over me.

867
01:18:05,167 --> 01:18:07,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I stabbed her repeatedly  until she was dead.

868
01:18:11,250 --> 01:18:12,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Guess what

869
01:18:13,042 --> 01:18:16,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I was feeling when I saw  the blood on the floor?

870
01:18:19,500 --> 01:18:23,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}No different from killing a fish.

871
01:18:25,542 --> 01:18:26,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Except...

872
01:18:27,167 --> 01:18:30,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}she was staring at me

873
01:18:32,292 --> 01:18:34,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}and gave me the creeps.

874
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:36,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What did I do?

875
01:18:39,417 --> 01:18:41,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I gouged out her eyes.

876
01:19:04,417 --> 01:19:06,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Brother Foon Hei,

877
01:19:07,417 --> 01:19:09,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I checked up on you.

878
01:19:11,125 --> 01:19:13,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Your ex-wife's name was Karina.

879
01:19:23,167 --> 01:19:26,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I find that too coincidental.

880
01:19:26,792 --> 01:19:31,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}My wife's name was Katrina, not Karina.

881
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:35,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}If you killed my wife,

882
01:19:36,042 --> 01:19:38,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}you wouldn't be here snorting drugs.

883
01:19:44,500 --> 01:19:45,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I should be grateful

884
01:19:45,708 --> 01:19:47,333
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}your wife's name is Katrina, right?

885
01:19:48,167 --> 01:19:49,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Here's to us!

886
01:19:49,667 --> 01:19:51,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Cheers!

887
01:19:59,542 --> 01:20:01,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}How could you stand that?

888
01:20:02,500 --> 01:20:04,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I should thank you.

889
01:20:05,042 --> 01:20:08,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I glanced at you when  I was about to strike.

890
01:20:08,917 --> 01:20:11,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You reminded me of who I am.

891
01:20:29,417 --> 01:20:30,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Hello?

892
01:20:30,500 --> 01:20:31,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Q

893
01:20:32,792 --> 01:20:34,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I hit a dead end.

894
01:20:34,167 --> 01:20:37,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Lam doesn't trust me anymore.

895
01:20:38,667 --> 01:20:39,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I decided to have a showdown.

896
01:20:39,917 --> 01:20:41,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}No! Put that thought on hold.

897
01:20:42,500 --> 01:20:43,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}For two reasons...

898
01:20:43,250 --> 01:20:45,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}One, you're all we've got.  Nothing must happen to you.

899
01:20:45,667 --> 01:20:46,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Two,

900
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:49,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}we bugged Lam's flat.

901
01:20:50,167 --> 01:20:52,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}We'll soon get the scoop. You should wait.

902
01:20:52,750 --> 01:20:54,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}We'll contact you when we find out anything

903
01:20:54,875 --> 01:20:56,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}and plan our next move.

904
01:20:56,667 --> 01:20:57,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}OK?

905
01:20:58,292 --> 01:20:59,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Sure!

906
01:21:14,542 --> 01:21:16,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}This international drug cartel

907
01:21:16,292 --> 01:21:19,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}has a major deal in the works.

908
01:21:19,625 --> 01:21:21,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}According to the intel from CIB,

909
01:21:21,625 --> 01:21:24,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Shiu intends to intercept the deal.

910
01:21:24,792 --> 01:21:27,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}NB should stand by.

911
01:21:33,542 --> 01:21:37,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}(Shiu ready to move. Standby for the arrest.)

912
01:21:59,667 --> 01:22:00,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Looking for me?

913
01:22:05,792 --> 01:22:07,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Here's a plane ticket to Taiwan

914
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:10,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}and a house key.

915
01:22:10,917 --> 01:22:12,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Everything is all set up.

916
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:16,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Someone trustworthy will go with you.

917
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:18,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You can start over.

918
01:22:19,500 --> 01:22:21,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I bought you a ticket to Malaysia.

919
01:22:21,917 --> 01:22:23,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Everything is also set up.

920
01:22:32,292 --> 01:22:33,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Enough of this madness!

921
01:22:33,917 --> 01:22:35,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}No.

922
01:22:37,042 --> 01:22:40,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What's wrong with a life of  fast cars and women?

923
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:43,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Give it a rest.

924
01:22:49,417 --> 01:22:52,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I won't let anyone stop me.

925
01:23:00,625 --> 01:23:02,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Who's that behind the door?

926
01:23:03,792 --> 01:23:05,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}One of the 10 Outstanding Young Persons?

927
01:23:06,667 --> 01:23:08,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}So what if you could get in?

928
01:23:15,792 --> 01:23:17,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You want me to leave?

929
01:23:21,292 --> 01:23:22,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I see.

930
01:24:32,667 --> 01:24:35,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Cart Noodles, where is my visual?

931
01:24:35,292 --> 01:24:36,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Cart Noodles...

932
01:24:52,417 --> 01:24:53,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Get up!

933
01:26:03,042 --> 01:26:04,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Get in!

934
01:26:05,042 --> 01:26:06,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}- Get in!  - Go, Boss!

935
01:26:07,375 --> 01:26:09,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Let go!

936
01:26:09,917 --> 01:26:10,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Work with me!

937
01:26:10,667 --> 01:26:11,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Let go!

938
01:26:12,792 --> 01:26:13,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Let go!

939
01:26:43,375 --> 01:26:44,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Drive...

940
01:27:26,167 --> 01:27:27,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Ding, go!

941
01:28:44,792 --> 01:28:46,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I'm fine.

942
01:28:47,167 --> 01:28:48,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What the hell! Call it in!

943
01:28:53,375 --> 01:28:55,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}While his bullet is jammed,

944
01:28:55,417 --> 01:28:56,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}make a run for it.

945
01:28:56,917 --> 01:28:58,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Don't mind me.

946
01:28:58,042 --> 01:28:59,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}1... 2...

947
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:05,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Go! What are you waiting for?

948
01:29:17,542 --> 01:29:18,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Easy...

949
01:29:18,792 --> 01:29:20,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}No rush...

950
01:29:26,792 --> 01:29:27,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Chill!

951
01:29:34,417 --> 01:29:36,333
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Do you know why

952
01:29:36,542 --> 01:29:39,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}AV is free in Heaven?

953
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:41,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Because what we do...

954
01:29:46,417 --> 01:29:48,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Heaven is watching.

955
01:29:52,000 --> 01:29:53,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Hang in there! You'll be fine.

956
01:29:53,500 --> 01:29:54,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Hang in there!

957
01:29:56,042 --> 01:29:57,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Listen to me.

958
01:29:59,042 --> 01:30:00,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I don't think I'll make it home today.

959
01:30:02,542 --> 01:30:04,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Look after Cutie for me.

960
01:30:06,917 --> 01:30:09,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}There's dog food in the kitchen.

961
01:30:09,250 --> 01:30:13,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Walk her after you feed her.

962
01:30:14,042 --> 01:30:16,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}No more stupid gags from me again.

963
01:30:19,542 --> 01:30:21,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}This time, we're really splitting up.

964
01:30:21,625 --> 01:30:23,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}No!

965
01:30:24,667 --> 01:30:26,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Not if it kills me!

966
01:30:33,542 --> 01:30:37,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}No way...

967
01:31:04,000 --> 01:31:05,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Copy.

968
01:31:05,292 --> 01:31:06,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Word from NB:

969
01:31:06,250 --> 01:31:07,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}they made a bust.

970
01:31:07,542 --> 01:31:09,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}But Shiu didn't show up.

971
01:31:09,042 --> 01:31:10,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Tell OCTB to find him.

972
01:31:29,542 --> 01:31:31,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Siu Ying is dead.

973
01:31:32,625 --> 01:31:33,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}How could you do it?

974
01:31:54,917 --> 01:31:56,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}That's nice!

975
01:31:56,292 --> 01:31:57,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You want to bury your godchild too?

976
01:32:00,542 --> 01:32:01,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Go ahead!

977
01:32:02,917 --> 01:32:03,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}All these years,

978
01:32:03,917 --> 01:32:05,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}in order to keep Mandy out of harm's way,

979
01:32:06,000 --> 01:32:07,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}you asked Auntie Mui to look after her.

980
01:32:07,667 --> 01:32:10,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You're such a wonderful father.

981
01:32:23,917 --> 01:32:25,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You want her to live?

982
01:32:27,292 --> 01:32:28,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Kill yourself.

983
01:32:32,167 --> 01:32:34,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Have a heart. You're a cop.

984
01:32:36,667 --> 01:32:39,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You've always been careful.

985
01:32:39,042 --> 01:32:40,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}No other cops could put a tail on you.

986
01:32:40,917 --> 01:32:42,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}We bugged Lam's flat.

987
01:32:42,542 --> 01:32:43,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}We'll soon get the scoop.

988
01:32:43,792 --> 01:32:44,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You should wait.

989
01:32:44,792 --> 01:32:46,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}How did Q manage?

990
01:32:46,417 --> 01:32:47,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Unless you collaborated with him.

991
01:32:49,292 --> 01:32:50,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Keep talking.

992
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:55,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You asked me what  I want you to do if I'm the mole.

993
01:32:56,125 --> 01:32:57,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What if you're the mole?

994
01:33:02,042 --> 01:33:04,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}We're brothers... right here!

995
01:33:05,292 --> 01:33:08,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}If you can't feel it,  anything I say is bullshit.

996
01:33:09,417 --> 01:33:10,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You said that.

997
01:33:16,417 --> 01:33:17,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}10 seconds.

998
01:33:39,875 --> 01:33:41,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Keep your word.

999
01:34:39,292 --> 01:34:40,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}A blank.

1000
01:34:45,875 --> 01:34:50,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Back then when you secretly let Mandy go,

1001
01:34:50,417 --> 01:34:52,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I knew you're not a bad person.

1002
01:34:54,167 --> 01:34:56,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}What we do has nothing to do with her.

1003
01:34:57,667 --> 01:34:59,375
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I'd love to have her as a godchild.

1004
01:35:00,625 --> 01:35:03,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}But I don't want people to know

1005
01:35:04,042 --> 01:35:05,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}she has a godfather like me.

1006
01:35:09,625 --> 01:35:10,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}But you're different.

1007
01:35:12,417 --> 01:35:13,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You're a real cop.

1008
01:35:17,500 --> 01:35:20,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You never considered seizing the drugs?

1009
01:35:20,542 --> 01:35:21,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Yes.

1010
01:35:23,292 --> 01:35:25,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I hired someone.

1011
01:35:25,375 --> 01:35:27,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}But I find something fishy  between you and Q.

1012
01:35:27,625 --> 01:35:28,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}So I decided against it.

1013
01:35:30,042 --> 01:35:32,042
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I agree.

1014
01:35:37,917 --> 01:35:38,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}About Siu Ying...

1015
01:35:38,792 --> 01:35:40,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I trust you didn't do it.

1016
01:36:05,875 --> 01:36:08,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}The cops

1017
01:36:08,250 --> 01:36:10,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}busted my goods.

1018
01:36:13,250 --> 01:36:15,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I don't care who the mole is.

1019
01:36:17,292 --> 01:36:18,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I want him dead.

1020
01:36:23,042 --> 01:36:25,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}The Brazilian captain is cool.

1021
01:36:25,292 --> 01:36:26,750
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Who's afraid of who?

1022
01:36:29,042 --> 01:36:31,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}He's the back scrubber at the sauna.

1023
01:36:31,375 --> 01:36:33,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Claims to know qigong.

1024
01:36:35,042 --> 01:36:36,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Get rid of him and we'll go get a massage.

1025
01:36:36,917 --> 01:36:38,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Hurry up!

1026
01:37:31,792 --> 01:37:35,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Hang in there, buddy.

1027
01:37:35,292 --> 01:37:37,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}It won't be the first time.

1028
01:41:43,042 --> 01:41:44,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Lam told me

1029
01:41:44,917 --> 01:41:46,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}everyone has a choice.

1030
01:41:47,125 --> 01:41:49,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}CIB in the front,

1031
01:41:49,500 --> 01:41:51,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}NB in the back.

1032
01:41:52,792 --> 01:41:54,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Take your pick.

1033
01:41:57,000 --> 01:41:58,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Can't decide?

1034
01:41:58,542 --> 01:41:59,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I'll do it for you.

1035
01:42:05,167 --> 01:42:07,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Keep the eyes.

1036
01:42:13,167 --> 01:42:15,250
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}No, go to hell!

1037
01:42:26,292 --> 01:42:27,792
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Before I forget...

1038
01:42:27,792 --> 01:42:30,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}The CIB assault team is over there.

1039
01:42:41,917 --> 01:42:45,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}The NB made a move yesterday morning,

1040
01:42:45,250 --> 01:42:47,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}busted an international drug cartel

1041
01:42:47,792 --> 01:42:49,667
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}and arrested its mastermind Tung Pak Ho,

1042
01:42:50,250 --> 01:42:53,542
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}who was involved in money  laundering and hired hits.

1043
01:42:53,542 --> 01:42:54,625
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}The Police indicated the bust

1044
01:42:54,708 --> 01:42:56,500
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}was the result

1045
01:42:56,542 --> 01:42:59,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}of a deep undercover operation.

1046
01:43:17,042 --> 01:43:20,167
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I glanced at you when  I was about to strike.

1047
01:43:20,917 --> 01:43:23,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}You reminded me of who I was.

1048
01:43:26,042 --> 01:43:27,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I am a cop.

1049
01:44:02,292 --> 01:44:04,125
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}(Little Bok at 6 months)

1050
01:44:11,917 --> 01:44:13,875
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}(Little Bok, recital champ)

1051
01:44:18,167 --> 01:44:20,292
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}(Little Bok in Form 1)

1052
01:44:22,792 --> 01:44:24,417
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I don't get it.

1053
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:27,000
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}Who'd admit to being an undercover?

1054
01:44:30,042 --> 01:44:31,917
{\fnCalibri\fs14\1c&H40FF00&\b0}I'd love to be Little Bok again.
