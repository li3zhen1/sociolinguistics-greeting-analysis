1
00:01:58,174 --> 00:01:59,504
Let's go play.

2
00:02:02,012 --> 00:02:03,804
I'll look out for you.

3
00:02:09,643 --> 00:02:11,021
I can't swim.

4
00:02:11,438 --> 00:02:15,223
The water's not deep.
We'll stay near the bank and play in the mud.

5
00:02:15,608 --> 00:02:17,399
I'll protect you.

6
00:02:21,197 --> 00:02:22,988
Don't be scared, OK?

7
00:02:30,957 --> 00:02:32,368
I'm leaving you behind then.

8
00:02:33,584 --> 00:02:34,831
I'll go first.

9
00:02:58,692 --> 00:03:00,438
Here I come!

10
00:03:02,613 --> 00:03:04,191
Here I come!

11
00:03:36,064 --> 00:03:38,224
- I'm home.
- Xingxing's back.

12
00:03:39,817 --> 00:03:41,277
Wash up for dinner.

13
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:50,077
Use soap.

14
00:03:51,162 --> 00:03:52,538
Lots of it.

15
00:04:57,521 --> 00:04:58,718
Time to eat.

16
00:04:59,271 --> 00:05:01,848
Want some fried eggs?
I've made five.

17
00:05:09,158 --> 00:05:12,110
- You want some?
- No, I'll drink this first.

18
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:29,004
How was school today?

19
00:05:29,177 --> 00:05:30,175
Not bad.

20
00:05:33,223 --> 00:05:34,468
Here are some peanuts.

21
00:05:36,185 --> 00:05:37,466
You can have three.

22
00:06:04,545 --> 00:06:05,826
Xingxing.

23
00:06:06,007 --> 00:06:07,382
Xingxing!

24
00:06:18,394 --> 00:06:19,509
Xingxing!

25
00:06:20,478 --> 00:06:21,475
Xingxing!

26
00:06:25,108 --> 00:06:26,139
Xingxing!

27
00:06:28,612 --> 00:06:30,355
Take him to the hospital!

28
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:36,740
Careful!

29
00:06:48,298 --> 00:06:49,579
Haohao.

30
00:07:44,396 --> 00:07:45,937
Out of the way!

31
00:07:52,987 --> 00:07:54,235
SILENCE

32
00:07:54,406 --> 00:07:55,819
Out of the way!

33
00:07:58,117 --> 00:07:59,447
Watch out!

34
00:08:00,954 --> 00:08:02,235
Move aside!

35
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:20,631
Where's the kid?

36
00:10:22,847 --> 00:10:23,925
Upstairs.

37
00:10:24,265 --> 00:10:26,589
I've asked him to come but he won't.

38
00:10:27,185 --> 00:10:28,975
Playing that game again, huh?

39
00:10:32,190 --> 00:10:33,767
Why don't you go get him?

40
00:10:47,162 --> 00:10:48,278
Let's eat.

41
00:11:20,153 --> 00:11:21,435
Let's eat.

42
00:14:30,677 --> 00:14:33,002
Let's drop by the school tomorrow.

43
00:14:34,265 --> 00:14:36,222
If this goes on,

44
00:14:36,725 --> 00:14:38,387
we'll have to find him a new school.

45
00:14:39,311 --> 00:14:42,349
Your son is a little closed off.

46
00:14:42,772 --> 00:14:44,480
He keeps things to himself.

47
00:14:44,941 --> 00:14:46,650
We want the best for him, too.

48
00:14:46,819 --> 00:14:50,272
That's why we should discuss
how to handle it.

49
00:14:51,364 --> 00:14:53,276
I can't believe that.

50
00:14:56,078 --> 00:15:00,243
Can you look further into the case?

51
00:15:00,749 --> 00:15:02,126
As you wish.

52
00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:05,247
But it could escalate the problem

53
00:15:05,421 --> 00:15:07,746
and have an adverse effect on Liu Xing.

54
00:15:08,049 --> 00:15:09,460
Take my advice.

55
00:15:09,758 --> 00:15:13,210
Sit him down
and have a proper chat with him.

56
00:15:13,387 --> 00:15:16,507
Convince him to give it back.

57
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,140
There should be no hard feelings.

58
00:15:19,392 --> 00:15:21,883
Make him see the error of his ways.

59
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:26,685
It'll be fine
as long as he never does it again.

60
00:16:21,289 --> 00:16:22,320
Yaojun...

61
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:33,214
Explain this to me.

62
00:16:35,011 --> 00:16:37,550
I want to get back at them
for bullying me.

63
00:16:38,222 --> 00:16:39,599
Who bullied you?

64
00:16:40,056 --> 00:16:41,172
They did.

65
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:45,094
So you did steal it?

66
00:16:46,021 --> 00:16:47,479
What a good-for-nothing!

67
00:16:47,648 --> 00:16:49,143
I didn't steal it.

68
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:50,641
It wasn't me.

69
00:16:50,817 --> 00:16:53,107
Then what's it doing here?

70
00:16:55,323 --> 00:16:56,603
I hate this place.

71
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,158
I hate them.

72
00:16:58,325 --> 00:16:59,902
I hate you.

73
00:17:00,076 --> 00:17:01,074
Oh Xingxing!

74
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,366
- Xingxing!
- Stop!

75
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,497
Think you're a big boy now?

76
00:17:10,671 --> 00:17:13,590
Fine, we'll deal with this like adults.

77
00:17:14,173 --> 00:17:15,753
I won't hit you.

78
00:17:16,427 --> 00:17:18,005
You have two options.

79
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,507
Either...

80
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:24,432
give this back
and apologize to your classmate.

81
00:17:25,228 --> 00:17:26,390
Or...

82
00:17:26,978 --> 00:17:29,139
we hand you over to the police.

83
00:17:36,072 --> 00:17:38,362
Take me to the police station then.

84
00:17:40,575 --> 00:17:42,116
As you wish.

85
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,744
Now apologize to your mother.

86
00:17:46,707 --> 00:17:48,036
Let go of me.

87
00:17:51,420 --> 00:17:53,746
Yaojun, let go.

88
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,226
Xingxing.

89
00:18:10,314 --> 00:18:11,558
I'm sorry.

90
00:18:12,481 --> 00:18:14,190
I'm not good enough for you.

91
00:18:28,623 --> 00:18:30,535
Why are you doing this?

92
00:23:10,698 --> 00:23:12,525
Where in the world

93
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,111
could he be?

94
00:23:16,452 --> 00:23:18,114
Consider him dead.

95
00:23:36,722 --> 00:23:38,798
How could you say such a thing?

96
00:23:41,603 --> 00:23:43,929
We've raised him all these years.

97
00:23:46,441 --> 00:23:48,517
What do you want me to say?

98
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:52,519
You've fed and clothed him.

99
00:23:55,325 --> 00:23:56,951
You've spoiled him rotten.

100
00:23:57,245 --> 00:23:58,739
Don't tell me

101
00:23:59,247 --> 00:24:00,872
he'll care for you when you're old.

102
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:02,865
He's an ungrateful bastard!

103
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,206
He may look like Xingxing

104
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:08,086
but he's not our son.

105
00:24:08,506 --> 00:24:10,630
Our Xingxing is dead!

106
00:24:11,968 --> 00:24:13,296
Gone forever.

107
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,716
Today is Xing and Hao's birthday!

108
00:26:24,892 --> 00:26:27,893
You're making a celery dish, too?

109
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:31,144
It's Xing and Hao's birthday.

110
00:26:31,315 --> 00:26:32,643
What's for dinner?

111
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,769
It still isn't done cooking?

112
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:44,075
Here's your birthday present.
White Rabbit candy from Shanghai!

113
00:26:44,245 --> 00:26:45,621
All for you!

114
00:26:45,787 --> 00:26:48,410
Rock, paper, scissors!
The winner gets the jar.

115
00:26:49,709 --> 00:26:52,248
Rock, paper, scissors!

116
00:26:57,423 --> 00:26:59,715
Happy Birthday, boys!

117
00:27:06,307 --> 00:27:07,804
Cut the cake now.

118
00:27:09,894 --> 00:27:12,850
Weren't you dreaming of a birthday cake?

119
00:27:14,025 --> 00:27:16,065
Here it comes.

120
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:18,353
Decorated with flowers.

121
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:24,024
Where are the candles?

122
00:27:24,201 --> 00:27:26,277
Right here.

123
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:34,623
Hurry, blow them out.

124
00:27:40,383 --> 00:27:41,927
Together!

125
00:27:42,844 --> 00:27:44,506
Ready, set...

126
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:46,344
go!

127
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,307
Happy Birthday!

128
00:27:51,562 --> 00:27:55,430
These boys have the exact same birthday.

129
00:27:56,400 --> 00:28:00,018
If they were boy and girl
they'd make a nice couple.

130
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:01,821
Yes, that's a pity.

131
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:05,735
But this is great, too.
They're brothers now.

132
00:28:06,744 --> 00:28:07,740
Like us.

133
00:28:07,911 --> 00:28:10,366
Brothers now, brothers forever.

134
00:28:12,039 --> 00:28:13,998
What a heaven-sent blessing.

135
00:28:14,625 --> 00:28:18,044
I propose a toast to the little brothers!

136
00:28:21,258 --> 00:28:24,545
- Yaojun, I'll get going.
- OK, I have two more holes to drill.

137
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:22,604
Are you OK, Liyun?

138
00:29:22,818 --> 00:29:24,102
I'm fine.

139
00:29:24,822 --> 00:29:26,448
Can you take over for a minute?

140
00:29:41,671 --> 00:29:46,132
Come here. Turn around. Go to sleep.

141
00:29:54,643 --> 00:29:56,220
Stay out of Haiyan's sight.

142
00:29:58,523 --> 00:30:02,519
I can't hide this from her forever.

143
00:30:15,038 --> 00:30:17,199
We'll think of something.

144
00:30:18,209 --> 00:30:19,372
There must be a way.

145
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:25,382
What way?

146
00:30:26,007 --> 00:30:28,132
I'm about to show.

147
00:30:29,635 --> 00:30:32,176
I almost fainted in the factory today.

148
00:30:33,682 --> 00:30:35,259
Is it that bad already?

149
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:49,824
How about this?

150
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:52,865
Let's take a few days off

151
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:55,861
and stay with my aunt in the countryside.

152
00:30:56,581 --> 00:30:58,621
We'll pay the fine, no big deal.

153
00:30:59,709 --> 00:31:03,125
The baby's nickname can be "Penalty".

154
00:31:04,211 --> 00:31:06,420
That's not funny.

155
00:31:08,048 --> 00:31:09,593
It's not just the fine.

156
00:31:09,759 --> 00:31:12,216
We could both lose our jobs.

157
00:31:14,931 --> 00:31:16,307
Didn't you hear Haiyan?

158
00:31:17,683 --> 00:31:19,844
Things are even worse in the countryside.

159
00:31:26,526 --> 00:31:27,335
(Men speaking in Fujian Dialect)

160
00:31:27,361 --> 00:31:29,603
(Men speaking in Fujian Dialect)

161
00:31:44,629 --> 00:31:45,576
Mr Liu.

162
00:31:45,755 --> 00:31:48,128
Come have some tea with us.

163
00:31:50,008 --> 00:31:52,132
You've been working hard.

164
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,301
Come have a seat.

165
00:31:58,933 --> 00:32:01,176
Say, is your child back?

166
00:32:03,523 --> 00:32:04,899
What kind of tea is this?

167
00:32:07,235 --> 00:32:12,904
Why bring that up?
Kids his age are most difficult.

168
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,355
Particularly boys.

169
00:32:15,535 --> 00:32:17,160
Boys or girls.

170
00:32:17,326 --> 00:32:20,448
They're all only children
and hence a treasure.

171
00:32:21,413 --> 00:32:23,657
We shouldn't have brought that up.

172
00:32:23,834 --> 00:32:26,586
- Pour him some tea.
- Cut it out. Cut it out.

173
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:28,911
Oh, there's Liyun.

174
00:32:29,422 --> 00:32:31,796
- Liyun, come have some tea.
- I'm good, thanks.

175
00:32:32,008 --> 00:32:35,129
- Come have some tea.
- I'm good, thanks.

176
00:32:35,304 --> 00:32:37,260
Yaojun, it's time for lunch.

177
00:32:39,225 --> 00:32:40,221
Next time.

178
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:43,268
- Come back later.
- Sure.

179
00:32:44,313 --> 00:32:45,345
See you.

180
00:32:45,565 --> 00:32:49,728
You put your foot in your mouth just now.

181
00:32:51,112 --> 00:32:53,519
What a strange family.

182
00:32:54,907 --> 00:32:57,861
Everyone's flocking
to modern cities to get rich.

183
00:32:58,786 --> 00:33:01,952
But they came to this godforsaken place.

184
00:33:02,663 --> 00:33:05,667
I heard even the kid is not their own.

185
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,576
Seriously? No wonder.

186
00:33:10,172 --> 00:33:12,628
I'll go to the police station later today.

187
00:33:13,884 --> 00:33:18,215
There's no point in going there so often.
They'll call us if they hear something.

188
00:33:19,346 --> 00:33:21,721
We can't let them just sit on the case.

189
00:33:24,894 --> 00:33:26,769
The orphanage called me.

190
00:33:27,648 --> 00:33:31,182
He can only register his ID and permits

191
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,436
under our family's name.

192
00:33:34,113 --> 00:33:35,690
I've talked to my sister.

193
00:33:36,407 --> 00:33:38,033
She'll help out.

194
00:33:40,411 --> 00:33:42,238
As long as he comes back,

195
00:33:42,412 --> 00:33:44,653
I don't care where he's registered.

196
00:34:14,735 --> 00:34:16,195
Can you hear me?

197
00:34:19,782 --> 00:34:21,028
Who is it?

198
00:34:53,817 --> 00:34:56,059
I'm gonna stock up in town tomorrow.

199
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:59,778
And put up a search notice
in the newspaper.

200
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,402
Do you want anything from town?

201
00:35:06,288 --> 00:35:08,197
No, I'm good.

202
00:37:55,206 --> 00:37:56,831
You look like you've aged.

203
00:38:05,175 --> 00:38:06,836
Are you here on business?

204
00:38:08,427 --> 00:38:10,967
I didn't want to take this trip at first.

205
00:38:11,932 --> 00:38:15,634
But then I remembered
that you and Liyun live here.

206
00:38:15,811 --> 00:38:19,144
It might be a chance to see you before I
leave.

207
00:38:25,528 --> 00:38:28,102
How did you find out where we live?

208
00:38:29,115 --> 00:38:31,737
You think you could just vanish?

209
00:38:32,702 --> 00:38:34,826
Everyone knew what you were up to.

210
00:38:35,579 --> 00:38:37,572
First you went down to Hainan.

211
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,742
Soon afterwards you moved here.

212
00:38:40,543 --> 00:38:42,869
We all wondered where you'd go next.

213
00:38:44,005 --> 00:38:46,128
Unexpectedly you just stayed here.

214
00:38:50,512 --> 00:38:52,802
There's nowhere else for us to go.

215
00:38:54,349 --> 00:38:56,010
We like it here.

216
00:38:56,184 --> 00:38:58,141
We don't know anyone.

217
00:38:58,686 --> 00:39:01,605
In fact, we know nothing here.

218
00:39:01,773 --> 00:39:03,766
Not even their dialect.

219
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:06,143
Like living in a foreign country.

220
00:39:07,195 --> 00:39:08,820
I suppose so.

221
00:39:23,670 --> 00:39:25,414
How is Liyun?

222
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:28,543
She's OK.

223
00:39:32,221 --> 00:39:34,675
Just like she once said:

224
00:39:35,307 --> 00:39:37,347
"Time stopped for us long ago.

225
00:39:37,518 --> 00:39:41,597
"Now we're just waiting to grow old."

226
00:39:49,778 --> 00:39:51,606
How's your brother's family?

227
00:39:54,159 --> 00:39:55,570
Well...

228
00:39:56,202 --> 00:39:59,405
Haohao is a sophomore at university.

229
00:40:00,539 --> 00:40:02,000
Yingming is

230
00:40:02,793 --> 00:40:05,201
always busy with his business.

231
00:40:06,838 --> 00:40:08,664
Haiyan took early retirement

232
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,501
and just passes her time.

233
00:40:11,092 --> 00:40:12,884
When they heard I might see you,

234
00:40:13,052 --> 00:40:16,672
they told me to send you their regards.

235
00:40:26,023 --> 00:40:28,480
Did you say you're going abroad?

236
00:40:29,735 --> 00:40:30,851
Yes.

237
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:36,076
What I learned at university is getting
outdated.

238
00:40:36,701 --> 00:40:39,869
So I decided to take the TOEFL.
Somehow, I passed.

239
00:40:40,038 --> 00:40:42,872
As soon as I get back, I'll resign.

240
00:40:45,168 --> 00:40:47,210
- And your...
- We divorced.

241
00:40:49,505 --> 00:40:52,045
You read my mind.

242
00:40:53,135 --> 00:40:55,423
You were always such a smart kid.

243
00:40:55,596 --> 00:40:57,422
Well, you were my teacher.

244
00:40:57,556 --> 00:41:00,343
A few days' training in the factory don't count.

245
00:41:00,684 --> 00:41:03,851
Anyway,
I owe it to you that I got into university.

246
00:41:05,146 --> 00:41:07,556
You didn't even take my training seriously.

247
00:41:09,483 --> 00:41:10,813
Correct.

248
00:41:14,155 --> 00:41:15,483
Don't worry.

249
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:19,273
Hold still.

250
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,240
Stay calm.

251
00:41:22,414 --> 00:41:23,789
It won't bite.

252
00:41:27,210 --> 00:41:29,121
Your other hand.

253
00:41:39,139 --> 00:41:40,255
Hold that pose!

254
00:41:40,432 --> 00:41:41,630
Both of you.

255
00:41:41,807 --> 00:41:44,298
You know that pose right there?

256
00:41:45,144 --> 00:41:47,221
It's like the rumba dancers

257
00:41:47,396 --> 00:41:50,317
pressed this tight against each other.

258
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:58,112
How's that?

259
00:41:58,909 --> 00:42:00,735
Yaojun, now you've got yourself
an apprentice.

260
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:03,402
Moli, I'm telling you:
He knows all about machines.

261
00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:06,414
But about fashion, you have to ask me.

262
00:42:06,583 --> 00:42:09,074
What do you think of my outfit?

263
00:42:09,251 --> 00:42:12,788
Don't I look like a Hong Kong movie star?

264
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,880
Sure.
Your pants are sweeping the floor for us.

265
00:42:17,218 --> 00:42:18,215
Sweeping?

266
00:42:18,385 --> 00:42:19,384
I don't mind.

267
00:42:19,554 --> 00:42:20,670
It's fashion!

268
00:42:20,847 --> 00:42:22,756
Strange romance!

269
00:42:23,307 --> 00:42:24,306
On a bus!

270
00:42:25,684 --> 00:42:26,847
Looks nice!

271
00:42:27,394 --> 00:42:28,807
Yaojun, come here.

272
00:42:30,817 --> 00:42:33,307
There's a fabulous dance party tonight.

273
00:42:33,485 --> 00:42:35,110
A lights-out party!

274
00:42:36,195 --> 00:42:38,521
Lights-out, my ass! Get lost!

275
00:42:38,697 --> 00:42:40,110
You're so out.

276
00:42:40,282 --> 00:42:42,989
So come with me, Moli!

277
00:42:43,619 --> 00:42:45,163
How dare you!

278
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,291
You're really hitting me!

279
00:42:55,298 --> 00:42:56,840
It's the new dance moves.

280
00:42:57,009 --> 00:42:59,416
Jitterbug.

281
00:43:07,977 --> 00:43:09,224
Who is it?

282
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:10,976
It's me.

283
00:43:11,148 --> 00:43:12,476
Haiyan?

284
00:43:13,023 --> 00:43:14,222
Open the door.

285
00:43:15,902 --> 00:43:17,064
Sister-in-law.

286
00:43:17,237 --> 00:43:18,400
Hurry in.

287
00:43:19,030 --> 00:43:20,442
Come in, brother.

288
00:43:21,451 --> 00:43:22,731
Shut the door!

289
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:32,202
It's the new dance, named Jitterbug.

290
00:43:32,376 --> 00:43:33,326
Stop that.

291
00:43:33,795 --> 00:43:34,744
Why?

292
00:43:34,922 --> 00:43:36,831
Turn off this trashy music.

293
00:43:37,006 --> 00:43:40,625
Now you're a leader
and you want to meddle with everything.

294
00:43:40,802 --> 00:43:42,260
- Stop it.
- Don't pretend!

295
00:43:42,471 --> 00:43:43,847
- Stop it, stop it...
- No!

296
00:43:45,347 --> 00:43:47,009
Don't wreck the tape!

297
00:43:47,184 --> 00:43:49,425
I brought it all the way from Guangzhou!

298
00:43:51,980 --> 00:43:53,356
Well, Meiyu.

299
00:43:53,523 --> 00:43:55,813
How about we play something quiet?

300
00:44:00,530 --> 00:44:01,989
Don't be so serious.

301
00:44:13,293 --> 00:44:17,505
How could old friends forget

302
00:44:19,215 --> 00:44:23,297
the good times of the past.

303
00:44:24,806 --> 00:44:30,226
How could old friends forget

304
00:44:30,393 --> 00:44:34,557
the good times of the past.

305
00:44:36,900 --> 00:44:38,644
What song is this?

306
00:44:38,818 --> 00:44:39,898
It's beautiful.

307
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:42,523
"Everlasting Friendship."

308
00:44:43,365 --> 00:44:45,489
Liyun, have you heard it before?

309
00:44:47,994 --> 00:44:50,403
When we were sent to the countryside.

310
00:44:52,081 --> 00:44:54,371
No way you could hear such songs
during the cultural revolution.

311
00:44:55,001 --> 00:44:56,378
You just don't know.

312
00:44:57,086 --> 00:44:59,211
Meiyu, you've picked a great song.

313
00:44:59,380 --> 00:45:01,255
Perfect for the occasion.

314
00:45:03,968 --> 00:45:06,423
Was it '77 or 78?

315
00:45:07,097 --> 00:45:08,722
The end of 78.

316
00:45:10,432 --> 00:45:13,056
All the students were trying
to go back to the cities.

317
00:45:13,894 --> 00:45:19,105
Some got to leave, others didn't.
Every time it was a farewell for life.

318
00:45:21,235 --> 00:45:23,063
When it was our turn to leave,

319
00:45:23,572 --> 00:45:26,063
someone started to sing this song.

320
00:45:27,534 --> 00:45:29,989
We all burst into tears.

321
00:45:31,413 --> 00:45:33,489
Nobody had ever heard such a moving song.

322
00:45:34,125 --> 00:45:35,405
Right, Yingming?

323
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:37,038
Yes.

324
00:45:37,586 --> 00:45:39,043
Unforgettable.

325
00:45:42,548 --> 00:45:45,005
Comrade Deng clearly asserted at Beidaihe

326
00:45:45,177 --> 00:45:49,387
in a discussion with Police Chief Liu,
"The steep rise in serious crime

327
00:45:49,514 --> 00:45:52,349
"is highly detrimental to society.

328
00:45:52,518 --> 00:45:54,889
"The people are very dissatisfied.

329
00:45:55,061 --> 00:45:57,137
"Why not wage a war
against criminal activities,

330
00:45:57,313 --> 00:45:58,559
"once, twice, even three times?"

331
00:45:58,731 --> 00:46:00,059
Yaojun?

332
00:46:00,858 --> 00:46:02,105
Brother?

333
00:46:03,195 --> 00:46:06,231
- Yaojun!
- Yaojun. My brother is calling you.

334
00:46:06,405 --> 00:46:08,114
On 25th August, the patty central
government announced

335
00:46:08,282 --> 00:46:10,193
they will heavily crack down on crime.

336
00:46:29,137 --> 00:46:32,175
You'd better pick up your son
from his grandparents.

337
00:46:34,268 --> 00:46:35,596
He's fine.

338
00:46:36,144 --> 00:46:37,556
I'll stay here.

339
00:46:43,193 --> 00:46:44,652
You're back.

340
00:46:45,153 --> 00:46:47,146
- He's sleeping.
- He just fell asleep.

341
00:46:48,572 --> 00:46:50,233
There's a rum our in the factory.

342
00:46:50,407 --> 00:46:52,115
What happened?

343
00:46:52,284 --> 00:46:55,452
Xinjian got himself arrested
at a lights-out party.

344
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:01,416
For dancing?

345
00:47:01,586 --> 00:47:05,916
They're cracking down
and branding it "debauchery."

346
00:47:06,090 --> 00:47:08,166
Some have been executed for it.

347
00:47:24,233 --> 00:47:25,561
How about Meiyu?

348
00:47:25,735 --> 00:47:27,063
We don't know.

349
00:47:27,237 --> 00:47:28,731
We can't find her.

350
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:31,532
Have you seen her?

351
00:47:31,701 --> 00:47:33,277
No, we haven't.

352
00:47:39,458 --> 00:47:41,497
She didn't go to work today?

353
00:47:41,668 --> 00:47:42,996
No.

354
00:47:43,878 --> 00:47:45,539
Where could she be?

355
00:47:45,713 --> 00:47:47,210
What a mess.

356
00:47:56,432 --> 00:47:57,512
Meiyu just came back.

357
00:47:57,684 --> 00:48:00,092
- She's back?
- I saw her walk in.

358
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:02,355
We should check on her.

359
00:48:04,356 --> 00:48:06,148
Let's go and see.

360
00:48:36,264 --> 00:48:37,343
Stop it.

361
00:49:41,538 --> 00:49:42,735
Hello?

362
00:49:46,835 --> 00:49:48,032
Yes.

363
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:53,706
The truck broke down
in the middle of the road.

364
00:49:56,260 --> 00:49:57,887
I got someone to fix it.

365
00:50:00,307 --> 00:50:02,548
I'll pick up the stuff and then drive back.

366
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:07,018
Don't wait for me.

367
00:50:08,648 --> 00:50:09,976
Bye.

368
00:50:17,199 --> 00:50:19,239
You didn't tell her I'm in town?

369
00:50:36,384 --> 00:50:37,500
There you are.

370
00:50:38,804 --> 00:50:40,181
Have you eaten?

371
00:50:41,431 --> 00:50:42,463
Yeah.

372
00:50:46,686 --> 00:50:49,260
Go to bed.
I have to unload the truck first.

373
00:50:58,532 --> 00:51:01,652
Dear comrades of the communist petty
and youth league,

374
00:51:01,827 --> 00:51:07,365
to meet our goal by the end of this century
of limiting the population to 1.2 billion,

375
00:51:07,541 --> 00:51:12,335
the State Council has called upon couples
to have only one child.

376
00:51:12,503 --> 00:51:15,256
ONE COUPLE, ONE CHILD
ACHIEVING ECONOMIC REFORM

377
00:51:15,423 --> 00:51:19,422
This is a major measure that concerns the
speed and future of the Four Modernizations

378
00:51:19,593 --> 00:51:22,846
as well as the health and well-being
of future generations.

379
00:51:23,014 --> 00:51:26,266
This policy impacts national interests
in the long and shalt term.

380
00:51:26,476 --> 00:51:28,137
The central government
requires party members,

381
00:51:28,311 --> 00:51:30,981
especially cadres of various ranks,

382
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:33,396
to actively can)! this policy out,
to set an example,

383
00:51:33,567 --> 00:51:37,184
and to responsibly take on the duty

384
00:51:37,362 --> 00:51:40,317
of propaganda and education of the masses.

385
00:52:46,556 --> 00:52:47,588
What's wrong?

386
00:52:50,851 --> 00:52:52,512
Look what you've done!

387
00:52:54,939 --> 00:52:56,731
Stop playing dumb.

388
00:52:57,818 --> 00:52:59,608
Liyun's told me everything.

389
00:52:59,778 --> 00:53:01,735
She's several months along.

390
00:53:04,032 --> 00:53:08,362
How dare you hide this from me for so long!

391
00:53:13,125 --> 00:53:14,240
Well.

392
00:53:14,960 --> 00:53:17,250
You know the rules.

393
00:53:17,420 --> 00:53:21,835
I've called the hospital already.
A car is coming to pick us up.

394
00:53:28,014 --> 00:53:29,557
What the hell are you doing?

395
00:53:30,809 --> 00:53:32,434
We're going home.

396
00:53:35,688 --> 00:53:36,934
Yaojun!

397
00:53:37,648 --> 00:53:42,809
Do you really think you can run forever?

398
00:53:44,655 --> 00:53:46,068
Liyun,

399
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:48,068
don't be a fool.

400
00:53:48,284 --> 00:53:52,235
You've been foolish enough to let this happen.

401
00:53:53,456 --> 00:53:55,201
What if word gets out in the factory?

402
00:53:55,916 --> 00:53:58,206
Consider the consequences for me.

403
00:53:58,378 --> 00:54:00,253
Can't you see my point?

404
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:02,128
Director.

405
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,422
Come in.

406
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:06,048
Director.

407
00:54:06,218 --> 00:54:07,416
Let's go.

408
00:54:07,929 --> 00:54:09,045
Let's go.

409
00:54:09,806 --> 00:54:10,838
Let's go.

410
00:54:12,518 --> 00:54:13,550
Yaojun!

411
00:54:14,059 --> 00:54:15,092
Yaojun!

412
00:54:15,936 --> 00:54:17,597
Calm down! Restrain him!

413
00:54:18,273 --> 00:54:19,601
Stop it!

414
00:54:20,525 --> 00:54:21,936
You're out of your mind.

415
00:54:25,655 --> 00:54:26,771
Yaojun, how could you?

416
00:54:26,947 --> 00:54:29,403
Quickly, get in the car.

417
00:54:30,952 --> 00:54:32,280
Get in.

418
00:54:41,128 --> 00:54:42,672
- Liu Yaojun!
- It's OK!

419
00:54:44,965 --> 00:54:46,461
I'll come with you.

420
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:02,858
OK, let's go.

421
00:55:38,102 --> 00:55:39,182
Director Li.

422
00:55:39,355 --> 00:55:40,849
Dr Yang.

423
00:55:44,608 --> 00:55:46,934
This is Wang Liyun
from the Sorting Department.

424
00:55:47,820 --> 00:55:49,317
She has agreed.

425
00:55:49,489 --> 00:55:52,490
I see. Let's start with a blood test.

426
00:55:57,539 --> 00:55:58,702
Liyun,

427
00:55:58,875 --> 00:56:00,581
don't worry.

428
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:02,494
It'll be over in no time.

429
00:56:04,378 --> 00:56:06,621
I've taken care of everything.
You'll be fine.

430
00:56:06,798 --> 00:56:08,043
I'm here for you.

431
00:56:08,215 --> 00:56:09,164
Go on.

432
00:56:10,593 --> 00:56:12,135
Follow us.

433
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:08,432
Doctor Yang?

434
00:57:09,485 --> 00:57:10,684
Doctor Yang?

435
00:57:10,862 --> 00:57:12,653
- Doctor Yang?
- Here.

436
00:57:12,822 --> 00:57:14,947
Something's wrong. She's haemorrhaging.

437
00:57:15,117 --> 00:57:16,148
What's going on?

438
00:57:16,326 --> 00:57:17,784
Please take a look.

439
00:57:20,288 --> 00:57:21,664
- Who are you?
- I'm family.

440
00:57:21,831 --> 00:57:23,789
Please wait outside.
You can't be in here.

441
00:57:25,210 --> 00:57:26,668
What's happening to her?

442
00:57:29,630 --> 00:57:35,800
We are the future of communism.

443
00:57:36,681 --> 00:57:41,342
Following the path of revolutionary forebears.

444
00:57:42,226 --> 00:57:45,762
We love the motherland,
we love the people.

445
00:57:45,938 --> 00:57:50,814
We proudly call ourselves
the young pioneers.

446
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:16,213
Salute!

447
00:58:16,385 --> 00:58:17,668
At ease!

448
00:58:17,846 --> 00:58:19,306
Dismissed!

449
00:58:27,230 --> 00:58:31,358
It's time to present the final award of the day.

450
00:58:31,735 --> 00:58:35,186
The Annual Award for Family Planning
by Outstanding Individuals.

451
00:58:35,905 --> 00:58:39,606
Let's welcome Director Li
from the Family Planning Office

452
00:58:39,784 --> 00:58:42,869
on stage to present the award.

453
00:59:02,182 --> 00:59:06,596
This year,
our factory did well in family planning.

454
00:59:07,186 --> 00:59:10,852
Among couples of child-bearing age,
we achieved zero unplanned births.

455
00:59:11,023 --> 00:59:13,693
We're setting a positive example
for the locals.

456
00:59:14,443 --> 00:59:17,314
Besides that,
the party members are excellent,

457
00:59:17,489 --> 00:59:20,692
and the workers have shown
higher ideological awareness.

458
00:59:20,867 --> 00:59:26,110
Some comrades had to face personal hurdles.

459
00:59:27,164 --> 00:59:30,452
However, with our counseling,

460
00:59:30,626 --> 00:59:32,869
they've overcome them.

461
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:35,788
I hereby announce

462
00:59:36,925 --> 00:59:43,213
the 1986 Award for Family Planning:

463
00:59:43,389 --> 00:59:45,217
The honored couple is...

464
00:59:45,393 --> 00:59:48,061
Wang Liyun of the Sorting Department

465
00:59:48,602 --> 00:59:52,186
and Liu Yaojun of the Assembling Workshop!

466
01:00:01,115 --> 01:00:02,313
Congratulations.

467
01:00:30,769 --> 01:00:33,688
There's money in it. Why the frown?

468
01:00:35,650 --> 01:00:37,358
Give us a smile.

469
01:01:23,322 --> 01:01:26,028
Has Meiyu made up her mind
to go to Guangzhou?

470
01:01:27,785 --> 01:01:29,945
What's so unusual about that?

471
01:01:30,621 --> 01:01:34,788
Nowadays everyone with ambition
is going south.

472
01:01:37,253 --> 01:01:39,494
I admire her gumption.

473
01:01:47,139 --> 01:01:48,385
What about you?

474
01:01:50,182 --> 01:01:52,010
Want to get an IUD?

475
01:01:53,894 --> 01:01:55,271
I don't think I need one.

476
01:01:55,896 --> 01:01:58,222
The doctor said my uterus wall is too thin.

477
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,807
And then the surgery went wrong.

478
01:02:03,530 --> 01:02:05,820
I'm unlikely to get pregnant again.

479
01:02:07,784 --> 01:02:10,739
Yaojun should take the blame.

480
01:02:12,789 --> 01:02:18,079
He agreed to get a vasectomy,
but then sent someone in his stead to fool me.

481
01:02:20,255 --> 01:02:23,588
He looks like such an honest guy.

482
01:02:26,093 --> 01:02:27,423
Seriously?

483
01:02:29,472 --> 01:02:30,635
He's an idiot.

484
01:02:47,365 --> 01:02:49,072
There you are, Yaojun.

485
01:02:50,034 --> 01:02:52,608
- What brought you back?
- I was sent home for field practice.

486
01:02:53,621 --> 01:02:54,737
You're here, too?

487
01:02:58,293 --> 01:02:59,242
Where's Mama?

488
01:02:59,418 --> 01:03:00,664
Over there.

489
01:03:01,338 --> 01:03:03,829
Teach me how to waltz, would you?

490
01:03:04,340 --> 01:03:06,001
Your brother is a better dancer.

491
01:03:06,175 --> 01:03:08,003
Look, he's dancing with Meiyu.

492
01:03:10,137 --> 01:03:12,262
Kiddo? Here.

493
01:03:13,934 --> 01:03:15,215
Go have fun.

494
01:03:29,074 --> 01:03:30,699
You're about to graduate, right?

495
01:03:30,867 --> 01:03:32,860
Times flies, doesn't it?

496
01:03:33,035 --> 01:03:34,152
Yes.

497
01:03:34,329 --> 01:03:36,951
You're so tall,
I didn't recognize you anymore.

498
01:03:41,418 --> 01:03:43,045
You got a boyfriend?

499
01:03:43,963 --> 01:03:45,210
Do you want me to?

500
01:03:45,381 --> 01:03:46,876
Do I want you to?

501
01:03:47,050 --> 01:03:49,255
Just catching up with my apprentice.

502
01:03:51,556 --> 01:03:53,797
None of my classmates are my cup of tea.

503
01:03:55,143 --> 01:03:57,384
You don't want to end up like Meiyu, though.

504
01:03:57,852 --> 01:03:59,893
She's different, she's waiting for someone.

505
01:04:00,271 --> 01:04:01,896
For who? Xinjian?

506
01:04:02,064 --> 01:04:03,227
Of course.

507
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:05,108
That makes her a fool.

508
01:04:06,695 --> 01:04:09,186
All women are fools in love.

509
01:04:09,905 --> 01:04:12,445
You're right. Look at her:

510
01:04:13,492 --> 01:04:15,284
all meat and no brains.

511
01:04:22,085 --> 01:04:23,913
Is he still mad at me?

512
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:27,673
No, he isn't.

513
01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:30,961
He's just mad at himself.

514
01:04:31,596 --> 01:04:34,927
He's frustrated he could do nothing.

515
01:05:12,802 --> 01:05:15,211
How I wish you wouldn't go.

516
01:05:16,181 --> 01:05:18,423
So you could stay with me.

517
01:05:19,393 --> 01:05:24,731
Why won't you stay
Leave me here alone.

518
01:05:25,856 --> 01:05:28,561
Every meeting is too short.

519
01:05:29,360 --> 01:05:31,318
You always keep silent.

520
01:05:32,447 --> 01:05:35,282
Every time wave farewell.

521
01:05:36,034 --> 01:05:39,485
I'm always extremely sorrowful.

522
01:05:42,331 --> 01:05:45,166
How should I spend the long night alone.

523
01:05:45,335 --> 01:05:48,122
Please don't confuse me anymore.

524
01:05:53,843 --> 01:05:55,800
We are young now.

525
01:05:56,681 --> 01:05:58,672
We are full of energy.

526
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:03,135
Even if there are ups and downs in life,
never mind.

527
01:06:05,396 --> 01:06:07,307
Do not sigh.

528
01:06:08,192 --> 01:06:10,351
Do not abandon yourself.

529
01:06:11,027 --> 01:06:15,072
Only you can decide your success or failure.

530
01:06:16,615 --> 01:06:18,572
Time flies.

531
01:06:19,619 --> 01:06:21,742
It'll be too late

532
01:06:22,371 --> 01:06:25,326
if you don't cherish it.

533
01:06:46,105 --> 01:06:47,682
You're all here.

534
01:06:48,773 --> 01:06:50,231
I'm fine.

535
01:06:51,108 --> 01:06:53,980
The government has been easy on me.

536
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,735
It's not so bad in here.

537
01:06:59,909 --> 01:07:01,985
How is everyone?

538
01:07:04,414 --> 01:07:06,076
We're fine.

539
01:07:07,083 --> 01:07:08,710
Yingming joined the party.

540
01:07:08,876 --> 01:07:11,035
Haiyan got promoted to Director.

541
01:07:11,213 --> 01:07:12,460
Deputy Director only.

542
01:07:14,048 --> 01:07:16,422
Liyun and Yaojun
were named Outstanding Individuals.

543
01:07:16,592 --> 01:07:17,922
Not by choice.

544
01:07:21,139 --> 01:07:24,141
I'm going down south to try my luck.

545
01:07:30,064 --> 01:07:31,311
That's good to hear.

546
01:07:32,442 --> 01:07:35,018
Go out and see the world.

547
01:07:36,112 --> 01:07:39,731
Make the most of it once you get there.

548
01:07:40,909 --> 01:07:43,945
Don't let me hold you back.

549
01:07:46,789 --> 01:07:48,865
Xinjian, stop talking nonsense.

550
01:07:49,041 --> 01:07:51,617
Why does a grown man like you

551
01:07:53,338 --> 01:07:55,165
have such a long face?

552
01:07:56,299 --> 01:07:57,876
They've fattened you up.

553
01:08:01,346 --> 01:08:04,134
This new haircut suits you.
Makes you look decent.

554
01:08:07,309 --> 01:08:08,638
Alright, alright.

555
01:08:08,812 --> 01:08:13,937
We wanted to see if you are doing alright.

556
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:16,568
We'll get going now.

557
01:08:17,237 --> 01:08:18,814
See you next time.

558
01:08:21,407 --> 01:08:23,282
Take care, OK?

559
01:08:32,420 --> 01:08:33,795
Say something.

560
01:08:35,671 --> 01:08:37,215
Don't worry.

561
01:08:38,340 --> 01:08:42,554
I shall obey the government
and reform myself.

562
01:08:46,057 --> 01:08:47,554
Cut it out.

563
01:08:47,726 --> 01:08:49,387
Be serious.

564
01:08:50,188 --> 01:08:52,311
Can you give me your word?

565
01:09:05,661 --> 01:09:07,487
Go get them!

566
01:09:11,916 --> 01:09:13,742
Run! Run!

567
01:09:20,967 --> 01:09:22,711
Do you surrender?

568
01:09:22,885 --> 01:09:25,128
- Surrender or we'll keep shooting!
- No, we won't!

569
01:09:27,766 --> 01:09:29,309
Shoot! Shoot!

570
01:09:30,519 --> 01:09:32,228
Stop, we surrender!

571
01:09:32,896 --> 01:09:34,273
We Win!

572
01:09:36,108 --> 01:09:37,436
Let's go!

573
01:09:44,826 --> 01:09:46,202
Let's go home.

574
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:47,697
Let's play more.

575
01:09:47,869 --> 01:09:49,363
Let's go.

576
01:09:50,706 --> 01:09:52,865
Let's go somewhere else.

577
01:10:00,590 --> 01:10:01,622
Shall we go in?

578
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:03,081
No way.

579
01:10:12,059 --> 01:10:13,603
I'll go and see.

580
01:10:22,778 --> 01:10:24,572
Xingxing, come in.

581
01:10:24,738 --> 01:10:26,898
It's too dark. I don't want to.

582
01:10:27,032 --> 01:10:29,572
It's fun inside. Come on in.

583
01:10:29,744 --> 01:10:31,157
No.

584
01:10:54,353 --> 01:10:55,635
Haohao.

585
01:11:03,278 --> 01:11:04,653
Haohao?

586
01:11:08,282 --> 01:11:09,742
I'm coming in.

587
01:11:14,081 --> 01:11:17,034
- You scared me!
- What a pussy-cat!

588
01:11:18,961 --> 01:11:20,836
It's too dark in here.

589
01:11:22,046 --> 01:11:23,541
Come on, this way!

590
01:11:52,744 --> 01:11:55,412
So what's the latest news about the lay-offs?

591
01:11:56,414 --> 01:11:58,490
Everyone is worried.

592
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:14,344
Nobody knows who's really in charge.

593
01:12:16,684 --> 01:12:18,891
I've asked the manager several times.

594
01:12:19,063 --> 01:12:21,019
All he did was give me attitude.

595
01:12:21,188 --> 01:12:24,606
Said I should set an example
as an outstanding individual.

596
01:12:25,485 --> 01:12:28,688
As though that was my idea.

597
01:12:29,282 --> 01:12:32,898
And that was years ago already.

598
01:12:34,119 --> 01:12:35,613
It's so upsetting.

599
01:12:36,996 --> 01:12:38,954
To hell with him!

600
01:12:41,418 --> 01:12:48,381
Yingming was smart to start his own business.

601
01:12:50,302 --> 01:12:52,461
- Sorry I'm late.
- Haiyan, you're here.

602
01:12:52,637 --> 01:12:53,753
- You're here.
- Yup.

603
01:12:53,929 --> 01:12:56,849
Have you had dinner?
I'll heat up some leftovers for you.

604
01:12:57,018 --> 01:12:59,853
- Right.
- I'm fine. I'm taking Haohao to his grandma.

605
01:13:00,188 --> 01:13:02,476
- Haohao, time to go.
- Let me finish this.

606
01:13:02,648 --> 01:13:04,771
- Hurry up!
- Let me finish, please.

607
01:13:06,527 --> 01:13:08,983
- Where's your coat? They can't stop playing.
- Here's his coat.

608
01:13:09,153 --> 01:13:10,612
Liyun, listen.

609
01:13:10,738 --> 01:13:13,574
Today they caught a family
hiding out in the village.

610
01:13:13,742 --> 01:13:15,699
The mother was seven months along.

611
01:13:16,452 --> 01:13:19,952
What were these folks thinking?
Putting themselves through such torture.

612
01:13:21,708 --> 01:13:24,164
- Say goodbye.
- Goodbye, Uncle and Auntie.

613
01:13:24,295 --> 01:13:26,001
- Goodbye, Haohao.
- See you.

614
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:27,630
Watch your steps.

615
01:13:27,798 --> 01:13:29,126
Let's go.

616
01:14:09,630 --> 01:14:11,173
Comrades!

617
01:14:11,759 --> 01:14:14,842
Today, we have a new agenda
for our meeting.

618
01:14:16,929 --> 01:14:18,756
This is neither an award ceremony

619
01:14:18,932 --> 01:14:20,842
nor an annual review.

620
01:14:23,311 --> 01:14:26,811
It concerns key decisions on livelihood.

621
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:32,104
Every crisis harbors an opportunity.

622
01:14:33,655 --> 01:14:39,161
I know full well
that each worker's welfare is at stake.

623
01:14:41,831 --> 01:14:45,117
And their ripple effect
on the whole organization.

624
01:14:47,626 --> 01:14:50,545
Patriotism knows neither latitude
nor longitude.

625
01:14:50,715 --> 01:14:53,835
When you're feeling low,
forget not our nation's plight.

626
01:14:53,967 --> 01:14:57,881
"Serve your country
before sewing your own interests."

627
01:14:58,054 --> 01:14:59,086
You're the one who forgets it!

628
01:14:59,599 --> 01:15:01,554
- Comrades!
- Get to the point!

629
01:15:01,724 --> 01:15:04,300
We Chinese have along history
of selfless patriotism.

630
01:15:05,438 --> 01:15:07,063
Let me give you an example.

631
01:15:08,356 --> 01:15:10,398
The country is in jeopardy, comrades!

632
01:15:10,568 --> 01:15:12,523
- What jeopardy?
- Spit it out!

633
01:15:12,693 --> 01:15:15,019
If the enemy is at your doorstep,

634
01:15:15,197 --> 01:15:17,322
What shall soldiers do, comrades?

635
01:15:17,492 --> 01:15:20,778
- What shall soldiers do?
- What do you want to say?

636
01:15:20,952 --> 01:15:25,282
They sacrifice themselves without hesitation.

637
01:15:26,041 --> 01:15:29,492
They'll lay down their lives for the homeland.

638
01:15:31,588 --> 01:15:33,130
Comrades, please.

639
01:15:33,925 --> 01:15:36,380
Now let's come back to us, OK?

640
01:15:36,550 --> 01:15:40,631
Our factory is in financial doldrums.

641
01:15:41,224 --> 01:15:44,889
Our workforce is too large to sustain

642
01:15:46,354 --> 01:15:50,054
so many workers.
So what can we do?

643
01:15:50,233 --> 01:15:52,902
- It's your fault! No lay-offs!
- To relieve...

644
01:15:53,693 --> 01:15:57,822
To relieve the factory's burden,
we must sacrifice our state-guaranteed jobs.

645
01:15:58,407 --> 01:16:03,153
There's no shame in redundancy, comrades,
and even higher honor in re-employment.

646
01:16:04,996 --> 01:16:06,372
Therefore,

647
01:16:06,956 --> 01:16:10,456
some of you must make the sacrifice
and seek employment elsewhere.

648
01:16:11,336 --> 01:16:14,420
Listen to me, comrades.
We're in a market economy now.

649
01:16:14,590 --> 01:16:17,260
Our industry has undergone reform, too.

650
01:16:17,385 --> 01:16:20,054
Understand?
No more iron rice bowls!

651
01:16:20,220 --> 01:16:22,461
- You can't just fire us.
- You should get sacked first!

652
01:16:22,597 --> 01:16:24,139
Comrades!

653
01:16:25,268 --> 01:16:27,391
There's no shame in redundancy.

654
01:16:28,144 --> 01:16:32,059
- And even higher honor in reemployment.
- You can't lay us off like this!

655
01:16:32,233 --> 01:16:34,474
As long as you work hard...

656
01:16:35,110 --> 01:16:38,978
As long as you work hard
with your own hands,

657
01:16:39,613 --> 01:16:42,947
you can still help
to build our great socialist country.

658
01:16:43,117 --> 01:16:46,155
- We want our job!
- We want our job!

659
01:16:48,956 --> 01:16:50,951
Comrades, think about it.

660
01:16:51,461 --> 01:16:53,121
Listen to your own conscience:

661
01:16:53,295 --> 01:16:56,961
"The country is in jeopardy.
If I don't step down, who will?"

662
01:16:57,131 --> 01:16:58,675
You step down first!

663
01:16:59,217 --> 01:17:00,878
- Silence!
- You step down first!

664
01:17:04,014 --> 01:17:05,804
Enough, comrades.

665
01:17:05,974 --> 01:17:10,054
I'll announce the names
on the redundancy list.

666
01:17:13,814 --> 01:17:17,813
"The phoenix that dies in flames
will rise again from the ashes."

667
01:17:18,362 --> 01:17:22,443
I'll read out the lay-off list now.

668
01:17:23,282 --> 01:17:25,324
Be quiet! Please!

669
01:17:26,412 --> 01:17:27,988
From the Sorting Department,

670
01:17:28,746 --> 01:17:30,028
Zhang Yan.

671
01:17:30,206 --> 01:17:31,784
- Will you accept this?!
- No!

672
01:17:31,958 --> 01:17:34,247
- Huo Jianguo.
- No, we won't!

673
01:17:37,546 --> 01:17:39,421
Quiet! Quiet!

674
01:17:40,134 --> 01:17:41,878
Feng Xiaobo.

675
01:17:42,052 --> 01:17:44,921
- Give us our jobs back!
- Yu Yonggang.

676
01:17:45,139 --> 01:17:47,179
Wang Tianquan.

677
01:17:48,224 --> 01:17:49,934
Wang Liyun.

678
01:18:04,074 --> 01:18:06,827
Give us our jobs back!

679
01:19:07,054 --> 01:19:08,300
Hello?

680
01:19:23,820 --> 01:19:25,979
I really couldn't make a decision on my own.

681
01:19:29,202 --> 01:19:31,112
Like I said over the phone.

682
01:19:31,662 --> 01:19:32,742
From...

683
01:19:36,501 --> 01:19:37,782
From that one time...

684
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:41,376
I found out on the day
I got my U.S. visa.

685
01:19:45,592 --> 01:19:47,798
Man plans, God laughs.

686
01:20:04,987 --> 01:20:07,063
Does your brother know?

687
01:20:08,197 --> 01:20:09,858
What am I to tell him?

688
01:20:10,534 --> 01:20:12,242
That I'm pregnant

689
01:20:12,827 --> 01:20:14,027
and you're the father?

690
01:20:46,237 --> 01:20:47,979
Don't worry. It's still early.

691
01:20:53,994 --> 01:20:55,737
Don't beat yourself up.

692
01:20:56,996 --> 01:20:58,492
We're adults.

693
01:21:00,416 --> 01:21:02,826
Go talk to Liyun about this.

694
01:21:04,005 --> 01:21:05,996
I'm staying for a few more days.

695
01:21:07,465 --> 01:21:10,586
I know how much it means to both of you.

696
01:21:12,679 --> 01:21:14,505
If you want to keep the child,

697
01:21:15,099 --> 01:21:16,675
I won't go to the U.S.

698
01:21:18,019 --> 01:21:19,559
until after the birth.

699
01:21:24,273 --> 01:21:26,563
But what about yourself?

700
01:21:30,197 --> 01:21:31,905
Don't worry about me.

701
01:21:33,326 --> 01:21:35,032
I've thought it through.

702
01:21:36,037 --> 01:21:37,912
Maybe this is karma.

703
01:21:39,289 --> 01:21:42,657
- Payback for my brother and sister-in-law.
- Payback?

704
01:21:48,005 --> 01:21:50,046
This isn't about paybacks.

705
01:21:52,220 --> 01:21:53,501
This is...

706
01:22:01,311 --> 01:22:03,186
Think about the child.

707
01:22:05,233 --> 01:22:08,483
Growing up with... without a mother.

708
01:22:09,778 --> 01:22:12,981
Liyun will make a better mother than me.

709
01:22:14,742 --> 01:22:17,909
Don't drag Liyun into this.

710
01:22:19,746 --> 01:22:22,237
That's not the point, not at all.

711
01:22:23,960 --> 01:22:25,702
Don't tell her it's my child.

712
01:22:29,965 --> 01:22:32,170
I'll return to Beijing after your decision.

713
01:22:32,467 --> 01:22:34,509
Tell Liyun it's someone else's.

714
01:22:38,139 --> 01:22:40,014
This is my own doing.

715
01:22:41,644 --> 01:22:43,519
It's me who came to you.

716
01:22:46,398 --> 01:22:49,317
I can't pretend I didn't want it myself.

717
01:22:51,403 --> 01:22:54,523
When you left, I wanted to go after you.

718
01:22:55,782 --> 01:22:57,608
But I was too young then.

719
01:22:58,202 --> 01:23:00,657
I just couldn't bear to see you two suffer.

720
01:23:03,166 --> 01:23:04,577
This time,

721
01:23:06,335 --> 01:23:08,577
I knew exactly what I was doing.

722
01:23:12,090 --> 01:23:13,881
After I leave,

723
01:23:16,804 --> 01:23:19,128
I don't think we'll see each other again.

724
01:23:21,224 --> 01:23:22,970
I'm not young anymore.

725
01:23:29,233 --> 01:23:31,108
I didn't expect this.

726
01:23:33,653 --> 01:23:35,894
I thought I'd be happy.

727
01:23:36,740 --> 01:23:38,153
But...

728
01:23:39,242 --> 01:23:41,117
now that I'm here,

729
01:23:41,912 --> 01:23:43,903
I'm suddenly scared.

730
01:23:45,416 --> 01:23:47,907
I wanted to tell Liyun the truth myself,

731
01:23:48,293 --> 01:23:51,128
and ask her for forgiveness.

732
01:23:55,425 --> 01:23:57,381
I'm sorry, Yaojun.

733
01:24:00,054 --> 01:24:02,296
Am I being immature?

734
01:25:25,639 --> 01:25:28,095
MISSING PERSON: LIU XING

735
01:25:32,188 --> 01:25:33,766
Something strange happened today.

736
01:25:34,192 --> 01:25:35,472
What was it?

737
01:25:38,695 --> 01:25:40,523
On my way out,

738
01:25:42,867 --> 01:25:45,619
I saw a woman on an incoming ferry.

739
01:25:46,996 --> 01:25:49,037
She was obviously not a local.

740
01:25:50,456 --> 01:25:52,414
She seemed so familiar,

741
01:25:54,670 --> 01:25:56,746
but I couldn't recall who she was.

742
01:26:04,429 --> 01:26:06,470
That happens sometimes.

743
01:26:14,023 --> 01:26:15,518
Just like

744
01:26:16,818 --> 01:26:19,356
the moment we arrived here.

745
01:26:23,949 --> 01:26:26,653
It felt as if we'd been here in a past life.

746
01:26:30,789 --> 01:26:32,070
That's true.

747
01:26:40,465 --> 01:26:41,795
I was thinking.

748
01:26:44,845 --> 01:26:46,505
When I...

749
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:49,342
die,

750
01:26:53,354 --> 01:26:55,345
will it be here

751
01:26:55,688 --> 01:26:57,563
or in our hometown?

752
01:26:59,652 --> 01:27:02,523
We agreed not to bring this up again.

753
01:27:08,034 --> 01:27:10,360
If I lose you, too,

754
01:27:12,414 --> 01:27:14,407
how could I go on?

755
01:27:14,958 --> 01:27:17,081
What's with you today?

756
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:30,639
Yaojun,

757
01:27:33,019 --> 01:27:35,224
if you want a divorce,

758
01:27:37,981 --> 01:27:39,938
I'll accept it.

759
01:29:18,956 --> 01:29:20,536
I don't know

760
01:29:21,586 --> 01:29:24,125
if it was a woman's sixth sense.

761
01:29:34,222 --> 01:29:35,469
It's true.

762
01:29:40,813 --> 01:29:42,722
I also felt

763
01:29:44,817 --> 01:29:47,735
someone watching me across the water.

764
01:29:50,697 --> 01:29:52,608
I didn't dare to look.

765
01:29:57,121 --> 01:30:01,367
Liyun and I only have each other to live for.

766
01:30:04,545 --> 01:30:06,121
Especially Liyun.

767
01:30:10,175 --> 01:30:13,010
She won't survive another blow.

768
01:30:17,809 --> 01:30:20,097
But you've wanted a child for so long.

769
01:30:26,148 --> 01:30:28,438
Only if the child is our own.

770
01:30:33,532 --> 01:30:35,692
If we do this,

771
01:30:37,494 --> 01:30:39,487
I'll be hurting three people.

772
01:30:41,872 --> 01:30:43,072
Liyun.

773
01:30:43,751 --> 01:30:44,829
The child.

774
01:30:47,086 --> 01:30:48,286
And you.

775
01:30:52,385 --> 01:30:53,795
I understand.

776
01:31:01,726 --> 01:31:03,934
Maybe this is my fate.

777
01:31:06,063 --> 01:31:07,809
I'm resigned to it.

778
01:31:16,492 --> 01:31:17,951
Xingxing!

779
01:31:18,367 --> 01:31:19,827
Xingxing!

780
01:31:26,961 --> 01:31:28,537
Take him to the hospital!

781
01:31:51,652 --> 01:31:53,608
Whose idea was it?

782
01:31:55,072 --> 01:31:56,354
Tell me!

783
01:32:00,912 --> 01:32:02,867
How many times have I told you?

784
01:32:03,037 --> 01:32:04,996
Don't go down to the reservoir.

785
01:32:05,206 --> 01:32:06,784
Why don't you listen?

786
01:32:07,918 --> 01:32:10,077
Why don't you?

787
01:32:13,215 --> 01:32:17,795
Was it your idea or Xingxing's?

788
01:32:18,929 --> 01:32:20,387
Say something!

789
01:32:23,391 --> 01:32:24,804
Say something.

790
01:32:32,068 --> 01:32:33,894
Just tell me!

791
01:32:37,947 --> 01:32:41,814
You won't be eating anything until you tell me.
I'll let you starve.

792
01:32:41,992 --> 01:32:44,068
How many times have I told you?

793
01:32:44,246 --> 01:32:46,536
Don't go down to the reservoir!

794
01:32:46,706 --> 01:32:49,327
Tell me what we should do now!

795
01:33:03,889 --> 01:33:07,592
Don't you dare cry.

796
01:33:25,912 --> 01:33:27,905
Don't raise your voice.

797
01:33:28,081 --> 01:33:32,662
The neighbors can hear you.

798
01:33:41,470 --> 01:33:44,425
If you yell like this,
you'll scare the boy.

799
01:33:57,068 --> 01:33:58,612
What shall we do?

800
01:34:00,030 --> 01:34:01,144
Tell me.

801
01:34:34,063 --> 01:34:36,021
The boy's scared to death.

802
01:34:37,568 --> 01:34:39,939
He won't say anything.

803
01:34:42,238 --> 01:34:46,284
We've sent him to his grandparents

804
01:34:47,411 --> 01:34:51,028
and asked the school for some time off.

805
01:34:57,461 --> 01:34:59,751
Let's not tell him what happened yet.

806
01:35:03,175 --> 01:35:05,336
If he asks about Xingxing,

807
01:35:08,557 --> 01:35:11,474
just say he's with his grandma.

808
01:35:28,492 --> 01:35:30,202
It's Haohao's fault.

809
01:35:30,829 --> 01:35:33,036
I've cautioned him so many times.

810
01:35:33,497 --> 01:35:36,750
- Do not take Xingxing to the reservoir.
- Enough.

811
01:35:40,380 --> 01:35:42,170
They're just kids.

812
01:35:43,134 --> 01:35:44,795
You can't blame them.

813
01:35:48,179 --> 01:35:49,461
Blame me, please.

814
01:35:51,559 --> 01:35:54,845
I've spoiled Haohao too much.

815
01:35:57,898 --> 01:36:00,057
I'll give him a good beating at home.

816
01:36:00,233 --> 01:36:01,858
Cut it out.

817
01:36:05,322 --> 01:36:06,780
I'm tired.

818
01:36:13,162 --> 01:36:14,824
Get some rest.

819
01:36:15,206 --> 01:36:16,997
We'll head back now.

820
01:36:24,550 --> 01:36:26,175
Chairman Wang is here, too.

821
01:36:30,222 --> 01:36:31,550
Take care.

822
01:36:39,731 --> 01:36:40,929
Sis...

823
01:37:06,967 --> 01:37:08,545
How shameless they are.

824
01:37:09,554 --> 01:37:10,501
Enough.

825
01:37:37,121 --> 01:37:39,197
How can we make up for this?

826
01:37:41,293 --> 01:37:43,416
Xingxing was their only child.

827
01:37:47,048 --> 01:37:49,041
He didn't have to be their only one.

828
01:37:54,180 --> 01:37:55,510
Pardon?

829
01:38:09,322 --> 01:38:10,862
You know what I mean.

830
01:38:13,282 --> 01:38:14,992
I dare you to say that again.

831
01:38:15,202 --> 01:38:16,661
That's enough.

832
01:38:17,412 --> 01:38:20,034
Moli, Why dredge it up again?

833
01:38:20,706 --> 01:38:23,117
I feel sorry for Yaojun and Liyun.

834
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:28,168
What are you insinuating?
That this was my fault?

835
01:38:29,759 --> 01:38:31,798
Don't you blame this on me.

836
01:38:32,595 --> 01:38:34,586
What did I do wrong?

837
01:38:35,930 --> 01:38:37,211
Spell it out.

838
01:38:38,599 --> 01:38:40,143
Please.

839
01:38:40,309 --> 01:38:42,019
Give it a rest.

840
01:38:42,269 --> 01:38:44,144
Haohao can hear us.

841
01:39:21,226 --> 01:39:22,853
Do you want to eat something?

842
01:39:43,206 --> 01:39:45,162
What's wrong? Is it your tummy?

843
01:39:52,590 --> 01:39:55,000
It's OK. We're going home.

844
01:40:00,682 --> 01:40:02,141
Don't cry.

845
01:40:09,817 --> 01:40:13,648
The fever made him talk nonsense, right?

846
01:40:13,820 --> 01:40:16,655
What he said couldn't be true.

847
01:40:19,702 --> 01:40:23,746
He was probably really shaken up.

848
01:40:24,289 --> 01:40:25,570
That's right.

849
01:40:26,125 --> 01:40:30,170
And probably under too much stress.

850
01:40:36,425 --> 01:40:38,052
What should we do now?

851
01:40:40,179 --> 01:40:41,295
What to do?

852
01:40:41,599 --> 01:40:43,139
Go to bed.

853
01:40:58,824 --> 01:41:00,070
Don't cry.

854
01:41:03,537 --> 01:41:04,568
Listen to me.

855
01:41:05,956 --> 01:41:09,289
Never mention this to Haohao.

856
01:41:13,796 --> 01:41:17,747
But what about Yaojun and Liyun?

857
01:41:25,809 --> 01:41:27,599
This is unforgivable.

858
01:43:55,960 --> 01:43:57,206
Out of my way!

859
01:43:57,501 --> 01:43:59,081
No, don't you dare!

860
01:44:01,881 --> 01:44:02,961
Drive faster!

861
01:44:11,974 --> 01:44:13,256
Give it a rest.

862
01:44:57,063 --> 01:44:59,684
- Let's have another round!
- OK.

863
01:45:01,442 --> 01:45:03,186
Thank you, Auntie.

864
01:45:04,612 --> 01:45:05,689
Help yourselves.

865
01:45:11,577 --> 01:45:12,905
Liu Xing,

866
01:45:13,829 --> 01:45:15,655
come over for a second.

867
01:45:18,708 --> 01:45:20,086
Come on.

868
01:45:23,255 --> 01:45:24,831
Help yourselves.

869
01:45:56,996 --> 01:45:58,278
Xingxing,

870
01:45:59,000 --> 01:46:00,992
are they from your school?

871
01:46:04,086 --> 01:46:05,202
No.

872
01:46:06,005 --> 01:46:07,666
Then who are they?

873
01:46:10,050 --> 01:46:11,333
Friends.

874
01:46:11,760 --> 01:46:13,256
Friends?

875
01:46:15,891 --> 01:46:17,635
They don't go to school?

876
01:46:19,686 --> 01:46:20,719
No.

877
01:46:21,396 --> 01:46:23,023
Just like me.

878
01:46:26,402 --> 01:46:27,563
Xingxing,

879
01:46:29,487 --> 01:46:31,813
do you know how hard we tried to find you?

880
01:46:34,202 --> 01:46:38,532
Can't you see you're letting everyone down?

881
01:46:39,414 --> 01:46:40,909
What do I care?

882
01:46:44,586 --> 01:46:47,755
The missing person notice said
I have an ID card now.

883
01:47:42,394 --> 01:47:43,936
Leave it.

884
01:47:48,858 --> 01:47:50,483
If it's come to this,

885
01:47:54,990 --> 01:47:57,693
What else do we have to evade?

886
01:48:25,644 --> 01:48:28,019
Since you've made up your mind,

887
01:48:29,523 --> 01:48:31,849
we won't force you to stay here.

888
01:48:33,695 --> 01:48:36,530
Here's your ID card as we promised,

889
01:48:37,699 --> 01:48:38,945
and some money.

890
01:48:39,117 --> 01:48:42,155
It's not a lot, so be careful with it.

891
01:48:44,581 --> 01:48:46,537
This ID card

892
01:48:47,585 --> 01:48:52,211
makes you an adult
and grants you legal status.

893
01:48:53,590 --> 01:48:56,000
Go and get a job.

894
01:48:57,052 --> 01:48:59,673
Don't make us worry about you anymore.

895
01:49:07,854 --> 01:49:10,974
Mom and Dad are very grateful to you.

896
01:49:12,818 --> 01:49:17,195
We turned you into a stand-in for Xingxing.

897
01:49:18,447 --> 01:49:20,689
And you played along.

898
01:49:21,911 --> 01:49:23,702
To make us happy.

899
01:49:28,083 --> 01:49:29,827
Tod ay,

900
01:49:32,170 --> 01:49:35,456
we give you back your true identity.

901
01:49:39,929 --> 01:49:41,255
Zhou Yongfu.

902
01:49:54,277 --> 01:49:56,019
One more thing.

903
01:49:59,363 --> 01:50:01,606
If you get into trouble out there,

904
01:50:02,534 --> 01:50:05,202
remember how I used to beat you up.

905
01:52:41,693 --> 01:52:42,643
Moli?

906
01:52:42,862 --> 01:52:43,858
Yaojun.

907
01:52:44,778 --> 01:52:45,729
It's you.

908
01:52:46,113 --> 01:52:48,487
Come on in, it's cold outside.

909
01:52:48,867 --> 01:52:50,064
Liyun?

910
01:52:50,202 --> 01:52:51,530
Moli is here.

911
01:52:51,827 --> 01:52:52,826
Sis.

912
01:52:52,996 --> 01:52:54,407
Have a seat.

913
01:52:58,251 --> 01:52:59,876
I've brought you some dumplings.

914
01:53:00,045 --> 01:53:01,956
Haiyan and my brother made them.

915
01:53:05,342 --> 01:53:06,755
Have a seat.

916
01:53:07,094 --> 01:53:08,800
It's been a long time.

917
01:53:10,847 --> 01:53:12,045
- Hot water.
- Thanks.

918
01:53:12,224 --> 01:53:13,682
It's cold outside.

919
01:53:18,271 --> 01:53:19,684
Have you eaten yet?

920
01:53:19,898 --> 01:53:23,268
- I'll boil some dumplings for you.
- No, I'm good.

921
01:53:24,987 --> 01:53:26,612
Have some water.

922
01:53:41,253 --> 01:53:43,921
Meiyu and Xinjian are back.

923
01:53:47,717 --> 01:53:49,545
They dropped by earlier.

924
01:53:53,974 --> 01:53:56,726
They suggested getting together
tomorrow night.

925
01:53:57,144 --> 01:53:59,599
So I wanted to come and invite you.

926
01:54:06,612 --> 01:54:08,318
You all have a good time.

927
01:54:08,905 --> 01:54:10,567
We'll pass.

928
01:54:20,585 --> 01:54:24,500
So Xinjian made Meiyu his wife after all.

929
01:54:26,755 --> 01:54:28,997
When he followed her to Hainan,

930
01:54:29,175 --> 01:54:31,300
I knew it'd work out.

931
01:55:23,773 --> 01:55:25,268
It's the little Chinese New Year.

932
01:55:35,032 --> 01:55:38,485
Liyun, those dumplings are stuffed with fennel.

933
01:55:38,662 --> 01:55:40,537
My brother said you like them.

934
01:55:44,001 --> 01:55:45,708
Let me pour you more water.

935
01:55:45,876 --> 01:55:47,041
Thanks.

936
01:56:00,309 --> 01:56:01,554
Careful, it's hot.

937
01:56:27,586 --> 01:56:29,128
So you've been well?

938
01:56:38,389 --> 01:56:39,800
And you?

939
01:56:42,224 --> 01:56:44,135
We get by.

940
01:56:45,688 --> 01:56:47,349
Everything is fine.

941
01:56:56,113 --> 01:56:57,278
Oh, Haiyan!

942
01:57:03,162 --> 01:57:04,871
Happy New Year!

943
01:57:07,251 --> 01:57:09,077
It's your auntie!

944
01:57:09,670 --> 01:57:11,746
Or rather "Godmother!"

945
01:57:17,385 --> 01:57:20,220
- What's the baby's name?
- Just call it "Baby."

946
01:57:28,729 --> 01:57:30,224
Little sweetie!

947
01:57:30,608 --> 01:57:32,148
Say "Auntie!"

948
01:57:32,608 --> 01:57:34,068
It's "Godmother!"

949
01:57:43,996 --> 01:57:45,702
- How are you, Xinjian?
- Fine.

950
01:57:46,541 --> 01:57:47,952
You look good.

951
01:57:52,086 --> 01:57:54,329
Meiyu, your face is red.

952
01:57:54,505 --> 01:57:56,666
- How about you?
- We're very well.

953
01:58:04,057 --> 01:58:05,552
The flame's too big.

954
01:58:11,273 --> 01:58:13,184
Is everything OK with Haiyan?

955
01:58:18,237 --> 01:58:20,278
She has problems sleeping,

956
01:58:20,867 --> 01:58:22,740
and she babbles.

957
01:58:24,537 --> 01:58:27,987
She's paranoid that others
talk behind her back.

958
01:58:28,875 --> 01:58:32,824
You better keep a closer eye on her.
Let her get some time off.

959
01:58:36,380 --> 01:58:38,755
I already told her to quit her job.

960
01:58:39,844 --> 01:58:41,753
We're getting by better now.

961
01:58:43,472 --> 01:58:45,548
We don't need her measly salary.

962
01:58:49,936 --> 01:58:52,095
So you haven't caught up

963
01:58:52,898 --> 01:58:54,724
with them for years?

964
01:59:05,912 --> 01:59:07,322
I have visited them.

965
01:59:08,537 --> 01:59:10,613
They were very polite to me.

966
01:59:17,171 --> 01:59:19,746
But we had nothing to say to each other.

967
01:59:26,639 --> 01:59:28,300
We used to

968
01:59:29,099 --> 01:59:30,974
be so close.

969
01:59:34,273 --> 01:59:39,268
Liyun and Yaojun don't blame you at all.

970
01:59:42,405 --> 01:59:45,905
So much time has passed since the accident.

971
01:59:47,286 --> 01:59:49,528
Don't think about it anymore, OK?

972
01:59:50,206 --> 01:59:52,530
You have to move on.

973
01:59:53,208 --> 01:59:55,746
You don't get it. Cut it out.

974
01:59:56,586 --> 01:59:58,793
I know, I understand.

975
01:59:59,046 --> 02:00:01,371
Don't be too hard on yourself.

976
02:00:02,092 --> 02:00:04,085
You were just doing your job.

977
02:00:04,970 --> 02:00:08,006
You didn't have a choice.

978
02:00:09,516 --> 02:00:10,974
Stop, stop, Haiyan.

979
02:00:14,938 --> 02:00:17,264
OK,OK.

980
02:07:37,340 --> 02:07:38,454
Liyun!

981
02:07:39,090 --> 02:07:40,086
Liyun!

982
02:08:37,567 --> 02:08:39,023
Help!

983
02:08:39,818 --> 02:08:40,814
Doctor!

984
02:09:05,094 --> 02:09:07,170
Dr Shen, I'll be direct.

985
02:09:07,929 --> 02:09:11,345
Her condition isn't looking good.

986
02:09:11,849 --> 02:09:13,429
I'm afraid the diagnosis is final.

987
02:09:14,269 --> 02:09:15,219
I see.

988
02:09:20,108 --> 02:09:23,858
If you want her to remain hospitalized,
I can make arrangements accordingly.

989
02:09:29,577 --> 02:09:30,903
That won't be necessary.

990
02:09:31,577 --> 02:09:34,282
Don't tell the patient yet.

991
02:10:54,452 --> 02:10:56,411
Is it that serious?

992
02:11:00,541 --> 02:11:02,168
It could be anytime,

993
02:11:02,336 --> 02:11:04,211
if something

994
02:11:05,296 --> 02:11:07,539
like this happens again.

995
02:11:15,224 --> 02:11:17,050
What about surgery?

996
02:11:19,269 --> 02:11:20,644
Not recommended.

997
02:11:22,104 --> 02:11:25,059
The tumor is too big now,
pressing against the nerves.

998
02:11:26,277 --> 02:11:28,186
It's been diagnosed as malignant.

999
02:11:30,822 --> 02:11:33,231
You haven't told your mom, have you?

1000
02:11:33,992 --> 02:11:35,237
Not yet.

1001
02:12:00,144 --> 02:12:02,930
How could you let her do all the cooking?

1002
02:12:03,396 --> 02:12:04,974
Mom, let me help you.

1003
02:12:05,148 --> 02:12:06,179
No, no, no.

1004
02:12:06,358 --> 02:12:08,518
I can handle it. Relax.

1005
02:12:09,237 --> 02:12:11,394
- Mom, let us do it.
- Don't worry.

1006
02:12:11,780 --> 02:12:13,655
- Are you still feeling dizzy?
- Not anymore.

1007
02:12:13,824 --> 02:12:16,148
After a whole day's sleeping, I'm well now.

1008
02:12:16,911 --> 02:12:17,907
Hurry.

1009
02:12:18,577 --> 02:12:19,824
My little baby!

1010
02:12:20,456 --> 02:12:22,081
Go sit down.

1011
02:12:23,333 --> 02:12:24,579
Take it easy.

1012
02:12:44,104 --> 02:12:45,302
Here, here, here.

1013
02:12:47,314 --> 02:12:48,479
Thanks, Mom.

1014
02:12:49,108 --> 02:12:51,269
Something strange is going on.

1015
02:12:52,153 --> 02:12:54,822
Guess who I dreamed about recently.

1016
02:12:55,322 --> 02:12:56,568
Who?

1017
02:12:58,367 --> 02:12:59,994
Liyun and Yaojun.

1018
02:13:00,162 --> 02:13:01,193
Who?

1019
02:13:01,371 --> 02:13:04,456
You don't know them.
My godparents when I was young.

1020
02:13:04,708 --> 02:13:07,376
Really?
You've never mentioned them before.

1021
02:13:08,586 --> 02:13:10,746
I dreamed of them too, some time ago.

1022
02:13:11,465 --> 02:13:12,876
What do you think this means?

1023
02:13:14,342 --> 02:13:15,969
It means nothing, just a dream.

1024
02:13:16,929 --> 02:13:18,470
More than that.

1025
02:13:20,264 --> 02:13:22,055
I was thinking...

1026
02:13:23,269 --> 02:13:26,554
If I were to die all of a sudden,

1027
02:13:27,523 --> 02:13:29,349
my biggest regret

1028
02:13:30,400 --> 02:13:33,438
would be not seeing them again.

1029
02:13:33,862 --> 02:13:35,737
You're talking nonsense again.

1030
02:13:36,572 --> 02:13:40,157
It's been so many years.
Maybe they've forgotten us already.

1031
02:13:41,452 --> 02:13:42,865
They couldn't have.

1032
02:13:44,747 --> 02:13:46,028
Mom,

1033
02:13:46,416 --> 02:13:49,916
I have to go to work.
Listen to the doctor.

1034
02:13:50,670 --> 02:13:54,881
No dancing or strenuous activity.
Be sure to get some rest, OK?

1035
02:14:10,733 --> 02:14:12,309
Take your medicine.

1036
02:14:49,019 --> 02:14:51,559
You've kept in touch with them, right?

1037
02:15:01,992 --> 02:15:04,233
Moli paid them a visit

1038
02:15:04,494 --> 02:15:06,121
before she left

1039
02:15:06,496 --> 02:15:08,452
and gave me their number.

1040
02:15:10,541 --> 02:15:12,536
But I never called them.

1041
02:15:20,720 --> 02:15:22,427
Give them a call.

1042
02:15:27,349 --> 02:15:29,840
Invite them over for my birthday.

1043
02:15:33,189 --> 02:15:35,349
We'll pay for the trip.

1044
02:15:40,197 --> 02:15:41,942
Do we have to?

1045
02:15:51,041 --> 02:15:53,032
Just tell them

1046
02:15:57,880 --> 02:15:59,671
I'm dying.

1047
02:16:01,050 --> 02:16:02,925
Before I go,

1048
02:16:04,554 --> 02:16:06,880
I want to see them.

1049
02:16:09,099 --> 02:16:10,809
What's this nonsense?

1050
02:16:26,408 --> 02:16:28,237
I want them to know

1051
02:16:29,829 --> 02:16:31,703
that over the past 20 years,

1052
02:16:33,084 --> 02:16:35,076
for me, Li Haiyan,

1053
02:16:35,877 --> 02:16:39,496
not a day has passed
without me thinking of them.

1054
02:17:12,623 --> 02:17:17,617
Dear passengers, please return
to your seat due to the turbulence.

1055
02:17:18,043 --> 02:17:22,755
Or sit tight and wear a seat belt.
Please don't move around the cabin.

1056
02:17:23,176 --> 02:17:26,010
Please take care of your children.

1057
02:17:26,471 --> 02:17:27,751
Thank you.

1058
02:17:36,061 --> 02:17:38,055
Isn't it funny

1059
02:17:40,443 --> 02:17:42,567
we're still afraid of dying?

1060
02:17:48,867 --> 02:17:50,493
Dear passengers,

1061
02:17:50,786 --> 02:17:53,906
Flight CA272 to Beijing

1062
02:17:54,079 --> 02:17:55,577
is ready for boarding.

1063
02:17:55,832 --> 02:18:00,495
Please bring your belongings to Gate 5.

1064
02:18:40,793 --> 02:18:42,372
Aren't you cold?

1065
02:18:42,796 --> 02:18:44,505
It's alright.

1066
02:18:45,465 --> 02:18:47,340
It's good to feel cold.

1067
02:18:47,718 --> 02:18:50,671
We haven't felt this cold for years.

1068
02:18:58,729 --> 02:19:02,229
Have you heard from the boy?

1069
02:19:03,900 --> 02:19:04,980
Who?

1070
02:19:06,070 --> 02:19:07,399
No.

1071
02:19:12,117 --> 02:19:14,443
He has to renew his ID card.

1072
02:19:15,079 --> 02:19:16,325
Right.

1073
02:19:16,873 --> 02:19:19,909
Every citizen's card
will get a new chip installed.

1074
02:19:20,625 --> 02:19:21,575
Sister,

1075
02:19:23,463 --> 02:19:26,463
- have you told our old man I'm here?
- Not yet.

1076
02:19:26,590 --> 02:19:29,461
He might get overexcited.

1077
02:19:50,281 --> 02:19:52,900
I barely recognize this place.

1078
02:19:54,409 --> 02:19:57,743
The streets are wider now.
The old building opposite was demolished?

1079
02:19:57,872 --> 02:19:59,698
All these are new.

1080
02:20:00,999 --> 02:20:02,625
Let me take the bags.

1081
02:20:02,793 --> 02:20:04,918
Everything looks so different.

1082
02:20:06,797 --> 02:20:08,588
Wait for me, please.

1083
02:20:12,720 --> 02:20:14,049
Thank you.

1084
02:20:20,143 --> 02:20:22,302
Our old block hasn't changed.

1085
02:20:23,231 --> 02:20:27,775
All that talk about demolishing it
was just talk.

1086
02:20:31,489 --> 02:20:33,279
Do people still live here?

1087
02:20:35,034 --> 02:20:38,202
Some moved out,
others sublet their units.

1088
02:20:38,912 --> 02:20:41,617
But your building has been left alone.

1089
02:20:44,251 --> 02:20:47,704
Natural gas and broadband are installed,

1090
02:20:48,296 --> 02:20:50,207
except in yours.

1091
02:20:51,258 --> 02:20:53,797
With so few residents left,

1092
02:20:54,677 --> 02:20:56,422
nobody cares anymore.

1093
02:21:13,947 --> 02:21:16,356
Every winter when the heat com es on,

1094
02:21:16,784 --> 02:21:19,240
I come by to drain the radiators.

1095
02:21:19,745 --> 02:21:21,868
The heating is no good.

1096
02:21:23,374 --> 02:21:27,123
I wanted to clean up the apartment

1097
02:21:28,043 --> 02:21:31,829
and buy some winter bedding for you.

1098
02:21:36,345 --> 02:21:38,469
MASSAGE

1099
02:21:43,268 --> 02:21:47,480
Then I thought it's best to leave it up to you.

1100
02:21:48,315 --> 02:21:50,141
If it's too uncomfortable here,

1101
02:21:50,650 --> 02:21:52,478
come stay with us.

1102
02:21:53,613 --> 02:21:55,570
OK, thank you.

1103
02:23:56,861 --> 02:23:58,356
Son...

1104
02:25:12,018 --> 02:25:14,722
Excuse me, Where is Li Haiyan's room?

1105
02:25:15,313 --> 02:25:18,600
Li Haiyan? She's in number 11.
Down the hallway.

1106
02:25:19,025 --> 02:25:21,400
- I see. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1107
02:25:50,558 --> 02:25:52,052
Have we made it in time?

1108
02:25:52,225 --> 02:25:53,304
Yes.

1109
02:26:08,784 --> 02:26:09,981
Xinjian.

1110
02:26:36,103 --> 02:26:37,302
Yingming.

1111
02:27:10,972 --> 02:27:12,633
Haohao, come here.

1112
02:27:14,349 --> 02:27:16,177
Greet your godparents.

1113
02:27:17,894 --> 02:27:19,722
Look, you're a big boy now.

1114
02:27:20,856 --> 02:27:22,185
Godfather.

1115
02:27:27,113 --> 02:27:28,275
Haohao.

1116
02:27:29,447 --> 02:27:30,481
Godmother.

1117
02:27:33,368 --> 02:27:34,995
You're taller than me.

1118
02:27:56,600 --> 02:27:58,177
Haiyan.

1119
02:27:59,979 --> 02:28:01,520
Haiyan.

1120
02:28:04,650 --> 02:28:07,320
Liyun and Yaojun are here for you.

1121
02:28:17,162 --> 02:28:18,409
Haiyan.

1122
02:28:20,249 --> 02:28:22,076
It's me, Liyun.

1123
02:28:23,336 --> 02:28:25,909
Yaojun and I have come to see you.

1124
02:28:41,144 --> 02:28:42,805
What do you want to say?

1125
02:28:44,774 --> 02:28:46,268
I'm listening.

1126
02:28:48,569 --> 02:28:50,027
We are

1127
02:28:51,404 --> 02:28:53,363
rich now.

1128
02:28:54,784 --> 02:28:56,908
No need to be afraid.

1129
02:28:58,204 --> 02:29:03,364
We can help you
pay the fine for a new baby.

1130
02:29:26,649 --> 02:29:29,650
I've missed you so much.

1131
02:30:06,397 --> 02:30:08,436
- We're leaving.
- OK, OK.

1132
02:30:09,400 --> 02:30:10,561
Thank you.

1133
02:30:10,984 --> 02:30:13,143
- My condolences.
- Thank you.

1134
02:30:14,404 --> 02:30:15,864
Take care. Watch your step.

1135
02:30:31,046 --> 02:30:33,501
- Take care of yourself.
- OK, thank you.

1136
02:30:41,431 --> 02:30:43,222
Watch your step.

1137
02:30:43,559 --> 02:30:45,136
Farewell. Thank you.

1138
02:30:57,365 --> 02:30:59,404
- How's everybody doing?
- Everyone's well.

1139
02:30:59,951 --> 02:31:02,025
See my old buddies from the factory?

1140
02:31:02,661 --> 02:31:05,746
They're in great shape.
They don't even have any gray hair.

1141
02:31:07,834 --> 02:31:10,704
Why don't you and Liyun
stay here a bit longer?

1142
02:31:11,337 --> 02:31:13,163
The city has really changed.

1143
02:31:13,338 --> 02:31:15,046
Yes, don't leave again.

1144
02:31:15,508 --> 02:31:18,925
At our age, we should be spending time
together. Just like old times.

1145
02:31:20,263 --> 02:31:22,052
I'm afraid that's not gonna happen.

1146
02:31:22,222 --> 02:31:23,469
Why not?

1147
02:31:23,641 --> 02:31:25,965
Yingming could get you an apartment.

1148
02:31:28,229 --> 02:31:30,435
What are we talking about?

1149
02:31:31,274 --> 02:31:33,480
Yaojun says he can't move back here.

1150
02:31:33,650 --> 02:31:37,268
Why don't you put them up
in one of the condos you're building.

1151
02:31:37,864 --> 02:31:39,570
I'd be more than happy.

1152
02:31:40,115 --> 02:31:42,489
Haiyan never stopped nagging me to do it.

1153
02:31:42,827 --> 02:31:46,659
Let me take you around
my housing developments.

1154
02:31:47,165 --> 02:31:49,704
If one catches your eye, it's yours.

1155
02:31:50,250 --> 02:31:51,995
And what if we can't afford it?

1156
02:31:54,421 --> 02:31:55,454
Where's Haohao?

1157
02:31:57,340 --> 02:32:00,343
He was here a minute ago.
He must've gone to the restroom.

1158
02:32:00,470 --> 02:32:01,715
I'll check.

1159
02:32:02,679 --> 02:32:03,962
Stay here.

1160
02:32:04,181 --> 02:32:05,130
I'll go.

1161
02:32:05,308 --> 02:32:06,684
Help yourselves.

1162
02:32:10,186 --> 02:32:11,765
When's your due date?

1163
02:32:11,938 --> 02:32:13,185
Very soon.

1164
02:32:16,194 --> 02:32:18,567
It's a shame Haiyan won't see the baby.

1165
02:32:25,953 --> 02:32:27,659
So you've made up your mind?

1166
02:32:36,963 --> 02:32:39,124
This has tortured us

1167
02:32:40,176 --> 02:32:42,549
for far too long.

1168
02:32:44,805 --> 02:32:46,882
I don't want to be like Mom.

1169
02:32:48,225 --> 02:32:50,266
Burdened with guilt until the end.

1170
02:32:52,897 --> 02:32:58,236
It was neither your fault, nor your mother's.

1171
02:32:58,527 --> 02:33:01,647
I know. No one's blaming Mom.

1172
02:33:02,782 --> 02:33:04,572
She was just doing her job.

1173
02:33:08,371 --> 02:33:12,368
But I know how she really felt deep down.

1174
02:33:22,927 --> 02:33:24,172
So...

1175
02:33:24,761 --> 02:33:27,170
- should I get them over here?
- No.

1176
02:33:31,143 --> 02:33:34,641
I'll drive them home.

1177
02:33:37,315 --> 02:33:39,061
Shall I join you?

1178
02:33:39,275 --> 02:33:40,391
No.

1179
02:33:50,412 --> 02:33:51,954
So much has changed, right?

1180
02:33:54,584 --> 02:33:56,125
Where are we now?

1181
02:33:57,962 --> 02:33:59,752
This used to be Wuyi Square.

1182
02:33:59,921 --> 02:34:01,915
Qingnian Road is over there.

1183
02:34:02,090 --> 02:34:05,508
We just drove past
where the auditorium used to be.

1184
02:34:07,513 --> 02:34:08,629
Gosh!

1185
02:34:09,181 --> 02:34:11,970
- They tore that down too?
- They sure did.

1186
02:34:20,484 --> 02:34:23,355
Most of the old factory dormitories are gone.

1187
02:34:23,570 --> 02:34:27,698
Ours is one of the few still around.

1188
02:34:29,452 --> 02:34:30,993
Right.

1189
02:34:32,662 --> 02:34:34,989
There's almost no trace of our past.

1190
02:35:22,004 --> 02:35:22,953
We're here.

1191
02:35:24,588 --> 02:35:26,132
Thank you, Haohao.

1192
02:35:30,427 --> 02:35:32,090
Godfather, Godmother...

1193
02:35:33,181 --> 02:35:34,759
may I come up for a second?

1194
02:35:35,059 --> 02:35:37,183
- Yes.
- Of course, of course!

1195
02:35:37,353 --> 02:35:38,680
Just park the car here.

1196
02:35:38,855 --> 02:35:40,231
Come on.

1197
02:36:07,300 --> 02:36:10,337
We could've stayed with Yaojun's sister.

1198
02:36:12,096 --> 02:36:13,590
But we wanted

1199
02:36:13,847 --> 02:36:15,675
to be back here again.

1200
02:36:17,560 --> 02:36:20,265
We've been away for too long.

1201
02:36:22,273 --> 02:36:24,515
Does anything look familiar to you?

1202
02:36:26,611 --> 02:36:27,606
Come in.

1203
02:36:27,777 --> 02:36:28,727
Please.

1204
02:36:28,904 --> 02:36:30,231
Come on in.

1205
02:36:31,865 --> 02:36:33,740
Let me give you some water.

1206
02:36:33,992 --> 02:36:35,820
- Put on some tea leaves.
- OK.

1207
02:36:43,043 --> 02:36:46,792
You still remember this place, right?
Nothing has changed here.

1208
02:36:47,713 --> 02:36:49,920
It's exactly as we left it.

1209
02:36:51,969 --> 02:36:54,129
We're only here for a few days.

1210
02:36:54,304 --> 02:36:56,049
No point in rearranging things.

1211
02:36:57,891 --> 02:36:59,933
Same old furniture.

1212
02:37:00,102 --> 02:37:02,141
Appliances are old, too.

1213
02:37:11,445 --> 02:37:13,488
We were tidying up and somehow

1214
02:37:13,658 --> 02:37:15,448
the photo ended up there.

1215
02:37:16,577 --> 02:37:18,570
Haohao, sit down.

1216
02:37:18,871 --> 02:37:20,697
Have some tea.

1217
02:37:25,252 --> 02:37:26,793
Put more tea leaves in.

1218
02:37:26,963 --> 02:37:29,632
No, that's plenty already.

1219
02:37:35,721 --> 02:37:36,718
Godfather.

1220
02:37:38,391 --> 02:37:39,802
Godmother.

1221
02:37:42,728 --> 02:37:45,681
Please sit down so I can tell you something.

1222
02:38:02,038 --> 02:38:03,829
We're listening.

1223
02:38:12,508 --> 02:38:15,925
This has been weighing on me all these years.

1224
02:38:18,097 --> 02:38:20,719
Now Mother's funeral has brought us

1225
02:38:21,309 --> 02:38:23,016
back together.

1226
02:38:25,186 --> 02:38:26,847
I think

1227
02:38:27,773 --> 02:38:30,525
it's time to share it with you.

1228
02:38:41,829 --> 02:38:43,490
That day,

1229
02:38:45,707 --> 02:38:48,959
when we decided to go to the reservoir,

1230
02:38:52,297 --> 02:38:54,172
we agreed

1231
02:38:54,675 --> 02:39:00,014
to stay near the shore.

1232
02:39:02,097 --> 02:39:03,891
But Xingxing

1233
02:39:04,310 --> 02:39:05,971
wouldn't go.

1234
02:39:08,105 --> 02:39:10,016
I was annoyed,

1235
02:39:10,900 --> 02:39:12,940
so I left him there.

1236
02:39:14,987 --> 02:39:21,570
Then the other kids started making fun of him.

1237
02:39:24,663 --> 02:39:26,573
This embarrassed me.

1238
02:39:28,042 --> 02:39:30,166
So I told him,

1239
02:39:30,793 --> 02:39:34,329
if he didn't get down to the reservoir

1240
02:39:35,800 --> 02:39:38,634
I'd stop being his friend.

1241
02:39:43,891 --> 02:39:45,931
So he came down.

1242
02:39:55,527 --> 02:39:57,436
A while later,

1243
02:39:58,990 --> 02:40:00,864
the other kids

1244
02:40:02,034 --> 02:40:05,238
started swimming towards deeper water.

1245
02:40:07,165 --> 02:40:09,739
I told him to join them,

1246
02:40:11,210 --> 02:40:15,042
but he was too timid.

1247
02:40:16,338 --> 02:40:17,965
Sol

1248
02:40:18,551 --> 02:40:22,336
dragged him towards the reservoir.

1249
02:40:26,475 --> 02:40:31,102
Xingxing was so scared, he screamed,

1250
02:40:32,356 --> 02:40:34,681
and grabbed onto me.

1251
02:40:34,983 --> 02:40:38,899
The other boys kept teasing us.

1252
02:40:40,865 --> 02:40:43,106
I got really angry.

1253
02:40:48,748 --> 02:40:50,290
Then I...

1254
02:40:53,293 --> 02:40:57,755
Then I nudged him into the water.

1255
02:41:06,431 --> 02:41:08,425
I gave him a push.

1256
02:41:20,070 --> 02:41:21,898
What did your

1257
02:41:23,073 --> 02:41:25,445
parents say about this?

1258
02:41:31,749 --> 02:41:35,996
You didn't ask me,
because you wanted to protect me.

1259
02:41:37,088 --> 02:41:40,918
My parents kept silent for the same reasons.

1260
02:41:42,259 --> 02:41:44,051
They hoped

1261
02:41:44,761 --> 02:41:49,886
that with time, I'd forget it all.

1262
02:41:51,016 --> 02:41:52,394
However,

1263
02:41:53,729 --> 02:41:58,474
from that day on,
I've felt this thing inside me.

1264
02:42:00,361 --> 02:42:04,275
It was like a tree, growing bigger as I grew.

1265
02:42:05,032 --> 02:42:09,826
It feels like it's going to explode from my body.

1266
02:42:10,287 --> 02:42:12,613
I can't stand it anymore.

1267
02:42:13,832 --> 02:42:16,407
I have to tell you the truth.

1268
02:42:24,552 --> 02:42:26,793
Let it out, Son.

1269
02:42:29,140 --> 02:42:30,801
You'll feel better.

1270
02:43:01,338 --> 02:43:03,793
Take this and chop that little bastard in half.

1271
02:43:04,883 --> 02:43:06,925
An eye for an eye.

1272
02:43:18,856 --> 02:43:20,434
You're crazy!

1273
02:43:22,525 --> 02:43:24,353
Shen Yingming, I'm telling you.

1274
02:43:25,488 --> 02:43:29,650
Never bring this up with Haohao.

1275
02:43:31,077 --> 02:43:33,034
Not one word.

1276
02:43:34,247 --> 02:43:35,704
You hear me?

1277
02:43:41,963 --> 02:43:43,209
You and Haiyan,

1278
02:43:44,047 --> 02:43:46,420
stop blaming your child.

1279
02:43:54,934 --> 02:43:56,760
For as long as you live,

1280
02:43:59,147 --> 02:44:01,186
don't say a word.

1281
02:44:05,111 --> 02:44:07,068
Xingxing is gone.

1282
02:44:09,490 --> 02:44:11,731
We must take good care of Haohao.

1283
02:44:17,665 --> 02:44:19,704
He's just a child.

1284
02:44:21,961 --> 02:44:24,036
If you never mention it,

1285
02:44:26,257 --> 02:44:28,213
he'll put it behind him.

1286
02:47:23,641 --> 02:47:25,054
Put it down.

1287
02:47:25,561 --> 02:47:27,766
Let's clear away the grass first.

1288
02:48:36,883 --> 02:48:38,460
Son,

1289
02:48:40,635 --> 02:48:43,175
Mom and Dad have come to visit you.

1290
02:51:48,990 --> 02:51:50,153
Yes?

1291
02:51:51,828 --> 02:51:53,284
Haohao?

1292
02:51:55,413 --> 02:51:56,826
OK!

1293
02:52:00,336 --> 02:52:02,126
OK,OK, OK.

1294
02:52:05,715 --> 02:52:07,127
I'm hanging up.

1295
02:52:09,802 --> 02:52:10,965
The baby?

1296
02:52:11,429 --> 02:52:12,629
The baby.

1297
02:52:13,097 --> 02:52:14,641
Boy or girl?

1298
02:52:15,184 --> 02:52:16,561
Boy,

1299
02:52:16,727 --> 02:52:18,139
a big boy!

1300
02:52:20,106 --> 02:52:21,600
How wonderful.

1301
02:52:24,694 --> 02:52:27,481
- Godfather, Godmother, come in!
- Congrats.

1302
02:52:27,654 --> 02:52:29,315
Thank you, come in.

1303
02:52:29,490 --> 02:52:31,150
Wow, look who's here.

1304
02:52:31,909 --> 02:52:33,367
Congratulations, Yingming.

1305
02:52:33,534 --> 02:52:35,161
Come meet your grandson.

1306
02:52:35,579 --> 02:52:37,988
You really didn't need to bring anything.

1307
02:52:38,166 --> 02:52:40,204
You're a granddad now.
We should celebrate.

1308
02:52:41,668 --> 02:52:43,079
This is Grandpa.

1309
02:52:48,426 --> 02:52:49,802
This is Grandma.

1310
02:52:50,635 --> 02:52:52,095
He's smiling!

1311
02:52:52,263 --> 02:52:55,097
Let Grandma hold you.

1312
02:52:56,600 --> 02:52:58,345
Give us a smile.

1313
02:53:00,936 --> 02:53:02,100
Any name yet?

1314
02:53:02,314 --> 02:53:05,399
The names I came up with all got rejected.

1315
02:53:06,650 --> 02:53:07,981
Have a seat.

1316
02:53:09,906 --> 02:53:12,609
Let's call him Dudu.

1317
02:53:13,784 --> 02:53:15,159
That's cute!

1318
02:53:19,499 --> 02:53:22,168
Auntie Moli, can you see us?

1319
02:53:22,918 --> 02:53:24,626
Look Who's here.

1320
02:53:25,087 --> 02:53:26,582
Moli!

1321
02:53:27,047 --> 02:53:29,088
It's been an eternity!

1322
02:53:29,425 --> 02:53:32,130
Moli!
Don't I look young after all these years?

1323
02:53:33,929 --> 02:53:35,921
Liyun, you're back.

1324
02:53:36,681 --> 02:53:41,096
Moli, you haven't changed at all.
You still look so young.

1325
02:53:42,647 --> 02:53:44,308
You can't be serious.

1326
02:53:46,818 --> 02:53:48,775
- Are you well?
- Yes.

1327
02:53:52,572 --> 02:53:55,408
Moli, where is Sunny? Go fetch him.

1328
02:53:55,742 --> 02:53:57,368
Wait a second.

1329
02:54:00,790 --> 02:54:02,579
Sunny? Who is that?

1330
02:54:03,125 --> 02:54:05,415
- Moli's son.
- Who would've thought?

1331
02:54:06,168 --> 02:54:08,543
She never wanted a family.

1332
02:54:08,756 --> 02:54:10,796
And now she has a big boy already.

1333
02:54:13,219 --> 02:54:15,176
Well, she changed her mind.

1334
02:54:16,347 --> 02:54:18,091
He's coming.

1335
02:54:19,684 --> 02:54:21,011
Do you rem ember me?

1336
02:54:21,185 --> 02:54:22,929
Hello, even/body!

1337
02:54:24,647 --> 02:54:26,853
Hello! How do you do?

1338
02:54:31,612 --> 02:54:33,986
Sunny, hello!

1339
02:54:34,823 --> 02:54:37,314
Look who we have here.

1340
02:54:38,578 --> 02:54:41,150
You're an uncle. Meet your nephew, Dudu.

1341
02:54:44,332 --> 02:54:47,086
She must be the great-aunt...

1342
02:54:47,587 --> 02:54:49,163
Call her great-auntie.

1343
02:54:49,421 --> 02:54:53,337
Moli, we are all great-aunts now.

1344
02:55:37,720 --> 02:55:40,258
XING REPAIR SHOP

1345
02:56:06,165 --> 02:56:08,040
Hey, who are you looking for?

1346
02:56:11,587 --> 02:56:14,624
If you miss any snacks from home, tell me.
I'll have them sent over.

1347
02:56:37,613 --> 02:56:38,561
Hello?

1348
02:56:39,823 --> 02:56:42,065
Hello, is this Liu Yaojun?

1349
02:56:50,042 --> 02:56:51,371
Dad?

1350
02:56:52,502 --> 02:56:54,293
It's me, Xingxing.

1351
02:56:55,381 --> 02:56:56,959
Xingxing.

1352
02:57:18,153 --> 02:57:21,737
Mom is right here, too.
She wants to hear your voice.

1353
02:57:22,115 --> 02:57:23,278
Xingxing is back.

1354
02:57:25,659 --> 02:57:26,858
Hello?

1355
02:57:28,122 --> 02:57:29,499
Xingxing!

1356
02:57:30,832 --> 02:57:32,374
You're home.

1357
02:57:34,962 --> 02:57:37,916
We came back to visit friends
in our hometown.

1358
02:57:38,965 --> 02:57:40,793
We'll be back soon.

1359
02:57:42,220 --> 02:57:43,547
Xingxing,

1360
02:57:43,929 --> 02:57:46,338
Mom and Dad miss you very much.

1361
02:57:54,689 --> 02:57:56,102
Son?

1362
02:57:56,275 --> 02:57:58,897
Take care of my business.

1363
02:58:00,278 --> 02:58:03,565
No doubt, you're also the boss!

1364
02:58:06,327 --> 02:58:08,034
Hold on, "Boss Liu."

1365
02:58:09,037 --> 02:58:12,740
Xingxing, how long will you stay this time?

1366
02:58:15,252 --> 02:58:16,961
That's great.

1367
02:58:20,299 --> 02:58:23,337
You've brought your girlfriend with you?

1368
02:58:23,760 --> 02:58:25,421
Xingxing has a girlfriend!

1369
02:58:26,264 --> 02:58:28,054
That's even better!

1370
02:58:31,518 --> 02:58:33,227
Great!

1371
02:58:36,606 --> 02:58:39,525
We're very well, don't worry about us.

1372
02:58:42,279 --> 02:58:45,814
We'll be back soon.

1373
02:58:47,784 --> 02:58:49,195
Wait for us, Son.
